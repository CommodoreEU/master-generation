A great idea saves a lousy caricature, and, trust me, there are a few cartoonists who get what I would define as likenesses, but not true caricatures. Caricatures capture in a few strokes what the intended target's essence is, without a single word.\nOne of my very talented colleagues, Joel Pett, is always kind of downplaying his caricature ability in private conversations with his peers. And yet he manages to really nail people in a devastating manner--ask him to draw Mitch McConnell for you sometime. So, he's wrong.\nTom Toles is another cartoonist who is really amazing at a simple yet effective caricature. He, too, kind of pooh-poohs his talents in this regard.\nMost cartoonists would also agree that in our profession, Kevin Kallaugher (KAL) is really top-notch as well. I recall one time sitting around with him talking about Clinton caricatures. I drew one, and he said, that's close, but you got the eyes wrong. They slant up instead of down. Huh.\nHe was right, and I hadn't noticed it.\nGood caricaturists notice things like that.\nKAL also drew what I considered the most accurate caricature of me I had ever seen.

        "prompt": "This series on affordable housing was made possible in part through the support of Tides Canada Foundation, the Catherine Donnelly Foundation, and the Van Tel/Safeway Credit Union Legacy Fund, held and managed by Vancity Community Foundation.\nHow a lock-off suite fits into a larger apartment. Credit: Perkins & Co.\nHigh atop Burnaby Mountain stands a housing solution that could unlock one of the thorniest problems facing Vancouver and other expensive B.C. cities: Where to house the students, artists and other working singles who are critical to creating an information-based economy.\nThe City of Burnaby may be the first municipality in the world to legalize secondary suites within apartments -- also called lock-off suites -- that enable owners of condominiums to do what owners of houses have done for decades: rent out extra space.\n\"Basement suites provide the most affordable housing in the Lower Mainland,\" said architect and planner Michael Geller. \"Some of these basement suites are legal; most are not. Some remain as rental housing in perpetuity; others are taken over by the homeowner as family size increases, or family finances improve.\"\nA longtime advocate of Flex Housing, Geller was president of the SFU Community Trust during the development of UniverCity, a planned community of up to 4,500 homes on 200 acres adjacent to Simon Fraser University.\n\"Both the university and the City of Burnaby wanted to provide some affordable housing for students within the community. However, the university did not want to use high value land for student housing, especially since it might \"de-value\" the adjacent condominium sites,\" Geller explained.\n\"So the question we asked ourselves was: Why not create the equivalent of a basement suite in a fifth-floor apartment?\" he said.\n\"The answer came from resort architecture. We've all been in a hotel room or suite where, through a series of interlocking doors, two individual rooms can be joined as one suite,\" Geller said.\nAfter considerable negotiation, the City of Burnaby amended its bylaws to approve lock-off suites within up to half of the apartments and townhomes at UniverCity. The suites must be at least 240 square feet. They are permitted to have their own entry from the corridor, as well as their own bathroom and cooking facilities.\n\"When we initially thought of this concept, we expected these suites would be the third bedroom in a three-bedroom unit,\" Geller said. \"However, the first units to be built were in fact two bedroom units, where the second bedroom could either be the master bedroom, or a separate suite.\"\n\"I am quite certain that nowhere else in North America -- or for that matter, in the world -- has another municipality developed a specific zoning bylaw to govern suites within apartments,\" Geller said. \"Burnaby did it in 2002. And Vancouver is looking into it now.\"\nThe Burnaby Mountain lock-off suites are not \"affordable\" in the strictest sense.\nIn fact, Geller figures they cost between $20,000 and $30,000 more than the same-sized unit with ensuite bathrooms but without lock-off capability. Included in this amount is the extra door to the corridor, more fire-proofing between living quarters, an additional electrical panel and wiring, and parking.\n\"In order to increase affordability, the city agreed that it would relax its normal parking requirements,\" Geller said. \"Only one space was provided for every four secondary suites.\"\nBut the existence of the lock-off suites -- and, specifically, the prospect of their rental income -- has made these relatively expensive apartments more purchase-able, because lenders have regarded a portion of the anticipated rent as income.\n\"This allows a young family to get into the suite they might not otherwise afford. And later, when kids need their own room, they can take over the whole suite,\" Geller said.\n\"Some people would argue that costs inherent in making a home flexible are too great,\" Geller said. \"Particularly recognizing that, at least in North America, we have a propensity to move quite frequently. Others might argue that our propensity to move is a result of the fact that our homes can't change as our needs change.\"\nThe lock-off suites have not proven cheap to rent, either. These tiny bachelor suites -- ranging in size from 240 to 285 square feet -- fetch from $525 to $750 per month.\n\"They rented for much more than I expected,\" Geller said. \"Still, they rent for considerably less than for a conventional one-bedroom suite.\"\nBut while the rents are quite high on a per-foot basis, these tiny suites are cheaper than almost anything other than a substandard basement suite or an aging residential hotel.\nThis may prove to be the lock-off suite's greatest advantage: It serves the most extremely under-served gap in British Columbia's expensive urban rental markets.\nIn Vancouver, newly built or recently renovated one-bedroom apartments in walkable neighbourhoods rent for about $1,200 a month. Basement suites fetch $750. And a bug-infested room in an aging residential hotel runs to almost $600 a month -- if one can be found.\nThis leaves students, artists, and other young singles priced out of the market. It also serves as a profound disincentive for the province's tens of thousands of mentally ill and frequently addicted citizens to better",

        "prompt": "‘Multi-tasking Writ Large’: Is American Health Care Reform a Prescription for Trouble?\nUsing two decades of data, Wharton health care professors Lawton R. Burns and Mark V. Pauly recently dissected the cost-cutting component of the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While the title of their research paper, published in Health Affairs, was \"Accountable Care Organizations May Have Difficulty Avoiding the Failures of Integrated Delivery Networks of the 1990s,\" the authors had offered another, shorter title: \"Doomed to Fail?\"\nBurns and Pauly have teamed up before. In 2002, they analyzed health care initiatives in President Clinton's first administration that failed to become law. Subsequent books and articles looked at integrated delivery networks (IDNs), Clinton-era precursors to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). The new article compares current Obamacare ACO delivery models to IDNs in the 1990s in terms of their ability (or inability) to improve health care quality and lower costs.\nIn their day, IDNs attempted to coordinate physicians, hospitals, disease management programs and care delivery in alternative sites, but in looser arrangements than formal health maintenance organizations. Hospitals bought primary care physicians' practices and formed a variety of joint venture IDNs with doctors in an effort to gain leverage over insurers in negotiations keyed to per capita payments — an actuarially-based fixed fee per registered patient in lieu of fees for each physician service. However, IDNs failed to secure capitated contracts from payers and were unable to convince doctors to change the way they practiced, even when they employed them. IDNs were faulted for rewarding the volume of medical treatment rather than results, driving costs up with little regard to the quality of patient care. They eventually incurred substantial financial losses and closed down.\nThe Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are similar to IDNs in their attempts to integrate care as a way to cut costs and improve quality. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) — which serves as the payer for Medicare and Medicaid as well as a clearinghouse for guidance on health care infrastructure — last year released proposed rules for establishing ACOs made up of hospitals, doctors and other health care providers as a blueprint for this coordinated care initiative. Medicare will offer incentive payments to ACOs that are able to improve quality of care while eliminating redundant costs.\nBurns and Pauly aren't convinced that ACOs are the answer. While their data centers on Medicare, it has implications that apply to the whole health care sector. \"In this article, we ask how the current proposals differ from the earlier failed models,\" Burns and Pauly write in their paper, \"and whether any of the differences are large enough to yield better results this time.\" Their conclusions suggest that the dismal track record of Clinton era IDNs bodes ill for new reforms centered around ACOs.\nTheir research began after Burns accepted an invitation to speak about ACOs to alumni of the Kellogg School at Northwestern University. \"I didn't go in with a point of view,\" Burns says. \"I stumbled into it.\" In January 2011, he was wrapping up an extended focus on India's health care system for a global modular course he taught at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad,and was not focusing on health care developments in the U.S.\nThen, ahead of the Kellogg talk in May 2011, Burns spent three months boning up on ACOs, considered to be linchpins in the argument that government can afford to extend health care to millions of uninsured Americans because it will, at the same time, be able to reap billions of dollars in cost savings. In care coordination, disease management and health information technology, Burns soon realized it was déjà vu all over again. \"I began to recognize all these things we had talked about [regarding] the Clinton health care reform\" effort, says Burns. The more he looked, the more he saw that Obamacare was relying on money-saving outcomes that hadn't worked in the past.\nPauly, adding an economist's perspective to Burns' behaviorist view, agrees with this pessimistic appraisal of the current health care reform initiatives. \"So far in the natural evolution of the ACO concept,\" says Pauly, \"it does not seem that it will put pieces together in the right way.\" He gives two chief reasons. First, the only entities with enough organization, cash and clout to steer health care toward desired ends are hospitals, whose responsibility in general is to treat sick people. Keeping a whole population healthy is an altogether different goal, and requires brand new roles and systems, Pauly says.\nThe second reason looks intractable. For decades, health care has eluded heroic efforts to cut costs. Researchers constantly ask why the market's invisible hand does not demand efficiency in the health sector, as it does in most other sectors that cater to consumers. Hospitals that sought efficiencies in the 1990s seldom reduced costs, in part because physicians operated with separate, sometimes competing agendas. \"Nobody has figured out how to get doctors to work and play well with hospitals,\" Pauly says. Geographic distance between hospitals and doctors' offsite medical groups underscored diverging interests.\nBurns blames a lack of overall ownership of the health care system. Instead, it is crowded with stakeholders whose divergent interests add up to an administrative puzzle that no one has the power to solve. Health care reform as conceived requires too much from all stakeholders at once, says Burns, a case of \"multi-tasking writ large.\" What's more, half of the money comes from the federal government. \"You are not going to have efficient markets,\" Burns says, \"when government is a big payer and the price setter.\"\nUntil hospital CEOs gain authority to compel all actors in the health care delivery system, doctors included, to behave in a cost efficient manner, Pauly sees little chance for meaningful cost reduction. Experts describe this conundrum as \"competing agency costs\" and other formal-sounding terms, but Burns adopts a more succinct explanation. \"One person's costs are another person's income,\" Burns says. By that, he means cutting Medicare cost lowers income for doctors, a stubborn dynamic that impedes progress in health care.\nOther obstacles hamper efforts to lower health care costs. Not-for-profit hospitals lack the drive to keep costs low and profit margins healthy. If a doctor trims hospital costs, he or she seldom enjoys a direct benefit. Consumers lack incentive to police costs so long as Medicare or insurers pick up the tab. Worse, insured consumers usually choose the most expensive option where their health is concerned. To restrain costs, insurers introduced capitation payment in lieu of the traditional fee-for-service model. But that, in turn, may result in an incentive to stint on quality. Insurance companies, meanwhile, lack bargaining power relative to hospitals and doctors.\nHealth reform advocates seek what experts label the \"triple aim\": improved quality of care, gains in the health of the population at large and reduced cost. But none of it will happen, say Burns and Pauly, if the past is prologue. Their paper enumerates infrastructure features and capabilities for a successful ACO and, one by one, finds them wanting, from physician-hospital alignment and care coordination to disease management, patient-centered medical homes and health information technology.\nFor example, they report lackluster returns on care coordination among multiple providers. In 2002, the CMS funded 15 demonstrations of care coordination for Medicare populations. Only three sites reduced patient cost and admissions, and even at those sites, Medicare recorded no net savings after factoring in added fees for care coordination. Only one program is still active today.\n\"Evaluators concluded that care coordination alone 'holds little promise of reducing total Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries with chronic illness,'\" the authors report. And, notably, patients with chronic illnesses consume a whopping share of health care dollars.\nWhat about \"disease management,\" a hot topic in medical cost containment? \"Net program benefits — in terms of health or money — have remained elusive,\" Pauly and Burns write. \"The Congressional Budget Office found insufficient evidence that disease management programs for Medicare can even pay for themselves.\"\nConsider a concept called patient centered medical homes, where teams, led by primary care physicians, supervise comprehensive patient services. Results are mixed, at best. There is evidence that medical homes can \"bend the cost trend for a while and address the 'triple aim' [in] dominant, well established care networks with large staffs, strong institutional management and the capacity to manage change,\" the authors write. But these results are beyond the ability of smaller institutions — those that use the vast majority of medical resources consumed in the U.S. — to reach.\nLikewise, much touted health information technology, despite quantum advances in capacity and delivery of information since the 1990s, yield less potential than advocates believe. \"Overall,\" Burns and Pauly report, \"the evidence suggests that information technology is necessary but insufficient to improve outcomes.\" Clinical decision support systems are supposed to improve physician decision-making, reduce medical errors and standardize therapy. \"Evidence on the benefits of diagnostic assistance offered by electronic systems is mixed,\" write the authors, \"partly because physicians often ignore the systems' advice.\"\nElectronic health records have been hailed as a big advance sure to rescue health care. Again, the authors are pessimistic. They see a different bottom line, one with scant evidence that digital record-keeping can cut costs. In fact, employee training and implementation can pile on costs for up to seven years. The same is true for many other elements of accountable",

        "prompt": "Well, it does seem that fall is making its arrival. Leaves are slowly beginning to shed their summer green for more autumn hues and nights are just a bit on the nippy side.\nI am happy, though, that our local farmer's market still has lots of fresh vegetables and fruit to offer. During a recent visit on a Saturday morning, my wife Susanne and I came home with more than we really needed. But it all looked so good! As usual, I paged through the recipe book in my mind for some inspiration. This time it took me back to an unforgettable summer adventure in France.\nYears ago, Susanne and I were lucky enough to spend two weeks with friends from Toronto in a 'mas' (a Catalonian word for a country manor) in the southwestern corner of France. It was during the month of July so the weather was warm and the sun bright as could be. The country manor was located in a beautiful setting just off a mountain road. From the terrace on top of the 'mas' we could see the nearby Spanish border. That, we all decided, would be the ideal place for sunny, summer breakfasts.\nAfter doing a little cleaning, we decided it was time to take a short ride down the mountain road to the closest village. The scenery alone was worth the trip. There were all sorts of orchards, old country manors and even a sheep or two on the side of the road. After parking in the village, we decided to purchase some local food for the next few days. Susanne and I headed straight to the local bakery. To our surprise, there were crusty loaves of 'pain d'épeautre' (spelt bread) right in the bakery window. The baker explained how he produced the loaves and noted that the grain, an ancient relative of wheat, was common in the region. We purchased several loaves and then continued on our culinary venture through the narrow village streets.\nOur visit to the butcher was quite an educational experience as well. Monsieur Rodriquez explained that all the sausages and pâtés were homemade and that he also prepared all the meats. The salamis, hams and sausages all had names that would be familiar to many Spanish-speakers, especially the chorizo. Here the chorizo had much in common with the counterpart found in Spain. It was a sausage cured with paprika that could be sliced and eaten cold. The butcher kindly offered us a taste and we quickly decided to purchase some for an appetizer before our meal that evening. He asked if I was from the region because of my last name and the fact that I speak French. He added that many of his friends had names like Martinez, Fernandez and Lopez. In did tell him that, although I wasn't from the area, I certainly could get used to living there.\nAt the outdoor market there were all sorts of green and red bell peppers, onions, leeks, zucchini, carrots, cabbage and olives. There were fresh herbs and dried ones that one could use all year long. We also found a wide variety of melons, cherries, peaches, grapes and pears. Often merchants would offer a taste of the local fruits. After one bite it was simply too hard to resist making a purchase.\nA meal in that corner of the world wouldn't be complete without a glass of local wine and some cheese, so we couldn't forget those essentials either. We drove to a local wine producer recommended by the butcher. The man kindly allowed us to taste his wines. Maybe it was the sun, perhaps the surrounding countryside or even the wines themselves, but each glass tasted better than the last. Since we had purchased all sorts of food we chose several whites, rosés and reds. One the way back up the mountain we saw with a sign with a flying goat advertising local cheeses. We stopped at the rather crude looking establishment only to discover that the interior, where the cheeses were produced, was impeccably clean. The cheese maker, a man with only one tooth, was proud of his products and invited us to taste the cheeses. They were delicious and we purchased several kinds.\nThose two weeks we cooked almost every evening and enjoyed the riches of the land during breakfast, lunch and dinner either on the terrace of in the romantically lit dinning room.\nThere were some mishaps during our stay. One evening, some of us were chased through the surrounding forest by a wild boar. On yet another occasion, Susanne found a live scorpion in the door. Then there was the time when our friends' son had a bad brush with nettle bushes.\nBut, all in all, it was a wonderful stay. To this day, we all still talk about those times and really cherish them. And, with all the produce we've found at the farmer's market lately, I've had a good excuse to recreate some of the meals that we enjoyed during our stay in that sunny corner of southwestern France near the Spanish border.

Crouse excused.\nOLYMPIA – With strong bipartisan majorities in both houses, the Legislature passed a $33.6 billion operating budget Friday, staving off a threatened shutdown of some state government services.\nAfter a 105-day regular session, a first special session of 30 days and a second special session in its 16th day, a budget that some described as not having anything that everyone might want but enough things that most can support sailed through both chambers.\nGov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it Sunday, the last day of the fiscal year. Without the budget, the state wouldn’t have the legal authority to continue some programs and pay some salaries in the new fiscal year, which begins Monday.\nThe budget was the subject of months of negotiations, debates over the amount of money to be added to public schools or social service programs and taxes that would be raised or reduced.\nThe final product of those negotiations adds about $1 billion in new money for public schools, with an emphasis on all-day kindergarten for the state’s poorer schools, smaller class sizes in the earliest grades and an extra 80 hours of instruction for junior high and high school students. The state will also give school districts more financial help with transportation, maintenance, supplies and operating costs.\nThe budget freezes tuition at the state’s colleges and universities for this year, and makes it difficult to raise tuition next year. Sen. Mike Baumgartner, R-Spokane, who at one point proposed reducing tuition by 3 percent, called the freeze a victory considering that some legislators and Inslee proposed raising tuition at the beginning of the session.\n“It was a goal, but it was also a tactic,” Baumgartner said of the proposal to cut tuition.\nThe budget was notable for several reasons, said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville. For the first time since 1986, tuition at the state’s colleges and universities won’t go up, he said. A long list of tax increases proposed early in the session weren’t approved. Temporary taxes on service businesses and on some brands of beer, passed at the depths of the recession, will expire on Sunday as scheduled.\n“I’m afraid the whole system’s going to come crashing down upon us,” added Sen. Mike Padden, of Spokane Valley.\nIn fact, previous budgets drafted and passed by the predominantly Republican majority coalition included the expansion. Friday’s amendment failed on a 16-32 vote.\nRep. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, said the Medicaid expansion will affect an estimated 30,000 people in Spokane, about 24,000 who will become eligible for health coverage and about 6,000 people who are currently eligible but haven’t signed up.\nThe budget also contains $6 million for the new medical school",

And our neighbour is the largest consumer of drugs in the world. And everybody wants to sell him drugs through our doors and our windows,” he said.\nHe did not go into more detail, but the remarks appeared to be a softening of Calderon’s attitude towards state regulation of the market for drugs, which could curb the power of the cartels by taking away their profits.\nSixteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia have allowed the use of medical marijuana but the federal government does not recognise their authority to do so and considers the dispensaries illegal.\nMarijuana is becoming the drug of choice among young adults in the United States and the use of methamphetamines and cocaine is waning, according to a recent national survey.\nIn Mexico, Calderon sent in the army against drug gangs shortly after taking office in late 2006.

Few of us would board a commercial airplane, for instance, without feeling confident that the pilot was well trained and accredited. Occupational licenses are a way to set a clear competence bar in such activities.\nBut licensing also acts to mute competition by creating barriers to market entry. There are plenty of activities where licensing is unnecessary, or unnecessarily strict, which limits market dynamism and possibly social mobility, too.\nState governments are regulating more everyday professions through licensing, according to a recent report by the White House. In the 1950s, roughly 5 percent of jobs required a license; now that number is roughly 25 percent. Most of that rise comes from an increase in the number of professions that demand licenses, rather than from increased employment in already licensed professions. As a recent paper from the Brookings Hamilton Project shows, occupations now requiring a state license include hair-dressing, auctioneering, makeup artistry, and scrap metal recycling.\nLicensing laws increase prices between 3 and 16 percent, depending on the particular profession. In many cases, there are better ways to ensure quality and professionalism, especially in the era of Yelp and TripAdvisor. In many cases, the regulations simply protect incumbent businesses, and benefit the schools that train those aspiring to become licensed.

If Dennis didn't pay it back, it would just be deducted from his share of the estate, he says.\nWho was executor of the will? asks Veniot. Dennis and I, says McFadden. Also trustee of spousal trust and they appointed themselves directors/officers of the companies.\nBefore his death did Richard invest some of his money with Dennis as his broker? He had about $1 million on deposit with Dennis’ firm Wood Gundy.\nEver discuss the matter with Dennis? asks Veniot. Yes, once, at Dennis' office around 2010, says McFadden. Dennis asked him to talk to his father about it, he says. \"It was really a case of - maybe you should be more discrete,\" says McFadden.\nWhat was Richard’s practice as far as shutting his computers down at the end of the day? He would close all programs but leave the computers themselves turned on.\nHow soon were the directors of Richard’s businesses changed after his death? Pretty quickly. About 10 days.\nDid you ever discuss the matter with Richard? asks Veniot. No. Was never really an opportunity, he says.\nMichael Lacy begins cross examination of McFadden.\nDefence lawyer Michael Lacy is handling cross-examination of McFadden.

Lacy suggests conversation with Dennis would have occurred when McFadden was helping him with his divorce in 08/09. Most likely, yes.\nDid Dennis ever ask if you had that discussion with Richard? asks Lacy.\nNo, says McFadden. He never pressed you on it, asked if you were dealing with it? No. Was sort of a one-of conversation? Yes.\nYou mentioned 3 \"conditions\" related to the $538K , but the money was obviously advanced before anything was finalized, so it wasn't a 'condition' per se - just something Richard would \"like\" to have these things in place? asks Lacy. Yes.\n\"Cosmic coincidence\" Richard had a meeting about life insurance on July 6 (the day he was killed) and you also have on your list of things to do to talk about his will? asks Lacy. \"Yes...unconnected,\" replies McFadden.\nWhen police handed the office (crime scene) back over to you, you took photos for insurance purposes? asks Lacy. Yes, says McFadden. Lacy displays on courtroom monitor a photo of Richard's desk with blood-spattered documents, eyeglasses etc.\nMcFadden confirms that's what it looked like. Lacy zooms in on a document, which refers to Brice family history. You contacted police to see if they wanted it? McFadden says he doesn't recall that one specifically but told them he had all of the documents.\nYou recognized this as a genealogy-related document? asks Lacy. Yes, replies McFadden. You knew genealogy was something Richard and Dennis had been working on in the weeks and months before \"he died\"? Yes, I understood it to be a document Dennis possibly brought with him.\nPolice never came to get it? asks Lacy. No, says McFadden.

The region’s trade with China, which recently surpassed that between China and the US, is currently worth over $200bn a year and has undergone a staggering 20-fold increase since 2000.\nBut as intra-regional and South-South ties have strengthened, the challenges have inevitably grown more complex in this new continental order. With competing visions for the future, can Latin American leaders reach consensus?\nOn the domestic front, Chile and Brazil have recently witnessed mass demonstrations against controversial public spending policies.\nThe long-running US-led 'war on drugs' while dismantling some of Colombia’s most powerful cartels, has failed to contain the spread of violence and organised crime across borders.

But political boundaries redrawn in 2011 make it possible for Latino voters to elect just one of the five supervisors.\nThe administration has resisted calls to sue the county, despite the county's history of discrimination against Latino voters in earlier redistricting efforts.\nThe inaction rankles some Latino activists who count themselves as strong backers of President Barack Obama.\n\"I support the Obama administration and the president, but frankly, Obama and the top people around him seem to be unaware on this issue. Obama is somewhat blind to the issues of Latinos,\" said Cruz Reynoso, a former California Supreme Court justice and member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Reynoso said the administration seems more attuned to voting rights complaints of African-Americans.\nHe said the administration also appears reluctant to pursue a complaint against a jurisdiction that is dominated by Democrats. \"Most of the folk in Los Angeles have been supporters of the president, so why make them unhappy despite the fact that, from my point of view, there is great injustice going on,\" he said.\nIn the wake of a stinging U.S. Supreme Court defeat in June that rendered useless an important enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act, the administration has focused its voting rights resources on Southern states that are controlled by Republicans.\nThe Justice Department has initiated or joined suits targeting voter identification laws and redistricting plans in North Carolina and in Texas, where Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott began moving to put the state's tough voter ID law into effect just hours after the high court's decision.\nThe suits were filed under other provisions of the voting rights law that were not part of the Supreme Court case.\nThe situation in Los Angeles County predates the high court decision and the passage of the laws now being challenged in North Carolina and Texas.\nThe Justice Department acknowledges it is looking at the situation in Los Angeles, but otherwise declined comment.\n\"We have received significant amounts of information from the county and others about the issue and the matter is still under review,\" said Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson.\nMatt Barreto, a political science professor and voting rights expert at the University of Washington, said the evidence against the county is overwhelming and includes a history of racially polarized voting that has hurt Latinos.\n\"My perspective is that this is one of the easiest cases to be made nationally,\" said Barreto, who has worked for the group of Latinos that includes Reynoso. Barreto also served as a consultant to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a voter-approved independent board that draws the state's congressional and legislative districts.\nCounties, though, retain the authority to devise their own districts. Nowhere is there more power and money at stake than in Los Angeles, where each of five supervisors represents nearly 2 million people and the county's annual budget tops $26 billion.\nFollowing the 2010 census, the board adopted districts in 2011 that made relatively few changes even though two supervisors cautioned that their colleagues were exposing themselves to a voting rights lawsuit.\nGloria Molina, the only Latina ever elected to the board, and Mark Ridley-Thomas, the board's lone African-American member, supported maps that would have created a second district with a majority of Latino residents.

With a current attachment rate of almost eight games for every PS3, that's over 3.5 million Blu-ray Disc games that have been sold to date in Australia.\"\nMr Ephraim said the new plant should be a clear sign to consumers that Blu-ray is now a \"permanent fixture on the format landscape in Australia\" but PS3 owners will also be hoping the plant helps reduce local Blu-ray prices and ensures more timely releases.\n\"but PS3 owners will also be hoping the plant helps reduce local Blu-ray prices and ensures more timely releases. \"\nI guess any investment that creates & promotes australian jobs cant be sneered at.\nMy assumption is Blu-ray sales are at a point to justify the investment?\nThat attachment rate doesn't include 2nd hand games. I'm looking forward to the second hand bluray movie market opening up.\nThey're still to expensive for me to buy casually.\nOf course BD prices will reduce eventually. It's the exact same thing that happened with DVDs and CDs when they were first introduced. It's not rocket science people. Prices will drop but it takes time for the new technology to integrate into society. Besides, most JB stores already have 2-for-1 deals and bargain bins for BD.\nIt's interesting to see that Sony are still pushing the \"PS3 isn't expensive becuase it has a blu-ray player\" line considering the price of stand alone blu-ray players has dropped considerably.\nSpot on. If anything localy made blu-rays and games would be slightly more expensive given the price of labour and manufacturing in Australia when compared to some Asian countries.\nlol thanks Cannon for filling in for the troll today.\nSame reason why I haven't ventured into blu-ray yet. That and the fact that most of the DVDs I have are not available in blu-ray and probably not for a while (or ever).\nBut having something local is a good step. It will only be a matter of time though, before we see any real difference.\nSounds like it could be good news, but we'll wait and see. I care about cost, not the triumphant raising of a Blu-ray flag over Huntingwood.\nI have very few Blu-ray movies because the picture quality isn't 300% better than DVD but the price usually is.\n@Infinitum, if you have a large screen HD TV, the picture quality is at least 300% better than DVD. I still buy DVDs for SD TV shows and cartoons, but if it's a special effects driven or visual film, Blu-Ray is a must, the difference is night and day. If you have a small TV, I'd stick to the cheaper DVDs.\nWhy is Stephen Conroy there?\nIs he trying to secretly censor Blu Ray as well as the internets?\nYou are spot on. A recent action/effects driven movie like Iron Man, Die Hard 4.0, or the latest Hulk movie all look unbelievable on a large HD LCD TV on Blu Ray. With prices still averaging $30+ for BD it's a waste to bother with comedies and dramas. But if you want your explosions, monsters, zombies, bullet wounds, etc. to look the best possible Blu Ray completely craps all over DVD.\nI'm still scratching my head over older movies like Clockwork Orange or Breaker Morant receiving the Blu Ray treatment though. There is only so much you can do to film that is that old and low quality already.\nPeter, I have a 42\" HD (but not full HD) LCD TV. The only movies I would buy on BR are those sorts of special-effects driven movies and even then only recent ones. I've got a couple of double-ups of older movies and it's far from night and day on my setup, though I concede it would be running a side-by-side comparison of a new release on full HD TVs. But generally speaking at current prices - no thanks.\nActually some of the best looking BluRays I have are of older movies. Close Encounters of the Third Kind is incredible to watch in HD. Also The Thing on HDDVD is fantastic (Kurt Russells beard has never looked manlier).\nYou must remember that film has an incredible resoultion, so if effort is put into restoring it the outcome can be quite stunning.\nWho are they kidding!

Few would argue that this case, in which the Tigers lost last season's Ivy League Player of the Year, is an exception to that axiom. Looking at how the team has done so far, however, I can’t help but wonder if losing Hummer didn’t have some positive effects. Princeton is 6-1 and was three points away from defeating Butler in its only loss this season, whereas this time last year the Tigers were 3-5. They were averaging 57.6 points per game; they’re now averaging 71.3. Something good must be happening.\nNobody’s matching Hummer’s 16.3 points per game this season. Nobody needs to. The top five are outperforming last year’s top five, combining to put up over 6 more points per game. Nobody’s over 15 points per game, but five Tigers are averaging in the double digits, something only Hummer and then-sophomore forward Denton Koon did last season.\nWith Hummer gone, this year’s stars are spreading the wealth. Hummer was never a ball-hog —he led the team in assists last season —but a certain amount of ball-hoggery comes with the territory when you’re really, really good. Now, the Tigers can’t dish it off to Hummer and hope for the best, and they’re having success taking things into their own hands. Sophomore forward Hans Brase is taking twice as many shots per game as he did last year and is scoring twice as many points, while the already-prolific shooter Koon is taking almost three more shots per game.\nNobody’s shooting as much as Hummer, but two players are out-performing his 51.7 shooting percentage of 2012-13. Senior guard T.J. Bray is shooting 57.7 percent from the floor despite missing games with a hand injury (which, I would imagine, could negatively affect some people’s ability to shoot) and this weekend’s Rookie of the Week Spencer Weisz is shooting 61.8 percent. Senior forward Will Barrett is shooting 43.8, but, given that he led the Ivy League in field-goal percentage last season, I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to speculate that that number is going to go up quite a bit as the season goes on.\nThe Tigers are",

        "prompt": "A small study published Tuesday in the Archives of Neurology found preliminary evidence that spraying critical insulin deep into the nose could help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Ray Suarez speaks with University of Washington School of Medicine professor Suzanne Craft, who led the study.\nAn estimated five million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and there's no known cure. But a new trial offers some early promise for tackling the disease at its early stages, using a daily spritz of insulin.\nThe idea behind the trial was relatively simple: Patients with Alzheimer's disease lose critical insulin in the brain as their condition worsens. What if insulin could be supplemented?\nResearchers at the VA Medical Center in Washington state did just that. They gave patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease a nasal spray containing insulin twice a day for four months. Early results published in The Journal of Neurology today were encouraging. Insulin delayed memory loss and other problems.\nSuzanne Craft led the study at the VA and the University of Washington School of Medicine, where she's a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.\nAnd, Professor, a lot of people are familiar with insulin as the hormone that helps metabolize fat and carbohydrate. What does it do in the brain, and what led people to wonder if supplementing it might help with Alzheimer's?\nWell, you're right. The most well-known role of insulin is in treating diabetes. But, in the last few years, we have come to understand that insulin has a number of very important roles to play in the brain. In particular, it's very critical for memory, for memories — for memories to form.\nAnd it also protects against the toxic effects of proteins, like the amyloid protein, which is the protein that collects in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. And, interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease appear to have a deficiency of insulin in their brain or the insulin that is there doesn't work effectively.\nSo, that led us to wonder whether or not supplementing insulin would be of benefit to patients with Alzheimer's disease, possibly to improve their symptoms or to ameliorate their pathology.\nWell, we're still early in the course of this study. And it was a small one, right? How did you pick the people who were used in this research?\nYes, you're right. It is early in the life of this area of research.\nOur participants were patients with very early Alzheimer's disease. They either had the prodromal condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment or they had very mild, very early Alzheimer's disease. So they were volunteers who came to our clinics to be in our study.\nAnd once they used this insulin, what could you observe happening inside their brains?\nWell, we had three groups.\nWe had a group who received a placebo, an inactive substance. And we had two groups who received different doses of insulin. And as you said, they received insulin for four months. And what we saw were significant improvements in memory for the participants who received the lower dose of insulin.\nAnd we also looked for some of our participants at the way the brain was able to use glucose. We know that that is a problem for patients with Alzheimer's disease. And we observed, for the placebo group, their brain used less glucose over time, which is a common pattern in Alzheimer's, whereas, for our insulin-treated folks, they had either no change in their glucose use in their brain or in some areas even an improvement.\nHow do you test someone with mild cognitive impairment? How do you check whether they have improved or at least slowed down in their advance? What tools do you use?\nWell, there are a number of different memory tests that have been developed.\nAnd the test that we used is one of the most sensitive to the very earliest stages of memory loss. It's called a story recall test. And so the participants hear a story that's read to them and then we ask them to tell us back right away all of the details of the story that they have just heard. And then we wait 30 minutes and ask them again to recall all of the details.\nAnd so the amount of information that they're able to hold on to over that 30-minute period is a very good indicator of the state of their memory. And what we observed was that the participants that were treated with the lower dose of insulin were able to remember more details over the 30-minute period after four months of treatment than was the placebo group.\nSo you had this promising initial result in this small group in phase two. Where do you go from here? And how do you ramp up? What are you looking for?\nWell, the next phase is going to be very important.\nWhat we need to do is to administer insulin for a longer period of time than four months. We need to know that this is going to be safe when it's given over a longer period. And we also have some reason to believe that it will be even more effective if it's given for a longer period of time.\nSo that's a very important next step. And our plans are to give it for a year-and-a-half. And then the other aspect of this is that we need to bring this into a larger arena. And we will be proposing a study that will be carried out in many centers across the country, in centers where there are Alzheimer's research centers that are funded by the National Institute of Health.\nAnd so we will be — we will be improving the study in terms of having it be translated into a larger scale and for a longer period of time.\nThere are already millions of people who are taking insulin routinely. Is there anything we can learn from taking a look at them?\nOf course, the people who are taking insulin routinely are folks with diabetes. And we know that diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, that if one has diabetes, one is more likely over one's lifetime to develop Alzheimer's disease. So it's very important for folks with diabetes to control their diabetes well.\nAnd what we have learned is that, if you are able to control your diabetes well, then you are able to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\nStressing again that it is still early",

        "prompt": "For The Irish Times Deal of the Year Award this year, we’ve chosen four major transactions that have either rewarded their owners for years of hard work and risk taking, or could be transformative for the Irish companies in the years ahead.\nDespite the troubling retail environment, the hugely successful Smyth family closed a transaction to see their toy empire almost double in size.\nThe four brothers pick up a nomination for their deal announced in April to buy its rival Toys R Us in Germany, Austria and Switzerland after that company’s central European division went bankrupt.\nThe deal, for an estimated €79 million, added a further 90 stores to the group’s network of 110 outlets located in Ireland and, mostly, the UK. They also took on the company’s head office in Cologne.\nHaving started the business more than 30 years ago, the Smyth family noted at the time of the acquisition that they were “convinced about the future of multi-channel specialist toy retail” and confident that their brand could be grown into continental Europe.\nThe move puts the company amongst the largest specialist toy retail chains in Europe and now more than 40 per cent of its network will be located on the continent.\nTony, Pádraig, Liam and Tom have been here before when they rapidly expanded into the UK and it would appear as though they’ll have no trouble ensuring this particular deal pays off.\nAs sales go, Séamus Mulligan’s disposal of Adapt Pharma was a spectacular one.\nThe deal to sell to US company Emergent saw Mulligan and his fellow investors sharing in a windfall of $635 million (€562 million), the majority of which was in cash.\nEstablished in 2014 with an investment of $115 million, Adapt developed Narcan, a naloxone nasal spray that revives people who have overdosed on opioids. More importantly, however, was that the drug was developed in the midst of an opioid crisis in the US and Narcan was seen as being attractive because of the simplicity with which it could be used.\nPreviously only available as an injection, the nasal spray aspect made it easier for non-medical personnel, like policemen, teachers, family and friends, to help reduce the 72,000 toll of lives lost to overdose in the US alone last year.\nAnd while the deal was extraordinarily lucrative for Mulligan and his colleagues, the reason behind the sale was driven by the desire to expand the drug’s user base. The need for additional capital and resources to maximise the public health benefit was seen as one of the key reasons to sell.\nThe deal in November that caught our eyes was the sale of One4all, the gift voucher business, in a move which valued the company at €100 million.\nFinancial technology specialist Blackhawk Network bought the company in an agreement placing an enterprise value on Gift Voucher Shop – the company behind One4all – in the region of about €100 million. The term “enterprise value” embraces the figure paid for a company along with its liabilities.\nReports last year had suggested the company could sell for more than €60 million.\nThe deal gave both the company’s founder, Michael Dawson, and An Post a significant payout. An Post owned 53 per cent of the business and sold the vouchers through post offices around the Republic.\nFor them, the deal represented a “significant” return, given that they picked up their stake for €9 million in 2009.\nEntrepreneur Michael Dawson was also a benefactor having founded the company in 2002, and growing it steadily to make profits in 2017 alone of €7 million.\nGiven its previous successes, this looks like a good deal for all parties involved.\nState forestry company Coillte’s sale of its stake in four wind farms to Dublin-listed Greencoat Renewables for €136 million was one of last year’s more significant deals. The price is unlikely to be repeated for similar assets, as regulators plan a change in supports offered to green energy projects.\nCoillte sold 50 per cent stakes in wind farms at Raheenleagh, Co Wicklow, Cloosh Valley, Co Galway; and Castlepool, Co Cork, and 25 per cent of Sliab",

She's just going to give a talk in which she's just going to insult all of us,\" Mr Arafeh said.\n\"I don't think insulting Muslims comes under free speech, that's an abuse of freedom of speech.\n\"I'm talking on behalf of 50,000 to 60,000 Muslims in New Zealand who are going to face a very hard time by all the comments she is going to make.\"\nA petition with more than 1500 signatures has also been launched on change.org appealing to the Immigration Minister to deny Lauren Southern entry.\nHowever, Ms Southern, who is a journalist, activist and film-maker, said she should be allowed in.\n\"As soon as there are people who want to shut down free speech and freedom to come and even visit your nation just because of a differing opinion you can tell you've got the bug of progressivism,\" Ms Southern said.\n\"The bug of this almost very totalitarian left-wing ideology which will not end well for you.\"\nShe said herself and Mr Molyneux would talk about a range of issues affecting New Zealand.\n\"Immigration, western culture, the preservation of western culture and largely the infectious liberal or far-left ideologies that are coming and working their way into our media and why they will lead to the economic, social and political fall of our nations.\"\nMs Southern said what she had to say was not hate speech.\n\"[Hate speech] is just a fancy word to describe speech that is unpopular during that day and age,\" she said.\n\"A few hundred years ago, I wouldn't be able to question the divine rule of whatever god is in my land, I wouldn't be allowed to be pro-gay or pro-mixed race marriages, today it's you're not allowed to be anti-mass migration, you're not allowed to question crazy LGBTQ politics.\"\nMassey University far-right expert and pro vice chancellor Paul Spoonley said some of what the pair say was considered hate speech.\n\"Some of the things that Molyneux has said about apartheid being a white survival policy and not a racial supremacist policy and then attacking some of the people who say it is something else … some of the things they say are really quite direct and would be very hateful",

        "prompt": "Cranbury, N.J. – Jan 3, 2017 – The recently completed presidential election in Somaliland was the world’s first to use iris recognition to create a voter registration list and remove duplicate names from the rolls. The iris-based biometric technology, from Iris ID, helped ensure a free and fair election, so important for the autonomous state to gain the international recognition it seeks.\nA 60-member team of international observers, representing 27 countries, certified the November election as free and fair – a change from previous elections in which duplicate registrations led to questions about the legitimacy of the results. Somaliland, located on the Horn of Africa, declared its independence from Somalia in 1991.\n“In a world-first, these elections employed pioneering iris-recognition technology to register and identify voters, which is a testament to Somaliland’s commitment to its resources in democratic institutions and the rule of law,” said the new president, Muse Bihi Abdi, in a column for the Financial Times.\nSomaliland’s National Electoral Commission reported an 80 percent turnout for the election.\nThe NEC spent several years preparing for the vote, including the process of choosing a biometric technology to register citizens. Commission members wanted a system capable of noting those registering more than once. Both fingerprint facial recognition systems failed to recognize many duplicate registrations in the program’s early stages.\nAt the recommendation of international election consultants, the commission tried an iris-based system. In a trial project, the Iris ID technology was able to accurately recognize all 457 instances of duplicates seeded into a base of 1,062 registrations. Experts estimate as many as 30,000 duplicates were identified during the countrywide registration. De-duplication was possible using Iris ID software which compared the high-quality biometric data from the iris scans.\nEnrollment speed also worked in Iris ID’s favor. Roy Dalle Vedove, a prominent international elections specialist and NEC consultant, said the iris-based system was not only more accurate than fingerprint technology, but also cut the time needed to register a voter in half.\nAfter selecting the Iris ID technology, the NEC and purchased 350 portable registration kits consisting of a laptop computer, handheld iris scanner, webcam for facial photos, a flash and tripod. Registration stations were set up across the country – many in remote rural areas. Once approved, citizens received a temporary certificate until their national voter card was processed.\nSomaliland is now set to become a regional powerhouse in the production and deployment of the technological know-how that underpins electronic voting, wrote Calestous Juma in South Africa’s Mail & Guardian",

Trump’s legal team wants to screen off any possibility that their client will incriminate himself in an interview on those subjects. They’re apparently entirely sanguine about the Russia-collusion hypothesis being a dead end, but obstruction is an easier target for wily prosecutors. It doesn’t take much to set up a perjury trap, especially when dealing with a target with a mouth as famously undisciplined as Trump. Taking Comey and Flynn off the table closes off any path to obstruction … which is why Mueller’s not about to buy off on those terms.\nWhich brings us back to Hannity’s question: If it’s so corrupt as to be a “Watergate on the part of the investigators,” why cooperate at all?

        "prompt": "Even if you have home cinema ambitions and deep pockets, there's no denying that projectors are just too cumbersome for many. Optoma's latest pocket-sized LED projector might promise great things for home entertainment in the long run, but for now this second-gen device is just not up to the demands of home cinema.\nIf you're out and about giving business presentations, however, the idea of a genuinely portable projector will appeal, and the mobile phone-sized Pico is initially hugely impressive.\nIts chief attraction isn't its tiny size, but the ability to store 4GB of files on the gadget itself. What other projector - of any size - can do that? What's more, the Optoma claims a huge file compatibility list that doesn't just cover the basics. For images, the Pico plays JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP, TGA, FPX, PCX, PCD and PSD, though it doesn't play any music files despite having a 0.5W speaker.\nOn the video side, the Pico claims to play AVI, WMV, ASF, 3GP, 3G2, DAT, MPG, MPEG, MOV, MP4, M4V, RM, RMVB, OGM and FLV files. However, there's a huge caveat; absolutely everything - including PowerPoint presentations - have to be converted using ArcSoft Media Converter software that's supplied in the projector's memory itself. There's worse news, however - it only works with a PC, not on a Mac. That's unusual these days, and surprising since this product is being sold on Apple's website as a bona fide accessory for Apple products.\nThe Pico does, however, come with a few cables that mean external devices can be manually attached - a messy situation, and the only option for those with Apple devices (even then, a separate MiniDisplay port to VGA adapter and a VGA cable must be bought for Macs, or a separate iPod connection kit). In the box cables are supplied for Composite video, Component video and VGA, so it's possible to attach almost anything; we'd wager the Composite video will be most useful for its compatibility (with the adaptor) for iPhones and iPods, camcorders, laptops, games consoles, DVD players and cameras.\nThere's no doubting the Pico's svelte design; somehow Optoma has packed-in a wheel for operating the menus, a tiny focus wheel and speaker near the lamp, a slot for a tripod - a seemingly essential accessory, though not supplied in the box - and its proprietary VGA/USB slot and minijack AV slot.\nSwitch on the Pico and you're presented with a very simple menu with icons for Video, Pictures and Presentations. Click into each one and a list is presented of all the files, though it's very basic.\nDuring our tests the menus frequently froze. A separate folder dragged into the Photos folder on the Pico refused to display - all files must seemingly be placed \"loose\" on the projector, though its ability to play slideshows might appeal.\nIf you're using an external video source, you can bypass all of this, though it's best to dive into the Settings menu first to make sure the Pico is on full brightness - its Eco setting isn't recommended.\nThe Pico's performance with video is just about",

        "prompt": "AT $42, a nicely charred 16-ounce slab of prime boneless strip loin might not seem like much of a bargain now, but it could soon.\nOver the past two months or so the cost of producing beef and the demand for it have risen so much that prices are soaring and the supply of top quality beef has dropped. Customers at steakhouses and markets will see the effects in coming weeks if they haven’t already.\nThe price of steers ready for slaughter jumped to 98 cents a pound last month from 83 cents a pound in April 2006, according to Urner Barry, a publisher of marketing reports. After slaughtering, transporting and butchering, a restaurant’s cost for a well-trimmed steak may be 30 percent higher, said Bob Mark, director of sales for Buckhead Beef Northeast, in South Plainfield, N.J., a division of Buckhead Beef, a wholesaler based in Atlanta.\nThe last time prices reached those levels was at the end of 2003, but they dropped sharply in early 2004. This time people in the meat business think the increase will be more persistent.\n“The bottom line is that we have to assume that beef prices will not come down any time soon,” said Ephraim Leibtag, an economist who specializes in retail stores and restaurants for the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture.\nMany of the factors pushing up prices are also affecting quality.\nThe demand for ethanol and a harsh winter have caused the price of corn to rise about 60 percent over the past few months. Farmers are planting more corn now, but Mr. Leibtag would not predict a price drop soon.\nThe quality of beef has also been hurt by the stress of a hard winter.\nAdam Perry Lang, the chef at Robert’s Steakhouse in Manhattan, said that some farmers are supplementing corn feed with cheaper wheat and soy, giving the beef less flavor and less marbling.\nIn the past about 2 percent of all beef graded out as prime — the top variety, the most well marbled, with flavorful, tenderizing fat. Some wholesalers think that may have dropped to as low as 0.5 percent. The supply of top levels of choice beef, the next grade, has also shrunk.\nEven if a restaurant says it is serving prime meat, it may not be. If your steak lacks a deep beefiness and is too chewy to be pleasurable, it is probably choice grade. And if no grade is given on the menu, you can be sure it is choice.\nThe shortage of prime beef has led Marilyn Spiera, an owner of Peter Luger Steak House in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to cut back on reservations, close the restaurant earlier each day and book fewer large parties, which she also did the last time beef prices were this high, in 2003. “It’s hitting us worse now,” she said, noting that prime beef that meets her standards is scarcer now. The restaurant recently increased the price of the porterhouse for two, to $81 from $79.90.\nYet demand continues to escalate. The number of steakhouses grows every year. The Zagat Survey of New York restaurants for 2007, for example, lists 80 steakhouses, an increase of about 10 percent from the year before. And after banning American beef for several years because of concerns about mad cow disease, Japan and South Korea are now permitting imports.\nThe Palm steakhouse chain has raised the price of its steaks by $2, and side dishes have gone up 50 cents to help compensate for the price of the beef. “I don’t think our customers have noticed,” said Walter H. McClure, the chief operating officer of the Palm Restaurant Group.\nTom Colicchio, whose lineup at Craftsteak includes grass-fed beef, which is less affected by the cost of corn, said he was thinking about raising prices. Laurent Tourondel, whose BLT restaurants serve hanger and flat iron steaks in addition to the luxury cuts, said he bought all his supplies in January, guaranteeing his price until the end of the year.\nMarc Murphy, an owner of Landmarc, in TriBeCa and in the Time Warner Center, said higher prices and lower quality have not been a problem. But his hanger, skirt, strip loin, fillet and rib-eye are all choice grade.\nMost supermarket shoppers buy choice grade. Mr. Leibtag of the Department of Agriculture said shoppers would soon be affected by rising costs and limited supply. The most recent average retail supermarket prices for choice grade that the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade group based in Chicago, could provide were from March. They reflected an overall 2 percent increase compared with the year before.\nSkirt steak, first popularized for fajitas, now has a wider audience and represents a rich-tasting alternative for home grilling.\nThe h",

        "prompt": "Freshman-Sophomore College (FroSoCo) provides the vibrant and tightly-knit community of a small liberal arts college within a large premier research university. FroSoCo consists of approximately 100 first-year students and 70 sophomores living in two adjoining houses. Admission is by application, and once admitted, students can opt to stay for their sophomore year, making it one of the only places on campus where you can easily return to be with your friends.\nWhat makes FroSoCo unique is its reputation for being especially nerdy (even among the Nerd NationTM) and for strongly encouraging students to “geek out together.” This means three specific things. First, students have and develop a deep enthusiasm in one or many topics, subjects, or domains (be a “geek”). “Deep enthusiasm” doesn't mean being an expert, it just means really getting excited about something! Second, students are proud and free to express this intense interest (i.e. be “out” about their interest). FroSoCo students openly share the ups and the downs of their journey. Third, students “geek out” with other students. Importantly, FroSoCo students “geek out together” about many nerdy things ranging from poetry to politics to programming. There is a playful, hard-working, energy that permeates the house. And while this happens across campus, it is the intensity and sometimes scale with which FroSoCo does this, given the longstanding culture established by the College, that makes it unique.\nJennifer and Scott Calvert (with their sons Van and Rockwell) are the Resident Fellows (RFs) for FroSoCo.\nJenn and Scott met during their time in college when they were on staff together (feel free to “awww”). Scott majored in Neuroscience before getting his Master’s in Film Production and Media Arts. Jennifer got her undergraduate degree in English and started work as a high school teacher for English language learners. She then received her Master’s in Counseling and her PhD in Educational Leadership and Learning Technology. Scott and Jenn have lived and worked in Texas, New Hampshire, and Philadelphia (technically, that last one is not a state, but it’s Philly…it can’t be lumped in with Lancaster). Scott currently works as a video maker, editor and storytelling consultant. Jenn works in Student Affairs at Stanford.\nScott enjoys movies (or “films”—if you’re feeling artsy), comic books (graphic novels), geek collectibles, art, and anything pop culture. Jenn enjoys building things (especially with LEGO), cooking and reading about organizational behavior, education, race, gender and generally anything non-fiction. She’s secretly writing a book. Together they love spending time with friends, finding great places to eat and exploring the world.\nJenn and Scott have discovered that meaningful relationships are both the bedrock and catalysts for their own personal growth and learning. They were indelibly shaped by the relationships they formed in college. In their roles as RFs, it is their hope that they can help create a space where students can form their own meaningful relationships, explore, learn and grow. They look forward to making FroSoCo their home.\nCool is overrated. We're not sure that's the goal. We get to know each other.

Each stakeholder is bound to be impacted by the changes, though in different ways. The employees and clients, in particular, need to fully understand the rationale of these moves.\nMost strategies are top-driven with shareholders and the board setting the direction, and management pushing that agenda throughout the organisation. To be successful, managements must involve the entire organisation in the implementation and with due consideration to the company’s ecosystem, work culture and operating structures. And design appropriate internal and external communication.\nIt is true the life cycle of any strategy roll-out has many parts, between the envisioning, planning, and execution to achieve sustainability. The transformation goals need a definitive preparedness at the enterprise level. Often, critical strategies are pushed with little consideration to the company’s readiness to absorb change.\nDepending on the nature of the move, the company needs to be diligent in its communication for both internal and external. The internal communication focused on employees should gain their endorsement to reduce risks of any downturn in morale or to rule out any miscommunication.\nThe external communication must articulate the rationale and its reach to media and other patrons.\nFor instance, cost-cutting is a standard strategy that impacts employees the most. This plays havoc on the entire corporate ecosystem and if not managed diligently often undermines performance as an adverse reaction. The usual cuts in salaries, perks, and facilities though are standard to company transformations, but these require diligent handling.\nThese moves must be followed through by tactical engagement with each group impacted by the measures. The top leadership must lead the engagement, not just the HR division, to explain the rationale of any cost-cutting strategy as these must be aligned with the overall good of a company. In this message, the right of all must be highlighted and percolate down to the entire organisation.\nThe shared goal of no pain, no gain must be well articulated. In case of a company’s downsizing, employee morale nosedives and which can fuel job insecurity through the entire organisation as well as pose a trust deficit with clients too if the transition process is not managed.\nChanges such as management restructuring must not be envisaged without engaging clients and employees.

        "prompt": "In 2005, the San Jose (Calif.) Police Department transitioned from a complex Aikido-based Arrest and Control program to a simple Defense and Arrest Tactics system grounded in functional tactics, concepts, and principles. The old method failed to teach self-defense or combative skills other than with the baton, while the new system borrowed extensively from other contemporary police DT systems, and incorporated the science of motor-skill learning to the instructional process. Local academies in the South Bay area soon followed suit and adopted the new program.\nAs the developer and lead instructor of the new system, I was often asked by Field Training Officers (FTO) how they could evaluate a recruit schooled in a program different from that in which they were trained. Some used their “lack of knowledge” of the new system as an excuse to avoid rating the recruit in this competency. Some had an allegiance to the old system and therefore declined to attend any training offered by me and my co-instructors on the new program. Most, however welcomed the change and solicited suggestions as to how they could evaluate a recruit in the field when he or she employed, for instance a handcuffing process different from what they were taught.\nThe first and most obvious answer to the problem of technique unfamiliarity is for the FTO to get together with the department’s DT instructor and learn the new system. While this may sound burdensome, FTOs are (or should be) experienced officers with skills of their own, and if the new system is based upon simple skills the FTO should have little difficulty picking up on the different techniques. Remember, a wrist-lock is a wrist-lock, an interview stance is an interview stance, and as far as a baton strike goes... well, there are only so many ways to swing a stick.\nFor those FTOs who, like many departments these days are seeing more lateral officers who have been trained in a system taught by another agency, the problem may be more pronounced. However, before you throw up your hands, talk to your agency’s DT instructor. It is very likely that he or she has stayed on top of the trends in subject control and may be familiar with the skills taught by the other system. If this is not the case, do not despair.\nFirst, take time to get on the mat with your new trainee and learn what he has in his repertoire. I strongly suggest that the FTO approach this with an open mind and a willingness to learn rather than adopting the attitude of, “Let me show you what I know because this is what we do here.” You may actually learn something new that you like more- and in which you wish to take the time to become proficient. And, this trainee is likely set in his pattern of action — trying to get him to unlearn something in which he is already proficient can lead to performance errors at critical times.\nNext, do your job as an FTO and pay close attention to field performance. Especially attend to those aspects of subject contact and control that lead to officer injury and death. Specific technique rarely impacts the degree of risk that an officer faces during an arrest situation. More often, officers are attacked and injured because they failed to pick up on the cues presented by the suspect, or they placed themselves in a vulnerable position without adequate time to react.\nInstead of criticizing and getting into a “my kung fu is better than your kung fu” conflict over how a trainee applied handcuffs to a subject, evaluate his avenue of approach and his position of advantage (although those of you who know me know that I don’t believe there is such a thing as a “position of advantage” — there is only a position of “less disadvantage” to you and “less advantage” for the suspect, but that is a topic for another time). Does the trainee make appropriate use of “cover” in all its applications (noun- using barriers that protects against threats; verb- reasonably pointing a weapon at identified threats; adjective- efficiently and effectively acting as backup for fellow officers)? Does he control his distance from the threat and successfully position a subject and his cohorts as the environment dictates?\nIs the trainee following the “tactical M&Ms,” — Maximizing advantage, minimizing exposure, and maintaining the ability to maneuver — while initiating field contacts and responding to calls for service? Is he aware of noise and light discipline while making covert approaches or conducting building searches. Some may ask what these tactics have to do with subject control training. Remember, everything you do (perceive-sense-respond), has everything to do (human factors: reaction time, stress, decision making, memory, etc.), with all that you do (tasks that we perform). It is all about training the mind how to recognize common patterns (schemas) and developing consistent solutions to the problems presented across distinct scenarios.\nDoes your trainee maintain emotional control and demonstrate “command presence” so that he presents himself as a formidable opponent to the suspect who is evaluating whether or not to “give it a go?” Remember, FBI research has identified and interviewed felons who killed one law enforcement officer only after having passed on an attempt with another officer because that officer presented a “tough target” demeanor. When going “hands on” with an individual, does the trainee first scan for threats (hands, waistband, pockets, head-to-toe, surrounding areas) when time allows? Does he make an effort to control both of the subject’s hands? Does he handcuff early when it is reasonable to do so? And, does he conduct a complete and thorough search?\nDo you insist on an answer to the following questions?\n• Do you search first or handcuff first?\n• Do the hands go behind the head or behind the back?\n• Do you cuff the controlled hand or the uncontrolled hand first or do you do a “dual-hand grip” handcuff application?\nIf, however you find yourself in the rare situation where the tactics and techniques that you observe your trainee employ are such an obvious violation of sound common sense practices, then you are probably honor-bound to take corrective action and provide re-training before someone gets injured. Before you do however, notify your chain of command and get",

        "prompt": "Emulators for playing older games are immensely popular online, with regular arguments breaking out over which emulator is best for which game. Today we present another point of view from a gentleman who has created the Super Nintendo emulator bsnes. He wants to share his thoughts on the most important part of the emulation experience: accuracy.\nIt doesn't take much raw power to play Nintendo or SNES games on a modern PC; emulators could do it in the 1990s with a mere 25MHz of processing power. But emulating those old consoles accurately—well, that's another challenge entirely; accurate emulators may need up to 3GHz of power to faithfully recreate aging tech. In this piece we'll take a look at why accuracy is so important for emulators and why it's so hard to achieve.\nPut simply, accuracy is the measure of how well emulation software mimics the original hardware. Apparent compatibility is the most obvious measure of accuracy—will an old game run on my new emulator?—but such a narrow view can paper over many small problems. In truth, most software runs with great tolerance to timing issues and appears to be functioning normally even if timing is off by as much as 20 percent.\nSo the question becomes: if we can achieve basic compatibility, why care about improving accuracy further when such improvement comes at a great cost in speed? Two reasons: performance and preservation.\nFirst, performance. Let's take the case of Speedy Gonzales. This is an SNES platformer with no save functionality, and it's roughly 2-3 hours long. At first glance, it appears to run fine in any emulator. Yet once you reach stage 6-1, you can quickly spot the difference between an accurate emulator and a fast one: there is a switch, required to complete the level, where the game will deadlock if a rare hardware edge case is not emulated. One can imagine the frustration of instantly losing three hours of progress and being met with an unbeatable game. Unless the software does everything in the exact same way the hardware used to, the game remains broken.\nOr consider Air Strike Patrol, where a shadow is drawn under your aircraft. This is done using mid-scanline raster effects, which are extraordinarily resource intensive to emulate. But without the raster effects, your aircraft's shadow will not show up, as you see in the screenshot below. It's easy to overlook, especially if you do not know that it is supposed to be there. But once you actually see it, you realize that it's quite helpful. Your aircraft has the ability to drop bombs, and this shadow acts as a sort of targeting system to determine where they will land.—something that's slightly more difficult without this seemingly minor effect.\nThe second issue is preservation. Take a look at Nintendo's Game & Watch hardware. These devices debuted in 1980, and by now most of the 43 million produced have failed due to age or have been destroyed. Although they are still relatively obtainable, their scarcity will only increase, as no additional units will ever be produced. This same problem extends to any hardware: once it's gone, it's gone for good. At that point, emulators are the only way to experience those old games, so they should be capable of doing so accurately.\nThere's nothing wrong with less accurate but speedy emulators, and such code can run on lower-powered hardware like cell phones and handheld gaming devices. These emulators are also more suited for use on laptops where battery life is a concern. But there's something to be said for chasing accuracy, too, and it's what I've attempted to do in my own work. Here's why it matters to me.\nBack in the late '90s, Nesticle was easily the NES emulator of choice, with system requirements of roughly 25MHz. This performance came at a significant cost: game images were hacked to run on this emulator specifically. Fan-made translations and hacks relied on emulation quirks that rendered games unplayable on both real hardware and on other emulators, creating a sort of lock-in effect that took a long while to break. At the time, people didn't care about how the games originally looked and played in general, they just cared about how they looked and played in this arbitrary and artificial environment.\nThese days, the most dominant emulators are Nestopia and Nintendulator, requiring 800MHz and 1.6GHz, respectively, to attain full speed. The need for speed isn't because the emulators aren't well optimized: it's because they are a far more faithful recreation of the original NES hardware in software.\nNow compare these to the older N64 emulator, UltraHLE, whose system requirements were a meager 350MHz Pentium II system. To the casual observer, it can be quite perplexing to see Mario 64 requiring less processing power than the original Mario Bros.\nMy experience in emulation is in the SNES field, working on the bsnes emulator. I adored the ideal behind Nestopia, and wanted to recreate this level of accuracy for the Super Nintendo. As it turns out, the same level of dedication to accuracy pushed requirements up into the 2-3GHz range, depending on the title.\nNestopia caught on because its system requirements were paltry for its time, but I have no doubt that releasing it in 1997 would have been disastrous. Since my emulator ultimately required a computing system with more power than half the market, I've seen first-hand the effect of high system specs and the backlash it causes. It's easier to blame the program than to admit your computer isn't powerful enough, but the reality is that faking an entire gaming console in software is an intensive process.\nSo if an emulator appears to run all games correctly, why should we then improve upon it? The simple answer is because it improves the things we don't yet know about. This is particularly prominent in less popular software.\nAs an example, compare the spinning triforce animation from the opening to Legend of Zelda on the ZSNES and bsnes emulators. On the former, the triforces will complete their rotations far too soon as a result of the CPU running well over 40 percent faster than a real SNES. These are little details, but if you have an eye for accuracy, they can be maddening.\nI've encountered dozens of titles with obscure quirks. Sometimes the correct, more accurate emulation actually produces a \"wrong\" result. Super Bonk's attract mode demo actually desynchronizes, causing Bonk to get stuck near a wall on most real systems. And Starfox suffers from significant slowdown issues throughout the game. These are certainly not desirable attributes, but they are correct nonetheless. We wouldn't round pi down to 3 simply because irrational numbers are inconvenient, right?\nI don't deny the advantages of treating classic games as something that can be improved upon: N64 emulators employ stunning high-resolution texture packs and 1080p upscaling, while SNES emulators often provide 2x anti-aliasing for Mode7 graphics and cubic-spline interpolation for audio samples. Such emulated games look and sound better. While there is nothing wrong with this, it is contrary to the goal of writing a hardware-accurate emulator. These improvement techniques typically make it more difficult even to allow for the option of accurate emulation, in fact.\nAnother major area where accuracy is a benefit is in fan-created works from translators, ROM hackers, and homebrew developers. Few of them have access to run code on real hardware, so they will often develop their software using emulators. Unfortunately, speed-oriented emulators will often ignore hardware limitations. This is never a problem for a commercially developed game: upon required testing on real hardware, the bug would quickly be discovered and fixed. But if you can only test on a specific emulator, such bugs tend to persist.\nI can name a few examples. The fan translations for Dragon Quest 1&2, Dual Orb 2, Sailor Moon: Another Story and Ys 4 all suffered invisible text issues as a result of writing to video RAM while the video processor had it locked out for rendering the screen. Only half of these titles have subsequently been fixed.\nWe've known about this hardware limitation since 1997, which consists of a one-",

There will be 22,000 or thereabouts in the Marriott Center when the Zags come to town. That’s going to be a high-energy game, and BYU has had a bit of success against Gonzaga over the past few years.\nWHILE ALL that’s going on, San Francisco has a breather at home against Portland, then a tricky road trip to San Diego.\nBut remember we said two weeks.\nDuring the first few days of February, the Zags get San Diego at home and then the rematch with San Francisco.\nThe Dons will arrive at The Kennel off a bloodthirsty road test at longtime rival St. Mary’s — where the Gaels finally seem to have come to life.\nHow all these games play out over the next two weeks will decide not only whether the Zags are going to win in a stroll, but if we might see chaos in those 2-3-4 spots.\nAs proof of how weird the schedule looks, San Francisco and St. Mary’s will be facing each other for the second time in three weeks.\nHaving gone over all of these future proceedings, however. the key for Gonzaga is simply to keep winning.\nThe Santa Clara-BYU road trip would be a nice one to survive intact.\nThere’s no question now about Gonzaga having reached elite status in college basketball.\nHey, North Carolina is coming to The Kennel.\nWhat other proof do you need?\nWell, how about grabbing a big trophy for national player of the year?\nGranted, it might be difficult with Duke monster Zion Williamson stomping through the ACC.\nVoter these days also go by some pretty esoteric advanced metrics, numbers that suggest — leaving SportsCenter dunks out of the equation — how valuable players are to their teams.\nIF YOU follow college hoops seriously, you know Ken Pomeroy (kenpom.com), who either invented some of these metrics and ratings, or knows how to use them better than anyone else.\nRight, we’ve established that in voting for this year’s POY (Player of the Year), Williamson is an imposing figure.\nWell, he’s an imposing figure in any situation, but you get what I mean.\nAnd yet, Gonzaga boasts a star whose numbers are insanely close to Zion’s.\nIt shouldn’t surprise you that the Zags would have a POY candidate.\n“It would be an extremely difficult call for me between Williamson and Clarke,” Hamilton said. “To be clear, everyone on your list merits consideration. I really thought going into this process that I’d land on someone other than Zion.\nBut what about all those advanced metrics?\n“The great and very confusing part about college basketball is that we have all these stats to measure how important and valuable guys are to their team,” Hamilton said.",

        "prompt": "1 What Are the Social Responsibilities of a Company to Its Stakeholders?\n2 What Are Ethical Responsibilities in an Organization?\nWhether you run a company that sells widgets, windmills, or wine tasting services, you have many responsibilities that extend beyond making money and paying bills. Ethical business conduct is a moral imperative for your organization, and it may be required by law. Your obligations are likely to vary, however, depending upon which stakeholders you consider.\nStakeholders can be any person or organization that has a vested interest in what your business does. Employees, customers, shareholders, board members, and even members of the community, can all be affected by what you and your organization does. Your responsibilities to each will vary.\nAs an employer, you have a moral obligation to offer your employees fair pay and reasonable work expectations, while also providing a safe work environment. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration outlines specific rules about workplace safety, while the Americans with Disabilities Act explains the accommodations you must provide to those who have disabilities. Beyond the basics, though, you should have a way for your employees to address grievances in the workplace. Even if you don’t have a formal HR Department, you’ll want to have someone in charge of making sure that employees are treated fairly and with respect.\nYou may also want to have a communication channel that keeps employees informed. Whether your organization is growing or is facing likely layoffs, the ethically moral thing to do is to let your employees know so they don’t feel blindsided. Set up quarterly meetings to keep everyone informed of what's happening and answer questions in a forthright manner. If things aren't going well, let your employees know how you might assist them, such as offering worker retraining or providing career services.\nProviding your customers with good quality at a fair price is both an ethically and financially responsible path. Whatever product or service you produce, you should give your customers what you promise. There are many recent examples of companies doing quite the opposite, whether it’s for-profit schools using unscrupulous marketing tactics and promising larger-than-life results from the diplomas they offer or Wells Fargo and similar companies committing outright fraud by creating false accounts. Be honest, be fair. And your customers will reward you with purchases and brand loyalty.\nIf you’ve ever worked for a large, publicly traded company, you already understand the ethical requirements from governmental bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. But even if your business has no shareholders, you may have a board of director or an advisory board. Maybe your “board” is only a single person who loaned you the money to start your dream business.\nYour ethical responsibilities are clear. Be honest about how the business is doing.

Or maybe not.\nOn Thursday morning, the U.S. Commerce Department said the nation’s gross domestic product rose 2.5% in the third quarter, nearly double the 1.3% rate it had risen in the quarter before. And the growth was far better than many economists thought it would be just a few months ago. In the doldrums of the mid-summer many people were predicting that the economy would soon slide back into recession. That doesn’t seem to be happening, at least for now.\nEven more encouraging was where the growth came from – corporate America. There was a huge surge in business spending, up more than 17%. Consumer spending was up as well, but not nearly as much. Of note, though, is that consumer spending rose faster than incomes. That’s not a great thing on an individual level. Savings was down. But for the economy in the short-term it’s a good sign. Consumers appear to be regaining some measure of optimism. And in a consumer driven economy we need confidence.\nStill, for a number of economists today’s news wasn’t enough wipe away their general pessimism about the economy. Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said the growth was temporary and would soon fade. Nigal Gault at IHS Global Insight said the most likely outlook for the U.S. is continued weak growth. Josh Bivens of the think tank the Economic Policy Institute said that “the strongest growth in a year was still not strong enough.” NBER economist Justin Wolfers said the recovery has been delayed another quarter.\nWhat are all these economists so worried about?\nAgain, it comes back to corporate spending. A number said the surge in business spending was not sustainable. Corporations, though, are sitting on hoards of cash. It was often cited as the reason the economy would pull out of recession. In fact, a common question during the recession has been why aren’t companies spending more. Now that businesses are finally spending I don’t get why people believe it will stop so quickly.

An average audience of 13.2 million viewers tuned into PBS member stations for “Downton Abbey, Season 4,” reinforcing its status as PBS’ highest-rated drama in history (and up from 11.5 million viewers for Season 3). The average audience for “Sherlock, Season 3” grew to 6.6 million viewers in its new 10 p.m. timeslot — up from 4.4 million viewers in Season 2.\nSunday nights continue to grow for PBS stations with Sunday average primetime household ratings up 30 percent since the 2012-2013 season. A strong lineup of British dramas continues throughout the spring, including the premieres of CALL THE MIDWIFE (Season 3), MASTERPIECE “Mr. Selfridge, Season 2” on March 30 and THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE (Season 2) on April 13.\nThe fourth season of “Downton Abbey, ” a Carnival Films/MASTERPIECE co-production, is now the highest-rated drama in PBS history, outperforming the drama’s record-breaking third season for the top spot. Per Nielsen, the eight-week season earned an average national household rating of 8.5 — up from Season 3’s 7.7 national household rating — and 26 million viewers tuned in over the course of the season.\nAccording to Social Guide Intelligence, on Sunday nights across its run, “Downton” generated more than 280,000 tweets and more than 35.6 million impressions while facing stiff social media competition, including the Golden Globes, the Olympics and Super Bowl XLVIII.\nNumbers for “Sherlock” were dynamic across its third season, with an average audience dramatically higher than the PBS average audience in the 10:00-11:30 p.m. timeslot. The third season of the drama, a Hartswood Films Production for BBC/Cymru Wales co-produced with MASTERPIECE and distributed by BBC Worldwide, improved upon the second season in all areas, notably in its 4.1 national household rating, which was a 46 percent increase from a 2.8 rating for Season 2. The average audience improved 50 percent to 6.6 million, and the 13.5 million total viewers reached increased 26 percent from 10.7 million in 2012.\nOn Sundays across its three-week run, “Sherlock” fans produced more than 58,000 tweets and generated nearly 4 million impressions against programming including the Grammy Awards, NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl XLVIII.

A group of 40 students and 13 adults traveled from Lancaster, Pa., to give hurricane-stricken Long Beach and Pass Christian high schools something they didn't expect this year—a homecoming dance.\nBlack and silver stars hung from the ceiling, and movie posters covered the walls. Balloons were tied to the basketball nets.

        "prompt": "Janelle Monáe is on her third, maybe fourth life, a striking fact given that she’s been an avowed futurist from the very start. For almost a decade, she’s been treating R&B and funk as technologies badly in need of updating, planning for their cyborg future and waiting for everyone else to catch up.\nBut in the same way that hip-hop is able to manifest its politics without overtness, much of the music Ms. Monáe has been fiddling with is also comfortably next-wave without advertising itself as such. In this environment, Ms. Monáe’s sleek eccentricity has often felt overwrought, or at minimum, inessential.\nWhich is perhaps why, over the last few months, Ms. Monáe has retreated to the present, or sometimes, to the past. Her thumping, au courant single “Yoga” was the first song on which she was the lead artist to crack the Billboard Hot 100. That song features a protégé, the rapper and singer Jidenna, who has an actual breakout pop-rap hit, the dandy theme song “Classic Man,” which takes Ms. Monáe’s tomorrow template and applies it to preaching the benefits of yesteryear.\nThey can both be found on “Wondaland Presents: The Eephus” (Wondaland/Epic), the spotty compilation from Ms. Monáe’s Wondaland label that was released on Friday. (Eephus is a reference to that unpredictable, often unhittable baseball pitch.) On Thursday night, the whole Wondaland massive — Ms. Monáe, Jidenna, Roman GianArthur, the funk-rock duo Deep Cotton and the acoustic soul duo St. Beauty — convened at the Highline Ballroom for a group show, artists flowing on and off stage, in and out of one another’s sets.\nThe concert, like the EP, showed a crew brimming with ideas, though often with execution falling short of the aesthetic. Onstage Ms. Monáe is a lightning bolt, vibrating at a unique frequency. Here, in a white jumpsuit with black accents, her hair in a pouf jumping out atop her head, she delivered old songs like “Tightrope” and “Electric Lady” with church fervor.\n“Yoga,” though, is vexing. It’s a glamour hippie celebration, and also a strip-club ready anthem, with one showstopping line that functions in either setting: “You cannot police me/ So get off my areola.” Perhaps Ms. Monáe is winking, trying to camouflage herself with this song, which sounds as if it was written for Beyoncé’s last album — or worse, immediately in its wake.\nFor continuity, there was a band playing throughout the concert, with varying degrees of intensity, though in part it had the unintended effect of smoothing out the differences among the artists. In addition to Ms. Monáe and Jidenna, there was the rowdy, fun and unfocused Deep Cotton; the shamanistic, meditative and slightly stern St. Beauty (who performed a dry cover of Sheryl Crow’s “Strong Enough”); and Mr. GianArthur, a good singer and better guitar player.\nJidenna has made politics central to his mission, though not exactly in the same way. In the “Classic Man” video, there is an awkward segment in which Jidenna sees some young men being rousted by cops, intervenes on their behalf, then brings them to a kind of gentleman academy, in what feels like a dose of respectability politics incarnate.\nBefore he found",

OpenEye Scientific Software leveraged Riverbed SteelConnect to very quickly and easily establish secure connections to and between AWS VPCs, saving hours of network administration time.\nEnterprises grapple with a host of challenges that are spurring the creation of hybrid clouds: collections of computing infrastructure spread across multiple data centers and multiple cloud providers. This new concept often provokes uncertainty, which must be addressed head on. As more applications and computing resources move to the cloud, enterprises will become more dependent on cloud vendors, whether the issue is access, hosting, management, or any number of other services. Cloud consumers want to avoid vendor lock-in—having only one cloud provider. They want to know that they will have visibility into data and systems across multiple platforms and providers. They want to be able to move servers and storage around without a negative impact on application availability.\nIn today’s technology-rich world, customers and employees demand the highest level of application performance. Failure to provide access to applications that consistently perform well anytime, anywhere, and on any device, often leads to lower productivity, customer dissatisfaction, decreased revenue and market share, and damage to brand reputation. This paper explores the challenges that today’s CIOs face in regard to application performance, and how a more strategic data center approach, like distributing applications closer to your users, can help optimize application performance and reduce IT costs.\nWhat’s driving all of the current movement to the cloud? CIOs are charged with adapting quickly to a constantly changing business landscape—while increasing productivity and lowering costs. At the same time, multiple technological trends are coming together to produce an environment in which using cloud resources makes the most sense for many businesses.\nThe businesses that thrive amid fluctuating technology demands are not only keeping a finger on the pulse of current trends, they have the infrastructure in place to handle whatever changes might come. And they’re doing so by treating their data centers as a strategic asset—a hub from which providers and performance can all stem. Are you ready for what’s next? According to analyst forecasts and IT executives, the five key trends affecting our state of technology are mobility, consumer technology, cloud services, hyperdigitization and globalization. In the following pages, you’ll learn how these bgtrends are affecting current networks, and why a strategic data center is key to not only surviving, but thriving, today and in the future.\nLightower's Limitless Network–The Center Of Everything From Finance To Healthcare, To Media to More.\n\"In today",

Scores of innocent people who came to this country in the hope of bettering their lot have been deprived of their hard-won livelihoods simply because they were born elsewhere. South Africans should be outraged and profoundly ashamed about this. However, if anything, the response from the street has been to somehow try to justify the attacks. Going by the comments on late night radio talk shows, engrained beliefs about foreigner establishments undercutting local businesses, being fronts for drug peddling, failing to pay taxes, not employing locally-born South Africans and the like continue to be widely held.\nIt has hardly helped that certain people in authority have sought to play down what has happened and tried to depict the looting as being simply criminally motivated. If that were the case, then all businesses, and not just those belonging to foreign nationals, would have been targeted. These were hate crimes, and issuing mendacious denials of the fact simply adds insult to injury.\nThe latest xenophobia outrages have come shortly in the wake of the Zelda le Grange Twitter controversy. Considerable fury was generated by Le Grange having tweeted — what exactly? Essentially, she was expressing resentment over comments that, in her view, suggested that government regarded whites as being unwelcome in South Africa. At worst, it could be seen as a “Vintage White Whine”, in which the writer read too much into what were a few isolated incidents and overreacted accordingly. Adjudging the tweets to be “racist”, however, was nonsense. Such thinking only creates the ridiculous situation where any complaint (justified or not) about discrimination against whites is automatically construed as being motivated by racism against blacks.\nNo-one was harmed by the tweets, nor, in reality, should they have resulted in much more than a little annoyance. Instead, there was an upsurge of countrywide outrage, culminating in Le Grange’s issuing a rather grovelling apology. By contrast, the kind of moral outrage that one would expect",

I had attended many Bills games years ago, but this was different. The young fans seemed hopeless, yet searching for hope.\nMy father had owned season tickets to the Buffalo Bills for about 20 years after the opening of Rich Stadium in 1973, and I often attended games with him. My parents were accomplished tailgaters who welcomed friends to celebrate at their camper. The joyful pregame atmosphere was accented by people tossing footballs, blaring music, red and blue everything and the tantalizing smell of grilled meats.\nBut it was different this time, many years later. Everywhere we looked, my 18-year-old son, my brother, and I saw drunken youth and the crude expressions of their woozy state of mind.\n\"I hope you get raped!\" yelled a 20-something woman to another 20-something female who was wearing a Jets jersey.\nThirty yards away, a drunken, bare-chested, obese young man stood on the bed of a flatbed truck waving a giant Bills flag with his right hand while downing yet another beer with his left hand at 10:30 a.m. He was accompanied by a friend wearing a Bills jersey waving an equally large American flag.After having a few bowls of our host's special chili, we made our way to the stadium surrounded by throngs of young people in a drunken stupor.We took our seats in the upper deck. Again, omnipresent drunkenness. I spoke with a happy young couple with glazed-over eyes throughout the game. Another pleasant young couple cheering for the Jets was comfortably numb for four quarters. Later in the game, another disturbance broke out. A man with the bloodiest face I've ever seen emerged from the crowd escorted by Bills security.\nThere was one moment that reminded me of the old days. At the beginning of the game, members of the military unrolled an American flag that covered the entire football field and everyone stood to sing the National Anthem respectfully, almost reverently.\nLater, the Buffalo Bills cheerleaders performed a dance number wearing military boots, camouflage pants, and skintight black shirts.

He also upped his career record against St. Louis to 7-2, and is 4-0 in six career road starts against the Cardinals with an earned run average of 2.07.\n\"I didn't know that,\" he said of his career success in St. Louis. \"I just go out there and compete, try to keep my team in the game.\"\nPittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle was asked what Liriano likes about pitching in the Cardinals' spacious ballpark.\n\"Obviously, he likes a lot about this place,\" Hurdle said. \"His fastball played so well, especially later in the game. His pitch efficiency, command, good rhythm ... he gave us the kind of start we needed.\"\nLiriano picked up 12 outs on only 38 pitches from the third through sixth innings, and never seemed in any danger until a weird sequence in the bottom of the seventh enabled the Cardinals to climb back into contention.\nWith Randal Grichuk at second and Aledmys Diaz at first and pinch-hitter Ruben Tejada hitting, Liriano spiked a pitch about 10 feet in front of catcher Francisco Cervelli and the ball bounced almost to the St. Louis dugout behind first base.\nGrichuk was able to score from second, using a headfirst slide to maneuver around Liriano's tag attempt at the plate, and Diaz made third. Tejada's sacrifice fly three pitches later drew the Cardinals within 3-2.\nBut Jung Ho Kang, playing his first game of the year with the Pirates (16-13) after completing a 13-game rehab assignment for Triple-A Indianapolis, cranked out his second homer in the eighth off the third deck's facing in left field for a valuable insurance run.\nIn his previous at-bat, Kang gave Pittsburgh a 3-0 advantage by ambushing a first-pitch fastball from reliever Tyler Lyons for a two-run blast into the St. Louis bullpen. It was the second two-homer game in Kang's career.\nKang hit just .150 in 40 at-bats on his rehab stint, but Hurdle wasn't surprised that he was such a factor against major league pitching.\n\"I've seen it before,\" Hurdle said. \"A guy named (George) Brett, when we didn't have rehab (assignments), he went 4-for-4 with a homer. A lot of people like to place limitations on a player. You never know what's going to happen. We're going to plug him in and let him go.\"\nKang's first two at-bats resulted in first-pitch outs, including a fourth-inning pop-up with the bases loaded that was the last out Cardinals starter Carlos Martinez (4-2) notched.\nAs he threw ball one to the next hitter, Josh Harrison, Martinez bent over in front of the mound. Players went over to check on him, followed by the trainer and manager Mike Matheny. Martinez departed the mound moments later due to fatigue.\nMartinez was feeling under the weather during a 6 2/3-inning start Sunday against Washington and took it easy during his four days between outings.\n\"I felt like I'd make the start with full strength,\" he said through an interpreter, \"but obviously not.\"\nMartinez lasted 3 1/3 innings, giving up three hits and a run with three walks and two strikeouts.

The German electronics and engineering group acquired American oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand in a $7.6 billion deal in September.\n\"We are not in here for a quarter, we are not in for short-term aspects of the oil price, we do believe this is a good space to be because we can bring the expertise from automation and electrification into the oil and gas space so we feel very comfortable in what we see,\" Kaeser said.\nHis comments came as the company reported net income of 1.095 billion euros ($1.22 billion) in the first quarter, down from 1.457 billion euros in 2014, as its power and gas unit was hit by a weaker global economy and oil price. Profit at the unit fell 39 percent in the first three months of the year.\nShares of Siemens were 2.4 percent Tuesday morning.\nBut Kaeser told CNBC that he was optimistic that a lower oil price would provide additional opportunities.\n\"If the oil price is down that certainly will boost sentiment with lower gas prices at the pump so this will give a positive impact into the automotive industry,\" he said.\n\"We also believe that oil importing countries, such as emerging markets will massively benefit from a lower oil price bill and that will go into the infrastructure build-up in those countries.

        "prompt": "The next President of the United States will enter office facing as daunting and diverse a set of foreign policy challenges as any President in recent times: Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea; an unpredictable nuclearized North Korea; Russian belligerence in neighboring nations and renewed influence in the Middle East; Iranian hegemonic ambitions; dangerous and powerful Islamist terror groups, such as ISIS and a host of al-Qaeda affilates; instability in Syria and Libya, with the resulting refugee crises impacting not only neighboring countries, but wide swaths of Europe; rising instability and Islamist terrorism in Africa accompanied by eroding adherence to democracy; economic instability and major corruption in Venezuela; rampant criminality in Mexico; global intelligence espionage; and an ongoing economic malaise in major European economies and Japan. All of these challenges and more will confront America’s next Commander in Chief literally on day one.\nThe State Department seems to lurch from disaster to distraction, responding to many crises but preventing few. Its influence in Washington, and American diplomatic influence globally, is waning….\nWith the rise of large, permanent defense and intelligence bureaucracies after World War II, and the more recent increase in size and stature of the National Security Council begun under Henry Kissinger and expanded since, State’s role is ever more constrained. Its regional and thematic policy experts are often muscled out of big decisions by other parts of the executive branch.\nOnly if the State Department’s internal weaknesses are cured will it become an effective leader in the making and implementation of the nation’s foreign policy. Only then can it credibly seek significant funding increases from Congress. The department suffers in particular from an ineffective organizational structure in which regional and functional policies do not serve integrated goals, and in which sound management, accountability, and leadership are lacking. For this and other reasons, the power to determine national security policy has steadily migrated toward the National Security Council (NSC) staff.\nToo often, those lamenting the problems in the Department of State attribute it primarily to a lack of resources. But Congress and the Bush and Obama Administrations have provided the State Department with significantly more resources in the 15 years since the Hart–Rudman Commission. Both in terms of budget and personnel, State is better resourced than was the case at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, during the mid-1990s, or at the end of the Cold War. Yet, the perception of State Department inadequacy remains, and indicates that the Hart–Rudman Commission was right to conclude that simply increasing resources will not address concerns about the impact, focus, and efficiency of the Department of State. Deficiencies in influence, responsiveness, and effectiveness in the State Department have to be addressed through improved leadership, structure, and organization, and clarity of mission.\nI guarantee you more than 50 percent of the history of this era is going to be written out of that 1 percent and the issues we confront in that 1 percent. And I ask you to think about that as you contemplate the budgets. Because we’ve been robbing Peter to pay Paul.... We’ve been diminishing our capacity to be able to have the kind of impact we ought to be having in this more complicated world.\nThis budgetary argument is a red herring. Adequate or inadequate funding of the State Department has nothing to do with spending on other departments or programs. Arguments can be made that more funding is necessary to meet certain goals or to sustain current operations, but this has nothing to do with overall federal spending except in the obvious context that resources are finite.\nA more useful metric is whether the State Department is receiving more or less funding than it has previously. Analysis of budget data trends indicates that current State Department funding is considerably higher than in previous years.\nEven with the slight decline in recent years due to sequestration, funding for the total International Affairs budget—the overall 150 account which funds the State Department; foreign information and exchange services; international financial programs; and most humanitarian, economic, and security assistance—was 92.6 percent higher than in fiscal year (FY) 2005 (60 percent in constant 2009 dollars); 146.9 percent higher than in FY 1995 (68.7 percent in constant 2009 dollars); and 236.4 percent higher than in FY 1990 at the end of the Cold War (102.8 percent in constant 2009 dollars).\nLikewise, Conduct of Foreign Affairs—the part of the budget that funds the costs and operations of the Department of State—was 46.7 percent higher in FY 2015 than in FY 2005 (21.9 percent in constant 2009 dollars); 250.6 percent higher than in FY 1995 (139.6 percent in constant 2009 dollars); and 386.1 percent higher than in FY 1990 at the end of the Cold War (193.1 percent in constant 2009 dollars).\nThere is also a common perception that the State Department is understaffed, which inhibits its performance, and requires hiring more Foreign Service and Civil Service employees. Foreign Service and Civil Service employees at the State Department do valuable and serious work, including shaping and implementing America’s foreign policy, engaging in diplomatic relations and negotiations, processing visas, and offering day-to-day support of Americans abroad. These employees are essential, and U.S. foreign policy depends on sufficient trained personnel. However, the data clearly indicate that personnel levels in the State Department have grown significantly over the past two decades.\nAccording to the FY 2016 Congressional Budget Justification, the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) employ more than 72,000 people in the U.S., and 280 missions and facilities in nearly every country in the world. A large number of these employees are locally employed staff, including Foreign Service Nationals, but, as illustrated in Chart 2, the number of core staff that manages and fulfills the responsibilities of the State Department—Foreign Service and Civil Service employees—has significantly increased. In fact, total employment of those two employee categories has risen by more than 87 percent between 1995 and 2015.\nIn summary, the data indicate that the State Department has significantly more resources at its disposal than was the case at the end of the Cold War, in the mid-1990s, and at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The deficiencies of the State Department cannot be attributed to shrinking or static resources. The reason for the perceived failings and ineffectiveness of the State Department, instead, lie elsewhere. While poor leadership and misguided policies can obviously impede even the best organizations, consideration must also be given to how existing and expanded resources have been allocated—particularly the expansion of the State Department’s focus beyond its traditional remit and the emphasis on those non-traditional responsibilities. Providing more resources without addressing these issues will not resolve the lack of effectiveness of the State Department.\nCorrectly or incorrectly, the State Department has been perceived as having internal political biases and entrenched institutional policy preferences and positions that make it difficult for Presidents to elicit enthusiastic support for policies that do not comport with those preferences. These general frustrations have been exacerbated by the urgency of pressures faced by modern Presidents. Recent Administrations have addressed this issue through increased political appointments, which are resented by career State Department employees who see it as limiting opportunities for their own advancement and, generally, eroding professionalism, effectiveness, and availability of institutional and practical skills and experience. To increase their direct control over foreign policy and their perceived capacity to deal with fast-evolving crises, modern Presidents have also increasingly empowered and expanded the size of the National Security Council (NSC).\nThe original NSC, established in 1947, comprised only a handful of key advisers to the President. It grew slowly at first. Total NSC staff did not exceed 20 until the 1970s, or 60 until the mid-1990s. The size of the NSC spiked in the late 1990s and stabilized at roughly 100 staff in the post-9/11 period. NSC growth resumed in the latter part of the George W. Bush Administration, and this trend has accelerated under President Barack Obama. Currently, the NSC staff is estimated to be over 400 people, more than twice the number at the end of the Bush Administration. This growth has been a direct result of the President relying more on the NSC to devise and implement his foreign policy than on the Department of State.\nThe 24-hour news cycle has thrust many issues, no matter how trivial, into the limelight, making them the President’s responsibility. The news media expect every tactical detail, from the timing of a raid on a terrorist bunker to the targets of drone attacks, to be known and controlled by the President. As a result, the NSC staff gets overly involved not only in the minutiae of operations, but also in politics. It begins to operate more as a personal White House staff than as an advisory and policy coordination staff, sometimes even to the point of acting like a Praetorian Guard for the President’s political fortunes, which is particularly inappropriate given that many people on the staff are career civil servants from national security agencies rather than political appointees. The results are quite often disastrous.\nAlong the same lines, Presidents have also felt the need at times to appoint personal confidants or representatives to address pressing issues. When the President relies too often or too heavily on individual “czars” or “envoys” to address discrete issues, however, he risks undermining clarity and consistency of policy, distorting the importance of issues in the overall spectrum of U.S. foreign policy interests, and confusing both U.S. and foreign officials about the chain of command through the multiple lines of communication to the President.\nAppoint the appropriate Secretary of State for the President. Obviously, every President should endeavor to appoint a competent and knowledgeable person as Secretary of State. But other qualities are vitally important as well. In particular, if foreign policy is to be led from the State Department, the Secretary must enjoy the trust and confidence of the President. Similarly, the Secretary should trust his or her team to competently fulfill its responsibilities. The personal presence or participation of the Secretary of State in negotiations should be the rare exception, not a common occurrence. If the Secretary spends as much time traveling as in Washington managing the department, it is a sign that something is amiss. Moreover, the Secretary of State should be willing and, ideally, eager, to work as part of the overall foreign policy team—as the primary lead—to avoid the turf wars and infighting that can paralyze the interagency process and tempt the President to rely disproportionally on the National Security Advisor or other advisers and czars.\nReduce the operational role of the NSC and place those responsibilities chiefly on Under and Assistant Secretaries of State. If the State Department is to resume its historical role in foreign policy and the NSC to revert to its traditional advisory and coordinating function, the need for a large NSC staff recedes. Instead, the operational lead should be the responsibility of the State Department’s Under and Assistant Secretaries. These positions should be filled by experienced career and political appointees capable of briefing the President on situations and presenting policy recommendations arrived at through interagency coordination.\nReturn the Policy Planning Staff to its original purpose, or eliminate it. The Policy Planning Staff was set up in 1947 to serve as an internal source of independent policy analysis and advice for the Secretary—similar to an internal State Department think tank. Indeed, the main purpose of the Policy Planning Staff, according to former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, was to “anticipate the emerging form of things to come, to reappraise policies which had acquired their own momentum and went on after the reasons for them had ceased, and to stimulate and, when necessary, to devise basic policies crucial to the conduct of our foreign affairs.” The Policy Planning Staff has not realized this purpose and, instead, has become more of a glorified speech writing staff and parking place for political assistants. If more speechwriters and political assistants are necessary, they should be employed in the Office of the Chief of Staff or the Executive Secretariat. As to the original intended purpose, if the Policy Planning Staff actually operated as a dedicated research and advisory staff on diplomacy and foreign policy, it could be useful. However, there is an abundance of independent diplomatic and foreign policy analysis and advice in the current era both from private-sector think tanks and academia and from government-funded institutions, such as the Institute of Peace. If it is to be retained, the Policy Planning Staff should provide unique value or fill critical gaps, not seek to replicate skills or work that is available elsewhere in government or outside of it.\nThere is no point in the United Nations Ambassador sitting around, as I did for a while, talking about ag policy. If there’s an N.S.C. meeting or a Cabinet meeting that impacts on the mission at the United Nations, Ambassador Pickering will be at the table.… I want to have an orderly flow in foreign policy making [and] the Ambassador should report, in my view, to the President through the Secretary of State.\nAs a practical matter, President George H. W. Bush was aware that cabinet-level rank inevitably leads the Ambassador to spend a significant amount of time in Washington, often on issues well outside his or her direct remit, taking away from responsibilities in New York. Another concern, however, is the risk of encouraging the Ambassador to view himself as a policymaking peer to the Secretary of State. This can foment tension and divisiveness and undermine department hierarchy. As observed by former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton, “[Y]ou shouldn’t have two secretaries in the same department.” Indeed, to better coordinate policy and re-establish proper lines of authority, the Permanent Representatives and the Missions to the United Nations should be brought under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs.\nCurtail the use of special envoys and special representatives. Special envoys have a long history, dating back to the earliest days of the republic when John Monroe helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase at the behest of President Thomas Jefferson. Historically, Presidents periodically have sought to tap the expertise of high-level, experienced diplomats who can apply clout, perspective, and relationships to better resolve particularly challenging matters. Under the current Administration, however, there has been a proliferation of special envoys and representatives of relatively minor stature to address a host of issues great and small, narrow and expansive. Currently, more than 60 special envoys, special representatives, coordinators, special advisers, and other senior officials are charged with leading numerous discrete issues. Some of these appointees focus on current crises, such as in Syria and Libya. Others, however, focus on broad thematic causes, such as global food security, international labor affairs, international disability rights, global youth issues, and climate change. Most of these senior officials are appointed by the President without need for Senate confirmation or consultation—and, hence, little oversight and accountability to the American people.\nThere are benefits of these political appointees: They can focus on discrete issues, they demonstrate executive branch dedication to the issue, they can circumvent existing lines of authority when there are disputes among agencies, and their special status can grant access not available to lower-level officials. However, these senior officials frequently see themselves as direct representatives of the Secretary or even the President with the authority to act outside of normal State Department lines of authority. This can foment tensions with the existing State Department bureaucracy with overlapping responsibilities, undermine the authority of U.S. Ambassadors, and create confusion for foreign governments as to who actually represents the President.\nMoreover, the proliferation of special envoys and other appointees is symptomatic of the dysfunction and dissatisfaction with the performance of the Department of State. If the President was confident in the ability of the State Department to address these matters effectively through the existing structure, there would be infrequent need for creating these types of appointments outside the core bureaucracy. More practically, the proliferation of special envoys and other senior appointments is duplicative and adds additional costs because even if they are unpaid, most require separate, additional funds for support staff, offices and equipment, travel, and other expenses.\nWhile these positions can be of use in some instances, they should not be used as an alternative to existing, but underperforming, options within the existing bureaucracy. Moreover, they should focus on immediate crises requiring intervention by a high-level presidential representative and should be eliminated upon resolving the current issue, or if progress is deemed unlikely or can be better or equally addressed through existing structures. The default option should be to assign responsibility to Ambassadors or officials whose responsibilities emcompass or overlap with the matter at hand.\nThere are sometimes good reasons for Presidents to appoint confidants and trusted advisers to key positions in important countries overseas. Indeed, in a number of instances, an Ambassador known to be a direct, personal representative of the Secretary of State or the President can be more effective than even the most knowledgeable and experienced career Foreign Service Officer. Early in the post-election transition, the next Administration should identify critical postings that merit placement of experienced high-level foreign policy hands or personal confidants of the President.\nThis process should not devolve into rewarding political supporters. The temptation to succumb to political patronage and reward unqualified individuals with plum posts in desirable locations has affected every Administration to a greater or lesser degree and, sometimes, to the detriment of the nation. The historical ratio of 68 percent career Foreign Service Officers versus 32 percent political appointees should serve as a guide on these matters. (See Table 1.) Ultimately, however, the most important factor is to appoint the most capable Ambassadors, whether career or political, and vet appointees to ensure that they are well-qualified even if they are nominated for ceremonial positions or ambassadorships in countries of minimal importance. Needless to say, this would enhance the effectiveness of America’s foreign policy, improve morale among those in the State Department who work with and support U.S. Ambassadors, and foster respect among foreign governments and people.\nIncrease Foreign Service assignments from three to five years. Assignments for State Department Foreign Service employees typically last for three years. This is done to allow those in undesirable assignments to move on relatively quickly and to provide the broadest number of distinct work experiences while still ensuring that individuals are able to make substantive contributions. However, this relatively short duration hinders productive capacity. A substantial portion of the first year is spent learning the ropes, while a substantial portion of the final year is spent seeking and securing the most desirable new assignment possible. In essence, a three-year deployment involves only 18 months to 24 months of full-time contribution from a fully capable employee. Five-year assignments would increase the productive time per assignment.\nConduct an in-depth evaluation of standards, training, and qualifications for both the Foreign Service and Civil Service. There has been an increasing tendency to blur the lines between the Foreign Service and Civil Service in the State Department.[ 28] This may not always be appropriate as some positions demand specified skills and training. A thorough evaluation should be conducted to determine which positions require Foreign Service expertise and which can or should be filled by Civil Service employees and reserve them as appropriate. In addition, an independent analysis should be conducted to determine if the five Foreign Service career tracks or “cones” (Consular Officers, Economic Officers, Management Officers, Political Officers, and Public Diplomacy Officers) remain relevant and properly oriented to meet the current and anticipated needs of the Department of State. In addition, a more rigorous system should be developed for performance evaluation, career education and re-certification, and pre-entry requirements, including emphasizing three years to five years of work experience in the military, private sector, or in the legislative or judiciary branches of government to expand the professional diversity of State Department officials.\nThe State Department consists primarily of regional and functional bureaus and offices. The regional bureaus deal with bilateral relations between the U.S. and other countries and also lead initiatives that are regionally focused. The functional bureaus typically deal with thematic issues, such as economics, arms control, human rights, migration, environmental issues, counterterrorism, and other issues that do not have a particular national or regional focus.\nAlthough there is general consistency over time, particularly in the regional bureaus, there has been a gradual shift in the State Department structure to expand the number, size, and resources of the non-regional bureaus. This shift has resulted in a proliferation of the number of functional and managerial bureaus, departments, and offices. Additions in recent presidencies, for instance, include the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, the Bureau of Energy Resources, the Office of Global Women’s Issues, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the Office of Global Criminal Justice.\nThe State Department’s own effort to cover all the various aspects of national security policy—economic, transnational, regional, security—has produced an exceedingly complex organizational structure. Developing a distinct “State” point of view is now extremely difficult and this, in turn, has reduced the department’s ability to exercise any leadership.\nOver the past decade, the impulse to create individual functional bureaus was useful substantively and politically; e.g., in the cases of human rights, democracy, law enforcement, refugees, political-military affairs, and nonproliferation. The problem is that overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness have been lost in the process….\nAs a result of these many deficiencies, confidence in the department is at an all-time low. A spiral of decay has unfolded over many years in which the Congress, reacting to inefficiencies within the department, has consistently underfunded the nation’s needs in the areas of representation overseas and foreign assistance. That underfunding, in turn, has deepened the State Department’s inadequacies. This spiral must be reversed.\nEstablish an Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. Although the U.S. might prefer otherwise, diplomatic, economic, and security matters are increasingly discussed, negotiated, implemented, and acted upon through multilateral initiatives or in international organizations. This reality is reflected in the proliferation of functional bureaus assigned to address many of these issues, which at times lead to conflict and competition with the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (located in the current structure among the regional bureaus under the authority of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs) that is charged with addressing many of these matters through U.S. policy in the United Nations system. The bureaucratic separation of these matters from the traditional diplomatic engagement of the regional bureaus can create gaps and conflicts in policy priorities. There needs to be better coordination of U.S. policy on multilateral matters that balances thematic and ideological efforts with practical diplomatic concerns and an empowerment of U.S. professionals engaged in these critical activities. To realize this, the next President should create an Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs who would coordinate and direct U.S. policy in international organizations and on multilateral efforts, responsibility for which is primarily placed in the functional bureaus, as is currently the case for human rights, democracy promotion, refugees, and international environmental issues. In addition, to better coordinate multilateral policy, the U.S. Missions to the United Nations in New York, Geneva, and elsewhere should report to and through this Under Secretary via the Assistant Secretary of International Organization Affairs.\nIn addition to improving coordination, this restructuring would also elevate the value of experience in multilateral diplomacy. U.S. Foreign Service Officers are encouraged to accumulate broad, disperate experiences to advance within the department. This can be a great asset as it provides a wide-ranging knowledge base, but the failure to emphasize multilateral diplomacy can be a disadvantage when facing counterparts who may have served decades in the same organization focusing on narrow or technical matters with the historical knowledge that such experience provides. To make clear their respective roles, the position of Under Secretary for Political Affairs should be retitled to Under Secretary for Bilateral Affairs.\nShift the responsibilities of most functional bureaus to the Under Secretary for Bilateral Affairs and the Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. To address the disconnect and division between the regional and functional bureaus, the Hart–Rudman Commission suggested creating five regional Under Secretaries along with Under Secretaries for Global Affairs and Management. The functional bureaus were to be subsumed into this structure. That recommendation correctly identified a key problem, but perhaps proposed an overly radical restructuring. Requiring closer coordination among the offices leading U.S. policy on these issues would better ensure that they are incorporated into a broader U.S. diplomatic and foreign policy framework without creating a zero-sum game in terms of resource allocation between bureaus. Indeed, organizational consolidation could create a positive budgetary impact through the elimination of unnecessary positions. Moreover, it would also likely increase efficiency and effectiveness in the bureaucracy by simplifying the spaghetti bowl of competing lines of authority within the State Department. Finally, the organizational consolidation could rebound favorably by elevating the influence of newly empowered State officials in the interagency process.\nDevelopment aid is not an end in itself, nor can it be successful if pursued independently of other U.S. programs and activities.… To be effective, U.S. development assistance must be coordinated with other diplomatic activities, such as challenging corrupt government practices or persuading governments to adopt more sensible land-use policies. Only a coordinated diplomatic and assistance effort will advance the nation’s goals abroad.\nThe Under Secretary of State for Economic Development should serve as the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The new bureau should encompass USAID; many of the current responsibilities of the current Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs; and primary responsibility (currently led by the Department of the Treasury) for U.S. policy at the World Bank and the regional development banks. If the next Administration decided to make the State Department the lead trade negotiator, it would make sense to move the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative out of the Executive Office of the President and place it under the authority of the Under Secretary of State for Economic Development. Otherwise, the bureau should minimize its activities on economic sanctions, trade policy and export promotion, and production of reports like the Country Commercial Guides, and restrict activities for which the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury have primary responsibility.\nEliminate the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. Most of the functional bureaus and offices overseen by this Under Secretary involve global concerns and matters that are also addressed by various international organizations, such as refugees and trafficking, international law enforcement, and human rights. These issues are important, but the current structure creates an artificial separation from the policy bureaus that can lead to counterproductive disputes or result in disregard through “out of sight, out of mind” behavior. Instead, issues like human rights and counterterrorism should be incorporated into the policy bureaus where they can receive due consideration and be weighed against other priorities to help develop a more robust and well-rounded U.S. policy position. Therefore, most of these responsibilities should be shifted under the new Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs where they can be incorporated and reconciled with similar and related U.S. multilateral policy priorities and objectives. A notable exception is the Bureau of Counterterrorism, which should shift to the Under Secretary for International Security Affairs. While overarching responsibility for issues like human rights and trafficking should shift to the Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs, the bilateral aspects of these activities should not be overlooked, and democracy and human rights country offices should be integrated into the regional bureaus.\nEliminate the position of Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources. There is no need for a second Deputy Secretary to oversee matters that can be, and until 2009 were, handled by the Deputy Secretary, the Executive Secretary, and the Under Secretary for Management.\nMerge complementary offices and bureaus and emphasize their overarching purpose. There has been an unfortunate tendency in recent years to elevate individual aspects of broader policy priorities and give them independent authority. This can create counter-productive firewalls, competition over resources or prioritization among what should be complementary initiatives, and confusion over who ultimately is in charge of policy. Effective policy addressing these matters requires a complementary approach, and those charged with addressing closely related issues should be located in the same office or bureau. For instance, trafficking in persons, a terrible and growing problem, relates closely to and frequently overlaps with refugee and migration concerns, so it makes sense to merge these responsibilities under the same office. Similarly, promoting human rights makes no sense if it is not linked to promoting representative government, so it makes sense to continue this linkage within an updated State Department structure. Likewise, women’s issues, civil rights, labor rights, religious liberty, and most basic human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing. They should be viewed and pursued as part of a comprehensive human rights agenda, not as distinct or discrete efforts, and should be merged into the overarching office for human rigths and democracy promotion. Along those same lines, as seen with Ebola, SARs, HIV/AIDS, and the Zika virus, just to name a few examples, communicable diseases that span global borders pose significant threats. To better address these threats, a reformed Department of State should include an office for international health, which should incorporate existing health-related offices, such as the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, and responsibilities, such as coordinating U.S. international policy to address or respond to transnational health threats in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other mergers and reorganizations should be considered and weighed against the current structure to determine if there are missed opportunities to capitalize on mutually reinforcing and harmonizing policies, programs, and agendas.\nReconsider lines of authority for non-U.N. multilateral organizations. For instance, the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO is placed in the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs. It is worth considering whether this security organization would be better placed with the Under Secretary for International Security Affairs, whose responsibilities would be more explicitly focused on international security threats, including counterterrorism, or even shifted to the Department of Defense with only a State liaison.\nTreat former U.S. territories as the independent nations they have become. Relations with former U.S. territories that are now independent (the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau) continue to primarily be handled through the U.S. Department of the Interior through its Office of Insular Affairs, which coordinates federal policy for those territories and is “responsible for administering and overseeing U.S. federal assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.” These territories are now independent nations and should be treated as such, with U.S. assistance being provided through the Department of State and USAID, rather than through legacy programs in the Department of the Interior.\nFigure 1 presents a revised State Department organization chart illustrating these changes.\nIn a world where information warfare is being conducted by major powers as well as by unconventional enemies of the United States, the U.S. government must have the tools to engage in the ongoing war of ideas. The challenges the United States faces in this sphere are as intense as they were during the Cold War, yet they are more diverse and complex. The United States is not just engaged in one war of ideas with the Communist Soviet Union. The United States must counter—with truth and news—the lies and false promises of a whole range of global actors, who represent threats to the United States, its allies, and the Western way of life.\nFrom Russia, the United States and its allies are bombarded with anti-American and reality-distorting propaganda. From China, more subtle influence operations include a global news network, funding of American universities, and well-produced and widely distributed publications in English. Terrorist groups, especially ISIS, are media savvy and produce slick propaganda aimed at radicalizing Muslims here and throughout the world.\nAbdicating the U.S. role in information warfare would send a huge signal to the world that the United States is assuming an isolationist position. It is not the kind of signal the country can afford to send when the world desperately needs U.S. leadership. Instability, conflict, and political repression in disparate areas of the world underscore the need for America to promote its policies and provide objective news and clear calls for freedom, representative governance, and mutual tolerance.\nReform the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Although the BBG was created to provide a firewall against political influence on its news broadcasting, its structure and lax observance of bylaws and agreed practices invites internal conflict and the creation of fiefdoms by individual governors. Even though it oversees multiple organizations and activities with a budget of close to $750 million, the BBG operates on a part-time basis; the nine members of the board, which include the Secretary of State ex officio, have other jobs, and meet once a month or less, and the absence of day-to-day leadership has impeded effective governance of the various entities overseen by the BBG. If there is to be a broadcasting board, it should reserve itself to overseeing the performance of the Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting, providing independent perspective and medium-term and long-term planning suggestions to the Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting and Congress, and serving as an independent vessel for staff to register complaints or constructive suggestions for improvement.\nMake the new position of Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting permanent. Established in 2014, the CEO answers only to the BBG. The position was created to fill the day-to-day leadership gaps created by a part-time BBG. However, the CEO position lacks the permanence and resulting authority that would arise from legislated reform. The CEO, appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress, should replace the leadership role performed by the BBG and be instructed to coordinate with the State Department on U.S. public diplomacy messaging and targeting.\nUnderscore that the mission of USIB is to promote and explain U.S. foreign and national security policy and provide news in areas of the world where there are no alternative free media sources. USIB has on occasion inappropriately downplayed its American message. It should be made clear that the purpose of USIB is not to be a U.S. government-funded CNN or BBC, but to support U.S. interests. When there is no pre-existing free and independent media, this mission encompasses the provision of objective news content. Specifically, USIB should focus on countries where representative government or a free and independent media are absent or inadequate, where there is conflict and political instability, or where U.S. interests justify a robust public diplomacy presence.\nDisaggregate the broadcasting services according to their functions. Voice of America (VOA) should become an explicit arm of U.S. public diplomacy overseen by the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Surrogate USIB media, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, should remain under the authority of the CEO for USIB and the BBG. They should more closely coordinate and share resources in order to increase efficiency and enjoy economies of scale, and should focus on bolstering America’s democracy promotion by providing unbiased news coverage, policy and political discussion, and, where governments constrain political speech, alternative outlets for political dissidents and minority parties. The USIB surrogates could benefit from an affiliation with the National Endowment for Democracy, whose mission they share.\nRegularly re-evaluate capabilities to ensure that foreign language services address enduring, pressing, and evolving needs. Short-sighted decisions have currently left the United States short of assets with which to counter the new Russian revanchism, the aggressive Chinese global media advances, and the ideological threats from militant Islam, to name a few of the critical challenges currently faced by this country.\nWork with Congress to enact a State Department authorization bill. It has been over a decade since a State Department authorization bill has been enacted, and the statutory foundation undergirding the department is showing its age with new offices and bureaus established without express congressional input, staff and budget expanded based on annual appropriations bills, and statutes habitually circumvented through appropriations riders for convenience rather than examined and changed through deliberative debate and process. The next Administration should engage Congress at an early stage to update and adjust the State Department’s authorizing language in order to better equip the department to meet the pressing challenges facing the nation from abroad.\nConsult closely with Congress on the appointment of special envoys, special representatives, special advisers, and other senior appointees. One motive behind the increasing number of special envoys, special representatives, special advisers, and other senior appointees in recent years may be the slow pace of Senate confirmations. Unlike Ambassadors and senior State Department appointees, most special envoys are not subject to Senate confirmation and thus can be put into place more quickly. But the non-confirmable appointees also circumvent congressional oversight and accountability and could, ironically, serve to irritate individual Senators or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and delay or hinder presidential appointees where Senate confirmation is required.\nWhile reasonable in so far as they go, these criteria leave substantial room for interpretation that ill-serves the constitutional process and America’s negotiating partners who cannot be certain of the status, permanence, and legality of an agreement with the U.S. The next Administration should work with Congress to expand factor No. 4 above by examining past practice on how various subjects have been treated historically (treaty, executive agreement, or congressional-executive agreement) and specify the issues or context that should mandate consideration of international agreements as treaties under Article II. The purpose of this examination should be to update and modernize the C-175 procedure in order to restore its original role as an effective mechanism for distinguishing various forms of international commitments.\nReview congressionally mandated reports. Over the years, Congress has enacted legislation requiring the State Department and other agencies to submit dozens of periodic reports on a broad array of issues. Some of these reports have been overtaken by events and, while they address concerns that were at one time of great concern to Congress or the American people, they no longer attract much attention or are largely irrelevant to current policy. Some reporting legislation requires updating to reflect changes over time. Other reports remain highly relevant and critical even though they may only be read or used by a small number of key committees and congressional staff.\nIn some cases, like the important and valuable annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the topics of the reports can increase stress in America’s bilateral relationships and create incentives for State to downplay situations if delicate negotiations or other priorities could be affected. In order to preserve the integrity of the content and protect it from political interference, Congress should consider giving responsibility for producing these reports to an independent, bipartisan U.S. federal government commission, similar to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, to create bureaucratic distance between the report and the State Department.\nOverall, however, the next Administration should engage Congress on a detailed review of existing reporting requirements to: (1) eliminate outdated or irrelevant reports that sap valuable time and resources from the State Department; (2) review and amend the terms of dated reports to make them more useful and germane to current concerns; and (3) retain and prioritize reports of special importance to authorizing or appropriating committees.\nEstablish a dedicated unit for international organizations in the Office of Inspector General for the Department of State. The U.S. remains dependent on the internal U.N. oversight mechanisms, many of which lack independence, have inadequate resources, or face problems with competence, corruption, or bias. The value of having a separate U.S. Inspector General unit that can investigate the activities funded in substantial part by U.S. taxpayers, is illustrated by reports of the U.S. Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) that has identified numerous management and oversight failings of U.N. Development Programme projects in Afghanistan.\nConduct a periodic cost-benefit analysis of U.S. participation in all international organizations. Although a number of U.N. organizations provide important contributions to U.S. diplomatic, economic, and security interests, not all do. The U.S. lacks a comprehensive analysis of whether these contributions are advancing or undermining U.S. interests or being used to maximum effect. An example of what the U.S. should do is the Multilateral Aid Review conducted by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development that assessed the relative value for U.K. aid money disbursed through multilateral organizations. This report identified those U.N. agencies providing poor value for money and led to the decision to zero out funding for four U.N. agencies. The last time the U.S. conducted a similar exercise, albeit in a far less rigorous manner, was under the Clinton Administration in 1995, which led directly to the U.S. decision to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The U.S. should not let two decades lapse before repeating this type of analysis.\nRenew the annual reporting on all federal agency contributions to the U.N. system to be conducted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Most U.S. contributions to the U.N. system come from the State Department, but millions of dollars also flow from other parts of the federal government. Thus, relying on State Department data, such as that in State’s annual report to Congress on U.S. contributions to international organizations, presents an incomplete picture. Because the OMB is in charge of overseeing the preparation of the President’s budget, it is able to require all U.S. agencies to report the requested information. Previous legislation mandated similar reports on U.S. contributions to the U.N. system for fiscal years 2001–2010. That legislative requirement has since lapsed. Thus, the first of these reports should require information for FY 2011 through the most recently completed fiscal year to fill in the reporting gap.\nTo effectively confront the challenges facing America, the next President will need a focused and efficient State Department that is capably led, properly structured, and dedicated to implementing the President’s foreign policy initiatives. Simply increasing resources will not address the widely acknowledged shortcomings of the Department of State. The above recommendations are not comprehensive, but if embraced and implemented, would contribute to ensuring that the President is better served by a more effective and accountable State Department.\n—Brett D.

        "prompt": "On Tuesday, November 4th, voters in Montclair will have the opportunity to join a growing number of New Jersey municipalities that allow private sector workers to earn paid sick days. A local ballot initiative would allow nearly all private sector workers to earn 3-5 days per year to care for themselves or their families when illness strikes. For voters who want to keep Montclair’s families, workplaces and local economy healthy, our top priority can be found at the bottom of the November 4th ballot.\nFor people with paid sick days, it can be easy to take them for granted. But nearly one quarter of adults in the United States have either lost their job or had their job threatened because of a family illness. For the over 40 percent of Montclair workers who lack paid sick days, every cold becomes a crisis and every child’s fever could spell economic catastrophe.\nAllowing workers to earn paid sick days isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do for our community. Workers without sick days go to work sick or send their sick children to school, prolonging illnesses and spreading infectious diseases. During the H1N1 epidemic, 7 million people caught the virus because co-workers came to work sick. Even worse, food service, personal healthcare and childcare workers are the least likely to have paid sick days. It puts us all at risk.\nEvery time a paid sick day law is proposed, some businesses insist the sky will fall. But the dire predictions never materialize. Six in seven San Francisco employers reported no decrease in profitability after its law went into effect. Far from abusing the law, workers used their sick days as intended. The average worker in Connecticut and San Francisco used only half of the days allotted to them. In San Francisco, a quarter of workers used no sick days at all.\nAnd far from losing jobs, San Francisco and Seattle both outpaced their neighbors in job growth since passing paid sick days laws. Jersey City has also gained jobs more quickly than the rest of the state since passing New Jersey’s first paid sick days law in January.\nThat’s because paid sick days laws keep our economy healthy, too. People coming to work sick costs our country $180 billion per year through reduced productivity and increased workplace infection, higher than the cost of absenteeism. Paid sick days reduce employee turnover, one of the biggest costs for business. And, as with minimum wage increases, workers use the additional pay to spend in local businesses, stimulating the economy.\nThis is a win-win for Montclair workers and businesses. We urge voters to vote YES on the municipal public question at the bottom of the ballot for a stronger, healthier Montclair.\nI really don’t care who does it, but would someone at least provide the courtesy of posting the actual ordinance? Since BlueWave is a sponsor and has a website, you would be the logical candidate.\nEmployees are already allowed to earn paid sick days. When I was still working in Montclair, we all earned paid sick days. If that were the goal, this question wouldn’t need to be on the ballot. This proposal is to *require* people to earn paid sick days. Employers don’t get to choose. Employees don’t get to choose.\nIf someone considers himself healthy and prefers to take this benefit’s value as cash, he’ll be forced to work outside of Montclair.\nI think it telling that this post – and the version I’d originally seen in the Montclair Times – uses the word “allow” rather than “require”. It would suggest that the supporters are trying to keep the truth obscured.\nIt is also interesting that this would, if passed, prevent any changes for three years. That suggests that the supporters expect that, after seeing the results, Montclair voters are likely to want to fine-tune or even remove this requirement. Yet we’d be prevented from doing so.\nhttps://baristanetnew.wpengine.com/2014/10/montclair-vote-mandatory-sick-leave-ordinance/#comment-406022 presents an example of the call banks promoting this question providing bad information. A friend reported something similar when she was called, and even my wife received bad information when she was asking questions of the caller.\nWhile a few examples of those could be the result of an overly enthusiastic but ill-informed caller, now we have this letter. This letter repeatedly misstates the result of this proposal, making it seem far more permissive than it actually is.\nThose promoting this proposal seem to be among those questioning it. Even they apparently believe that a fully informed electorate would likely vote against it. The three year period during which it cannot be changed also speaks to this presumption that we’ll ultimately conclude that this is a bad thing for Montclair.\nIf even those proposing and supporting this question think we’d conclude it’s bad for Montclair, then I think the proper choice fairly clear.\nThis is a",

        "prompt": "Insurance companies set premiums based on experience. When they lack experience, as with Obamacare, they make assumptions. One assumption that carriers used in setting 2014 premiums was that a bailout would be available if premiums turn out to be too low. The law establishes “risk corridors” for individual and small group insurance, under which the government will reimburse insurance companies’ losses, up to a point. The risk corridors encourage insurers to quote lower premiums, since they are protected (again, up to a point) by the federal government. But the risk corridor provisions of the act expire in 2016.\nEven more fundamental is the composition of the risk pool in the Obamacare exchanges. The economics of Obamacare, and therefore the premiums charged by insurers, depend entirely on how healthy or sick the people who enroll in Obamacare turn out to be. The Obama administration made projections on this subject, as did the insurers. I don’t think there is any doubt about the fact that actual enrollments in the exchanges have been disappointing from this standpoint. There are nowhere near as many young, healthy people signing up as will be required to make the system work. This is why the Obama administration has embarrassed itself in trying to recruit young people into the program, with Pajama Boy, Obama’s pathetic “Between Two Ferns” interview, Angry Mom, and so on. What this means is that once the insurance companies are able to set premiums based on actual experience, as opposed to rosy projections, those premiums inevitably will rise due to the risk pool being lower-quality than predicted.\nHealth industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration",

        "prompt": "Shopping for a new Volkswagen Tiguan?\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan’s optional third-row seat takes up cargo space and is best for kids.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan has a spacious interior and a comfortable ride, but its price climbs quickly.\nAmong crossover SUVs, the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan stands out for its spacious interior—so long as every seat isn’t filled in seven-seat versions.\nThe VW Tiguan aces real-world utility with its excellent outward vision, comfortable interior, available active safety gear, and good infotainment system. It’s less thrifty than some rivals and its third row—well, the dog will like it.\nAfter an extensive redesign last year, the Tiguan is unchanged for 2019.\nAvailable in S, SE, and SEL trim levels, the Tiguan comes standard with front-wheel drive and offers all-wheel drive as an option. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 184 horsepower is paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Tiguan rides softly, with good composure thanks in part to its 109.8-inch wheelbase. Its steering is quick and light, and it has a confident feel on a curvy road.\nAt 24 mpg combined with all-wheel drive, the Tiguan lags competitors such as the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, which come closer to 30 mpg combined.\nThose rivals don’t offer three rows of seats, although we don’t consider the third row that’s standard on front-drive Tiguans and optional with all-wheel drive to be a major asset. The Tiguan’s front seats are firm and supportive, while row two boasts excellent ingress and egress and a bench that slides forward for more leg room or cargo space. That third row, though. It robs valuable cargo room.\nMost Tiguans have standard active safety hardware such as automatic emergency braking, and the IIHS has given it a Top Safety Pick award, but the NHTSA hasn't rated the compact crossover yet.\nAt about $29,000 with all-wheel drive, the Tiguan SE is a lot of crossover for the money. The range-topping Tiguan SEL Premium trim level loads on niceties such as a digital instrument cluster, a panoramic moonroof, adaptive cruise control, and leather upholstery, but it costs nearly $40,000.\nAll Tiguans include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.\nThe 2019 Tiguan is not related to the Tiguan Limited, an older design that VW discontinued after the 2018 model year but may still be in dealer inventories.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan is an exercise in styling restraint.\nThe 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan’s styling is forgettable—unless it’s painted in bright orange. It may not be the boldest compact crossover SUV, but the 2019 Tiguan has clean, simple lines that will age well.\nThe 2019 Tiguan stretches about 185 inches from bumper to bumper, making it among the largest compact crossover SUVs. Up front, its grille is wide but not tall, and it’s flanked by halogen headlights on most trims. The Tiguan SEL Premium is the only trim with LED headlights.\nFrom the side, the Tiguan’s long, nearly 110-inch wheelbase gives it big doors for easy ingress and egress. The long rear door doesn’t do much for its looks, however. The Tiguan’s tail end is simple and pert, with LED taillights on all trims parked high on the rear fenders and tailgate.\nStandard 17-inch wheels on the Tiguan S look small in the crossover’s wheel wells. The 18- and 20-inch wheels available on SE and SEL trims fill things out better.\nThe optional R-Line appearance package is costly, about $1,500, and it doesn’t add any functionality.\nInside, the Tiguan has a low, car-like dashboard that follows the same simple design theme as its exterior. A 6.5-inch touchscreen for infotainment takes up residence below climate vents and above controls for heating, air conditioning, and some secondary functions. VW offers a wide selection of interior hues, such as coal bin black or two-tone black and orange.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan has little power to spare, but its suspension provides a luxurious ride.\nThe turbo-4 is rated at 184 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque and it shuttles power to either the front or all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic. The 2019 Tiguan’s engine builds power quickly, but its transmission can fire off clunky shifts around town and despite the number of cogs it’s not eager about downshifting for highway passing.\nWe’ve noticed a gruff, unrefined feel to the engine at low speeds away from a stop, too.\nWhat we do like is the Tiguan’s comfortable ride. It takes undulating pavement in stride, even with the optional 20-inch wheels with their narrow sidewalls.\nThe Tiguan’s flat-bottom three-spoke steering wheel could have been plucked from a VW GTI, but steering feel is limited. The Tiguan handles with poise and confidence, although it’s light on entertainment even in the sport mode that adds heft but not road communication.\nAt highway speeds, the Tiguan boasts excellent straight-line stability and limited wind and road roar.\nThe optional all-wheel-drive system provides surefooted traction on dirt roads and in snowy conditions. With 7.9 inches of ground clearance and long overhangs, the Tiguan is less suited to rocky trails to campsites than a few of its rivals, however.\nPlenty of space for everyone can be found in the 2019 VW Tiguan, as long as they’re not in the optional third row.\nThe 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan splits the difference between compact and mid-size crossover SUVs, meaning it’s more spacious than a Honda CR-V but not as big inside as a Toyota Highlander.\nThe VW Tiguan’s front seats are firm and supportive, with good adjustment and lumbar support. The standard cloth upholstery on the Tiguan S has a grippy, tough feel, although the synthetic leather fitted to SE and SEL trims is durable and easy to clean. The Tiguan SEL Premium drapes its interior in leather—as it should for nearly $39,000.\nAccess to the second row is via one of the biggest door openings this side of a Boeing 737. Once aboard, passengers in coach class will find leg room more akin to Main Cabin Extra or Economy Plus when the three-seat bench is slid all the way back. The bench slides forward to expand cargo capacity to 48.6 cubic feet on five-seat Tiguans. The optional third row seat—mandatory with front-wheel drive—robs about 2.5 cubic feet.\nThe Tiguan’s third row is difficult to access and not suitable for adults. Kids who can fit back there are probably small enough that they should be in booster seats, which robs more utility.\nOur advice? If you need a third row VW, look across the showroom at the larger Atlas.\nThe Tiguan has decent interior materials for what it costs. Soft-touch, low-sheen surfaces drape its front doors and dashboard. As is typical for compact crossover SUVs, rear-seat riders get stuck with hard plastics. At least there are two small vents to cool or warm those passengers.\nSurprisingly, the 2019 VW Tiguan has not been fully crash tested by the NHTSA.\nWhat crash tests have been performed on the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan have yielded good results, but we’re still waiting on the feds to run one into a wall.\nAll but the base Tiguan S come standard with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and blind-spot monitors. Those features cost about $850 on the S trim—money well spent.\nThe Tiguan SEL adds adaptive cruise control, while the SEL Premium includes active lane control, automatic high-beam headlights, and parking sensors.\nThe NHTSA performed side-impact crash tests on the 2019 Tiguan. It earned five stars, but the feds noted that the driver’s door unlatched and opened during their test. The feds have not performed frontal crash tests on the 2019 Tiguan.\nThe base 2019 VW Tiguan is a good value, but loaded models are surprisingly expensive.\nAt about $28,000 with all-wheel drive and a $850 option package that includes active safety tech, the 2019 Tiguan S is a good value. It includes a 6.5-inch touchscreen for infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bluetooth, and cruise control. It’s hardly lavish, but it’s not lacking much.\nThe Tiguan SE costs about $29,000, and it’s the one we’d buy. For that extra $1,000, buyers get an 8.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment, standard active tech, keyless ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, and synthetic leather upholstery.\nThe costliest Tiguan is the SEL Premium. With its leather seats, power liftgate, active lane control, parking sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and Fender audio system, it’s equipped—and priced—like a luxury crossover. With all-wheel drive and a $1,500 R-Line appearance package, the Tiguan SEL Premium costs about $40,000.\nAll Tiguans include a 6-year, 72,000-mile warranty that’s transferable to subsequent owners.\n",

One minute you are being recognised by higher powers for being in the form of your life, the next you come back down to earth with a season-ending injury.\nUnfortunately for Peterborough United midfielder Jermaine Anderson, that is exactly what has happened to him.\nThe 19-year-old was named Football League Young Player of the Month for November, a month in which he scored four goals in four games.\nBut just three minutes into the FA Cup visit of Luton on 6 December, he suffered a knee injury which will keep him out for the rest of the campaign.\nAnderson told BBC Sport: \"It's difficult, but it's football. Football loves to spring surprises on you and it's just how you deal with it which sums you up.\n\"It's a shame for it to happen but I'll be working hard with the physio, doing my rehab and hopefully coming back better, fitter, stronger and I'll see if I can improve on other areas of the pitch.\"\nPeterborough United have become the first club to have three winners of the Football League Young Player of the Month award - Anderson, Britt Assombalonga and Marcus Maddison.\nIt is not the first time in his short career that the London-born midfielder has had a long-term lay-off, having missed the end of last season after breaking his foot.\nBut, almost certainly speaking from experience, Anderson is philosophical about his road to recovery.\n\"It's not an injury you can't come back from, loads of people come back from it all the time,\" he said.\n\"It's just whether or not I want to put in the work or not, which obviously I will do to get back to how I was playing.\n\"I think with the people that I have around me, the physios and the management staff, they won't allow me not to come back to how I used to be. It won't be easy, but I will come back to how I was.\"\nBefore his injury, Anderson was a key member of Posh's midfield diamond, a system that has given the Cambridgeshire club new life since manager Graham Westley took over at the ABAX Stadium in September.\nUnder the former Stevenage boss, Posh have climbed from 18th in League One to a play-off place, with Anderson's goalscoring run more than the rest of his career combined.\n\"The gaffer telling me I need to score more goals and affect the game going forward,\" replied Anderson.\n\"In training I was working on late runs into the box, doing more work on finishing in and outside the box and knowing when to go for headers and crosses because our full-backs get up high and get good balls into the box.\n\"I think he's made me a more attacking player because I was doing well defensively but I wasn't getting many assists or goals. That's something him and Grant McCann noticed straight away - to make me an all-round midfielder.\"\nHis form sees him follow in the footsteps of his close friend, Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli, who won the award in August 2014.\nThe pair know each other from international youth teams and playing against one another in development squads.\nAsked if they would speak",

        "prompt": "The biggest news item from Subaru this year was the introduction of the long-awaited Subaru Ascent. Resting atop the new Subaru global platform currently used by Crosstrek and Impreza, the new Ascent will be the first large vehicle to use the new architecture.\nAt first glance, there’s immediate Subaru signature design cues in both the exterior grille and interior treatments. The biggest thing about the Ascent is it sheer size – it feels odd to see such a large Subaru body. But it is attractive, reflecting subtle sophistication with a capable athletic stance.\nAs dedicated as the Subaru loyal seem to be to the booming all-wheel-drive brand, even their enthusiasm waned when it came to the Tribeca, the biggest Subaru of the day, which went away in 2014.\nWhile providing a step-up vehicle for growing families who started with Outbacks and Foresters, the Tribeca SUV never had the sales impact the brand needed from it. Built in Lafayette, IN, the Ascent is exclusive to the North American market, as it offers Subaru’s notable reliability, legendary endurance, eight-passenger capacity, and all-wheel-drive surefootedness.\nThe big news distinction regarding the Ascent is the potential three-row eight-passenger capacity. Entry and exit from row three, which can be challenging for any SUV design, is notable for its big space, providing simple access via a sliding row two and grab handles for extra ease.\nAccording to Subaru, the grab handles on the row-two seats were inspired by Japan’s famously well-thought-out bullet train interior designs.\nBoth the Premium and Limited trim levels will offer a choice of cabin configuration for rows two and three. At no additional expense, Ascent owners may pick from a traditional second row bench or captain’s chairs (one provides 7-passenger seating, the other 8).\nAside from the obvious Impreza performance exceptions, Subaru does not necessarily hang its hat on high-speed performance being a requirement for its vehicles. A new 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four engine will be paired to a CVT transmission. Subaru has had great success with these pairings and the big Ascent should benefit from that success.\nSubaru’s symmetrical all-",

That's not going to happen in anybody's world.\n\"If Alex Salmond had the courage of his convictions, he would sit down and talk to me and Alistair about whether he could keep the pound, and be straight with the Scottish people.\"\nHe added: \"It's important for us to work together.\n\"Once Scotland decides what it wants to do with its independence vote, we will have to deal with the circumstances as we find them.\n\"I fervently hope that will mean Scotland is still in the UK, but if Scotland chooses to go for independence then we have got to try and make that work.\n\"But Alex Salmond has got to be straight with people about what that would mean, and he can't promise the pound, which I think would be very difficult.\n\"He can't promise to keep taxes down, I think they would go up for Scotland.\n\"He can't promise to keep interest rates down, there would be a higher interest charge for Scotland because of uncertainty.\n\"And, more generally, I think it would lead to very big and difficult questions for Scotland's relationships with the rest of the UK and the EU.\n\"Now, we will work together and try and make things work in that eventuality, but it's not going to be a good outcome for Scotland.\n\"It would be very difficult indeed to see how any UK government could negotiate for a separate sovereign state to keep the pound.\n\"I can't see how it would ever be in the interests of Scotland to sign up to that because it would mean massive restrictions on fiscal policy here in Scotland, on taxing and spending, and it would be very risky for any financial services company based in Scotland.\n\"The one thing that you can say absolutely is if Scotland leaves the UK it would lead to a lengthy period of instability and uncertainty, which would mean higher interest rates, higher taxes, it would be a hit to the Scottish economy.\n\"That negotiation on EU membership for Scotland would be very difficult.\n\"I hope Scotland would eventually be able to be a member of the EU but there would be some tough discussions with Brussels.\n\"It wouldn't surprise me at all if the message from Brussels was 'you must join the euro'.\n\"Alex Salmond seems to be saying that he would be willing, if he has to, to have an independent Scottish currency.\n",

        "prompt": "Two military veterans and political novices, tapping into broad discontent with Congress and President Donald Trump, have emerged as formidable Democratic challengers to entrenched Central Texas Republican congressmen — at least when it comes to raising money.\nThe surprising fundraising numbers don’t signal tight races necessarily, but more than a year before the general election, Democratic candidates in Republican-held districts in Austin and beyond are converting liberal outrage in the age of Trump into cash.\n\"Trump’s lower than average net approval ratings for a Republican in Texas, as well as anger and dismay within the activist ranks of the Democratic Party, has resulted in more than 50 Democratic candidates launching bids to flip the state’s 25 Republican held seats in 2018,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.\nJoseph Kopser, an Austin tech executive and 20-year Army veteran who was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq, reported raising $213,000 during the three months ending Sept. 30 — $14,000 more than incumbent U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, raised during that period.\nBut Smith, who was first elected to Congress in 1986, has almost $1 million cash on hand while Kopser has a little over $219,000. The 21st District, which includes staunchly liberal pockets west and south of downtown Austin, encompasses conservative Hill Country counties, and was drawn to elect a Republican. Still, Kopser and two other Democratic challengers are counting on Smith’s climate change skepticism as chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee to draw Democrats and independents to the polls next year.\n\"Lamar Smith needs to be paying close attention,\" said Calvin Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political science professor. \"His district is evolving, and he has some issue positions especially on global warming he’s going to have to defend.\"\n\"There is an energy on the Democratic side that is showing in a larger number of candidates,\" said Jillson, who added that Texas being a red state made it \"very difficult\" to defeat Republican incumbents.\nKopser, at least, is playing to that energy.\n\"It’s becoming apparent that Smith is so out of touch he doesn’t even realize how fired up his district is today,\" said Kopser, who co-founded a clean energy transportation company and is being supported by a pro-science group, 314 Action. Other Democratic candidates challenging Smith: Derrick Crowe, an Austin organizer and former congressional staffer, who raised $25,000, and Elliott McFadden, CEO of the nonprofit Austin B-cycle, who raised $16,000.\nSmith, who was re-elected last fall with 57 percent of the vote, didn’t return a request for comment.\nIn Round Rock, Mary Jennings Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot, reported raising $93,000 July 1-Sept. 30, in her bid to run against U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, who raised $113,000 during the same period. Carter, a former state district judge who was first elected to Congress in 2002, has $437,000 in his campaign coffers, compared with just $54,000 for Hegar.\nThe district, which includes a large part of Fort Hood, skews Republican, but in several Round Rock and Cedar Park precincts, Democrat Hillary Clinton outpolled Trump last November.\n\"I’m really pleased we out-raised him by about $10,000 in individual contributions,\" said Hegar, attributing Carter’s fundraising edge to corporate and PAC contributions. \"We have the grass roots on the ground.\"\nHegar is the author of the bestselling book, \"Shoot Like a Girl: One Woman’s Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front,\" which is being made into a movie starring Angelina Jolie. Hegar was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.\nShe was also a lead plaintiff in a 2012 lawsuit that challenged the Pentagon’s prohibition against women in combat, which was later repealed.\nAlso running for the Democratic nomination in Congressional District 31: Kent Lester, a 20-year Army veteran and former high school teacher in Belton, who raised $33,000 over the last three months.\nCarter also has a GOP opponent, Georgetown businessman Mike Sweeney, who raised nearly $7,800. He also challenged Carter in 2016, losing in the primary.\nCarter, who was re-elected last fall with 58 percent of the vote, said in a statement to the American-Statesman, \"As I visit with my neighbors around District 31, I’m confident in their support for my re-election.\"\nU.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, a former Texas secretary of state, raised $180,000 during the third quarter and has $1.1 million cash on hand. Democratic challengers Chetan Panda, who is from Austin and works in finance, raised $79,000; Kathi Thomas, a Hays County businesswoman, raised $14,000 and Austin attorney Chris Perri — who had been running in Smith’s district until a few days ago — raised $28,000.\nU.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, hasn’t drawn an opponent reporting contributions to the Federal Election Commission. McCaul raised $221,000 but has only $218,000 cash on hand, an indicator that he was weighing an exit from electoral politics. Last month McCaul was passed over to be secretary of homeland security — for the second time — and the Trump administration recently announced the nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen, a top aide to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, to the post.\n\"They went in a different direction — to a career official instead of a politician,\" McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the Statesman. \"I think they valued my leadership in the House. I think that was part of the calculation.\"\nMcCaul on Wednesday announced his re-election campaign co-chairs, who include Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\nMcCaul, who is expected to step down as head of the homeland security panel because he is reaching the end of a limited term, said he is pursuing the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\nU.S. Rep.

        "prompt": "Bill Gausman (right), senior vice president of asset management, and other Pepco officials prepare to testify Tuesday morning in Baltimore during a Maryland Public Service Commission hearing on Pepco's response to recent storm-related power outages.\nPepco's record on service interruptions to its customers has been below the median for utilities nationwide for several years, its executive said under questioning from the Maryland Public Service Commission on Tuesday.\nAnd for the past two years, Pepco has been in the bottom 50 percent or 25 percent of that performance measure, said Bill Gausman, Pepco's senior vice president for asset management and planning.\n\"We strive to move toward the first or second quartile,\" he said.\nPepco officials spoke at a public hearing Tuesday called by the PSC after state and local officials requested for an investigation following the latest series of power outages during summer storms. A number of Montgomery County officials attended the hearing in Baltimore, including eight of the nine County Council members. Councilman Michael J. Knapp (D-Dist. 2) of Germantown did not attend because he away on a family vacation.\nHundreds of thousands of Pepco customers in Montgomery and Prince George's counties lost power for up to five days during the two February snowstorms and three severe summer storms since July 25.\nDuring the hearing, Gausman said Pepco is closer to the industry average on the duration of its outages.\nCommission Chairman Douglas R.M. Nazarian asked, \"When would you expect to get above average performance?\"\n\"I would like to say it's probably a four-year program,\" Gausman replied.\n\"Why is it acceptable to have acceptable performance in four years?\" Nazarian responded.\nPepco is prepared to accelerate some improvements, David Velazquez, executive vice president of power delivery, told the five commissioners.\nA recently approved rate hike will help pay for those, including more aggressive tree trimming to curb falling trees and limbs that Pepco says causes most of its outages.\nBut getting property owners to allow them to trim as far as they must to clear the lines and not endanger the tree, as state foresters require, can be difficult, Pepco executives said.\nIn March, Pepco told the PSC it would take about 10 years to catch up on its four-year tree trimming maintenance program.\nOn Tuesday, officials said the rate increase would help, but they still would not catch up for several years.\nMeanwhile, the utility is spending more to increase efficiency on its worst-performing power feeders, including burying some lines underground, and has gotten a 50 to 60 percent improvement in their performance, Gausman said.\nBut a review by The Gazette of the utility's own reports to the PSC show as many as 1 percent of the utility's feeders have outage frequency or outage duration measures that are at least five times Pepco's own subpar system average.\nAccording to reports filed with the PSC, a key reliability measurement, the System Average Interruption Frequency Index, was about 61 percent higher for Pepco in 2009 than for Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. and more than 100 percent higher than for Allegheny Power in Maryland.\nThat index, which measures the average number of outages per customer, was 2.06 for Pepco in Maryland, 1.28 for BGE and less than 1 for Allegheny.\nIn 2008, the index, known as SAIFI, was 2.85, or 2.26 per customer for Pepco depending on whether major event outages were included.\nFor BGE, the index was 1.83 or 1.68, and for Allegheny, it was 1.33 or 1.16.\nWhile there is no national or Maryland SAIFI standard, a U.S. Department of Energy-funded study published in 2008 by Earnest Orlando Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory found an average SAIFI of 1.54 or 1.31 in 2006 for electric utilities in the United States that reported data.\nThe same study found SAIFI averages of 1.94 or 1.5 for utilities in the South Atlantic region, which includes Maryland, and 1.54 or 1.13 for the mid-Atlantic region to the north.\nRegarding the recent storms, Mike Sullivan, Pepco's senior vice president of operations, said, \"We are not terribly disappointed in our response,\" although perhaps Pepco could have added more crew leaders and assessment staff earlier.\nPepco region President Thomas Graham said the utility could have worked with local governments earlier to take advantage of the services they offered.\nBut Graham and Sullivan said they were not sure they could have brought in much more help without those assisting getting in each other's way.\n\"We had all the crews we could handle,\" Sullivan said.\n\"There's a bigger issue here than just storm events,\" Commissioner Susanne Brogan said, pointing to the utility's high outage rate in normal conditions.\nPepco has admitted failures in informing the public and estimating when their power would be restored.",

        "prompt": "After nearly a year of waiting, Amazon and Microsoft this week brought Alexa to Windows 10 PCs and Cortana to Echo speakers.\nOvernight, the move delivered Cortana to millions of Echo speakers and Alexa to hundreds of millions of personal computers in the United States. The Echo line of smart speakers continues to enjoy the largest market share, and Windows 10 is installed on nearly 700 million computers.\nThe partnership was made in recognition of the fact that we live in a multi-assistant world.\n“The world is big and so multifaceted. There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement when the partnership was announced last August.\nThe idea makes sense. I’m ready for a world in which assistants feel more like apps you access on a platform rather than standalone operating systems.\nI’d like to have to have an assistant dedicated to fitness, like the kind Google is reportedly working on, or one to help with cooking or meetings, maybe even one for dating or matters of personal growth.\nPersonally, I’d rather have assistants informed by mountains of data within an area of expertise than one with a range of moderately developed features that tells jokes.\nThe multi-assistant world is a narrative that works for Amazon and Microsoft and startups who want to enter the AI assistant space, but that point of view may be about more than the evolution of AI assistants. Their assistants need to live in a multi-assistant world, whereas Google Assistant and Siri arguably do not.\nGoogle and Apple‘s assistants don’t need to branch out because they enjoy a monopoly where it matters most: in your pocket.\nSmart speakers are growing at a rapid rate, with global sales up 187 percent in Q2 2018, but the smartphone is still far and away the device people are most likely to use when speaking with an assistant. This has been shown to be true in survey after survey after survey.\nUnlike Microsoft and Amazon, Apple and Google have the option of tethering multimodal experiences to speakers and iOS or Android mobile operating systems.\nThat’s not to say companies like Microsoft and Amazon don’t stand a chance. As smartphone sales go flat, smart speaker sales are expected to grow sixfold in the years ahead. In fact, smart speakers represent an opportunity to disrupt the dominance of smartphones and change consumer behavior on a massive scale.\nAn Accenture survey of 21,000 consumers around the world found that the majority of smart speaker owners are less likely to use their smartphones for tasks like entertainment, purchasing, and general searches while at home.\nGoogle has maintained its lead over Amazon in global smart speaker sales for the second quarter in a row, but it’s been suggested that Google should give away Home Minis for free because Amazon’s presence in millions of homes with Echo speakers could eat into Google’s search and shopping revenue.\nEven being the native assistant on a smartphone doesn’t guarantee victory in the fierce competition for consumer loyalty. The assistant still has to, as Cortana product lead Javier Soltero put it, win the Pepsi taste test challenge for users.\nExclusive features that take advantage of each companies‘ unique attributes could lead to people preferring Google Assistant because Duplex is so good at automating appointment scheduling or favoring Cortana because its natural language understanding has been advanced by the work of Microsoft’s new conversational AI center at UC Berkeley. Could you imagine if Cortana got incredibly smart about LinkedIn and GitHub insights? That would be powerful and is something only Microsoft can do.\nBut barring some sort of extraordinary developments, assistants in smartphones still enjoy a key advantage.\nWe’ll find out in time if people actually use Cortana on Echo speakers or Alexa on Windows 10 PCs, or whether doing so changes expectations about how assistants should function. But no matter how this experiment is received, the smartphone is still the primary place people interact with an AI assistant, and not even a collaboration between two of the biggest tech companies on the planet can change that — at least for now.\nP.",

        "prompt": "Even for a president who advertised his coldblooded pragmatism, the moral dimensions of leadership find a way of penetrating the Oval Office. In the case of President Trump, the emotional distance seems to have been shattered by simple, indelible images of suffering children in Idlib, Syria.\n“When you kill innocent children, innocent babies — babies! — little babies … that crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines,” Trump said Wednesday, his voice high and stretched, after pictures surfaced of lifeless infants choked to death by poison gas.\nWith that conviction, Trump took military action Thursday night, ordering retaliatory missile attacks on a Syrian air base. American interventionism is our best and worst national trait. Historically, until 1941, the United States was a reluctant warrior, fearful of foreign entanglement. Thursday marked the 100th anniversary of America’s entry into World War I, a conflict that still drips with senseless, dutiful killing. The young men of Europe had been slaughtering each other since 1914, but on the other side of the Atlantic it was “America First” until Congress backed Woodrow Wilson and declared war on April 6, 1917.\nTrump’s wariness on Syria had been like President Barack Obama’s: He said repeatedly, over the past six years and during the campaign, that he opposed more headlong U.S. military actions in quests that might be morally urgent but strategically fuzzy. Republican hawks such as Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) had blasted Obama’s reluctance to intervene, but not Trump. Back in 2013, he’d argued against calls to bomb Syria in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons.\nGiven that Trump’s view of Syria was so similar to Obama’s, his attempt to blame the latest chemical attack there on his predecessor’s alleged weakness was especially dubious. It displayed his embattled, defensive self-image: He is a victim of someone else’s bad decisions.Why did Assad use nerve gas in Idlib? It’s impossible to know. Maybe it was a signal to an increasingly aggressive Israel that he still had chemical weapons, or maybe it was a warning to Russia that he wasn’t a pawn to be traded in a grand bargain with Trump. But most likely, it was a reaction to the free hand he was seemingly given when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a few days earlier during a visit to Turkey that Assad’s future “will be decided by the Syrian people”",

But she has little recollection of a critical four-day period when: she was diagnosed; her organs began failing and her kidneys started shutting down; she lost the ability to move her left leg and arm; life-saving treatment commenced; and her condition improved significantly.\nShe’s continued with the plasma exchange every day since.\nBut her brush with death has changed her perspective, she said. These days she wants to live life to the fullest.\nIt took only a few days of treatment before Freeman’s condition went back to almost normal, said kidney specialist Dr. Amit Bagga.\nIf all goes as planned, he expects to stop the daily two-and-a-half-hour plasma exchanges next week.\nShe was diagnosed — by internal medicine chief Dr. Wassim Saad and a crew of medical residents and students — with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder involving both clotting and bleeding that’s so rare the staff in Windsor see it once every several years. Without therapy it’s 95 per cent fatal, and even if you survive you’re likely to suffer from permanent brain damage or kidney failure.\nIt’s caused by a lack of activity in a particular blood protein called the ADAMTS13 enzyme, and it leads to extensive blood clots in the small blood vessels, especially in the brain and kidney, said Bagga. It can also lead to low platelets — clotting cells — which can paradoxically lead to serious bleeding. The results of a full-blown case of the disorder are stroke, kidney failure, fever, and low counts of platelets and red blood cells.\nFreeman’s hemoglobin (red blood) count was 54, when normally it should be 120. And her platelet count was six, when a normal reading is 200 to 300.\nPlasma exchange uses a machine to take blood from a vein heading into the heart. (A special catheter near the heart was installed by interventional radiologist Dr. Jack Speirs and his team.) It takes that blood and spins it rapidly in a centrifuge to separate the whole blood from the plasma, which is the watery component of blood that carries the other blood cells. The patient’s plasma goes into a discharge bag",

A handful of states with relatively low levels of natural gas production or no natural gas production, like Iowa, lack such a measure.\nIn 2012, Wolf’s predecessor, Gov. Tom Corbett, signed into law an updated version of Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act. It included the imposition of a so-called impact fee assessed on new wells, with the resulting revenue distributed to local and state governments to help municipalities \"offset impacts associated with natural gas drilling.\"\nIn June 2017, the Pennsylvania Utility Commission said it had collected and distributed \"more than $1.2 billion in impact fees to communities across Pennsylvania\" over six years.\nReached by email, Erica Wright, vice president of communications and membership with the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade association and lobbying group, pointed back to a previously released statement. It reads, in part, \"since 2012, Pennsylvania’s natural gas impact tax has generated $1.5 billion (and counting) in new revenue. These revenues, which total approximately $200 million annually, directly support communities in every county, as well as key statewide environmental and conservation programs.\"\nThe Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, another industry advocate, also argues that gas drillers pay \"the same taxes as other businesses, PLUS the impact ‘fee’ that NO OTHER businesses pay.\"\nThe point of the ad, Sheridan added by email, is that \"Governor Wolf has taken on lobbyists and special interests to fight for a commonsense severance tax to stop letting oil and gas companies off the hook so they pay their fair share in Pennsylvania.\"\nSheridan continued, \"It’s long past time — Pennsylvania is the only major gas producing state that does not impose a severance tax on oil and gas. States like Texas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma all charge a severance tax, and their natural gas industries continue to thrive.\"\nFor starters, the verbiage — one is a \"fee\" and one is a \"tax.\"\nAccording to StateImpact.org: \"Impact fees are levied on a per-well basis, so each time drillers punch a hole in the ground, they pay. A ‘severance tax’ is applied when resources are severed from the earth, so it would be a tax on the amount of gas produced.\"\nThe Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania said in a 2015 report that the yield for the state would be larger with a severance tax, adding, \"were the severance tax in place for the most recent year, extraction companies would have paid an effective tax rate more than three times the rate they were charged under the impact fee.\"\nIn September, the Pennsylvania State House Energy and Environmental Resources Committee approved an amendment rebranding the existing \"impact fee\" as a \"severance tax.\" Critics called it an act of \"legislative deception\" and an exercise in semantics.

They all knew that Jerry Sandusky was a snake in the grass, a sexual predator of little boys, and all four of them, Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz, Tim Curley and Joe Paterno, closed their eyes, looked the other way and let this horror run unabated for over a decade.\nAnd for that, Penn State University should suffer.\nThe football program should be drawn and quartered. Hung out to dry for the entire world to see. For once, the NCAA should throw down the gauntlet and make the Nittany Lions pay, and pay big, for what they did not do -- and that was protect the 10 boys that Sandusky was convicted of sexually brutalizing, going as far back as 1998. The school then refused to act when accusations of the crimes were initially brought to light.\nThey all lied. And then they all denied.\nThat's why Penn State football has got to be made an example of. The NCAA should conclude that the university committed the worst act of \"lack of institutional control\" imaginable.\nHow can a university not be punished for not acting when one of its assistant football coaches commits the most heinous of crimes? How can a university not be punished when the head football coach knew of these crimes and didn't act to stop them? How can a university not be punished when the highest of officials not only lied about, but also concealed important facts related to the case?\nWhile jail time is likely forthcoming for Curley and Schultz -- both are awaiting trial for failing to report abuse and lying to a grand jury -- and Spanier was fired, that's not enough. It's time for action. Swift, harsh action. Like cutting scholarships. By a third. Whatever the number is, 100, 90, 80 ¦ slice that by 25 or 30 percent and then take that money and donate it to a foundation designed to protect sexually abused children.\nAnother thing, make the Nittany Lions ineligible for bowl games, all bowl games. How about a 10-year ban? No Big Ten playoffs. No postseason bowl. Nothing. Maybe that might help to offset the decade-plus of terror that Sandusky pulled on these young boys.\nBut it probably won't. Nothing will ever make that nightmare go away.\n\"Our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State,\" wrote Louis Freeh, the former FBI director, who was hired by the university to investigate the Sandusky case. \"The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps to protect the children who Sandusky victimized.\"\nThe report, 276 pages long, paints a graphic picture of a university so focused with keeping its reputation intact that there was a massive \"failure of governance,\" according to the report, on the part of university officials and the Penn State board of trustees.\n\"Taking into account the available witness statements and evidence,\" the report said, \"it is more reasonable to conclude that, in order to avoid the consequences of bad publicity, the most powerful leaders at Penn State University repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's child abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"\nOver an eight-month period, Freeh spoke with over 400 current and former Penn State employees, including hundreds associated with the football program. Among the 3.5 million pieces of evidence Freeh went through, he found handwritten notes from Paterno that said not only did he know of Sandusky's behavior but that he was intimately involved with the administration's decision not to tell Pennsylvania child welfare authorities about a 2001 incident when assistant coach Mike McQueary reported to Paterno that he saw Sandusky naked in a shower with a young boy.\nOne of the most chilling paragraphs in the report comes almost at the beginning when Freeh writes: \"The most saddening finding by the Special Investigative Counsel is the total and consistent disregard by the most senior leaders at Penn State for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims. �",

        "prompt": "Anyone who lives in a rain-drenched part of the country can testify to the toll that Mother Nature can take on a home. Rot, mildew and warped wood are just some of the brutalizing effects of wet weather, forcing home owners to repaint or replace siding on an all-too-regular basis.\nBut a growing number of builders are looking to curb the effects of harsh weather with rain screens. Essentially, a rain screen gives up on the notion that a home’s exterior should be watertight, and instead opens up a space between the wall and cladding in order to prevent moisture from getting trapped.\n“A rain screen is trying to create a space between the structural sheeting of the wall and the backside of the siding or finish that is applied to the home in order to allow penetrating water to drain out the bottom,” said Hans Porschitz, head of project management for Bensonwood Homes, a New Hampshire-based homebuilding company that advocates the use of rain screens.\nWhile all rain screen systems employ a space to promote drainage, the actual construction can vary slightly. A builder might use a plastic or glass mesh in the space to offer insulation, while still allowing water to escape.\nNot only can rain screens cut down on exterior rot, they can also improve air quality by eliminating the growth of mold and mildew in the home, a huge benefit for those that suffer from allergies.\nSince a rain screen requires putting extra space between the exterior wall and siding, it is often not possible to add to an existing home. Not only would the existing siding have to be torn off, but the added space would cause the home to have recessed windows and doorways.\n“Retroactively to incorporate it is very expensive because you can’t really slide something in between the siding and the sheeting after,” Porschitz said.\nFortunately, rain screens are becoming a",

        "prompt": "Landry Shamet, Markis McDuffie and Conner Frankamp are all fairly close in minutes, because the Shockers get a great deal of their structure on offense and defense from these three.\nShamet and Frankamp run things and right now there’s not anybody on the bench who provides the same sort of consistency and comfort. McDuffie is the team’s most versatile player, especially when he is focused and under control on offense.\nI’d put the juniors in the next group — Shaq Morris, Zach Brown, Rauno Nurger and Rashard Kelly — for their skills and steady play. Losing any of those four is a blow because of their experience.\nMVC play is challenging Darral Willis and Daishon Smith to different degrees. Freshman Austin Reaves, when healthy, gives WSU a lot in a relatively limited amount of playing time.\nMorris is the player whose minutes are often not correlated to his potential importance. He’s the Shocker big man who can cause opponents the most matchup problems and, when not in foul trouble, make the biggest difference. While he might not rank high in minutes, he might be the one Shocker you’d hate most to lose to a long-term injury.\n@PaulSuellentrop when will Reaves be back?\nUnclear. I’ll ask again today. Reaves has been termed day to day. The fact that he didn’t travel to Wednesday’s game at Drake makes me think it’s unlikely he will play Saturday.\n2). doing well in interviews.\nSee the minutes played for who buys in. Recently, we’ve seen Rashard Kelly and Zach Brown continue to play well by doing a lot of solid, smart things that Marshall demands. The fact that WSU is 20-4 tells me most of the team buys in to a large degree.\nI would think, in that scenario, that the MVC needs Illinois State to win the tournament. While its strength of schedule and RPI are better than WSU’s, Illinois State has three harmful losses — Murray State, Tulsa and San Francisco.\nWSU, in that scenario, has one good win (over Illinois State), but no losses outside the top 50 or the RPI or kenpom.com.\nIf the MVC gets an at-large bid, it will be a sign the bottom of the at-large pool is weak. Neither team has a win over an opponent that is a lock to make the NCAA Tournament, which is a tough way to go. Lunardi’s projection evidently reflects that. Michael Beller at SI.com also has WSU in his last four in. Jerry Palm is dismissive of the Valley’s chances, and he’s not alone.\nIf WSU shows up on March 6 with a 29-5 record, the selection committee will take a hard look. Then it’s up to how other teams finish their conference tournaments.\nWhat might help? The Valley needs teams such as Marquette (2-3 in its last five), Kansas State (2-3) and Iowa State (2-3) to slide. If those type of teams don’t present a strong case, it might help WSU or Illinois State.\n@PaulSuellentrop if we win out til the mvc title game, do u think we get at large birth?\nHow painful would it be to go 29-5, schedule as solidly as WSU did in November and December and not get in? That’s foundation-shaking stuff. I think 29-5 gives WSU a chance. How much of a chance depends on how other teams fare.\n@PaulSuellentrop Willis&#39; minutes way down. What is his role going to be moving into late/post season?\nIf he plays well, he’ll play more minutes. When Morris and Rauno Nurger play well, it affects Willis’ minutes.\nIt wouldn’t surprise me, although I haven’t asked yet, if Willis is worn down a bit (and this may be affecting Daishon Smith). The physical demands are different than in junior college and he doesn’t seem as bouncy as he did a few weeks ago.\nThis is the first time they’ve traveled this much, played this much against equal athletes and worked this much. WSU started in June and added 10 practices to the workload, plus four games, because of its trip to Canada.\nIt was just last week that Willis made 7 of 8 shots and scored 15 points against SIU.\nConference play is a lot about adjusting and adjusting again. There wasn’t as much of a book on Willis in November and December as there is now.\nWhile plenty of people question the talent in the MVC, few question the coaching. Teams are scouting and planning for Willis and faces a lot of double teams. Illinois State might not feel the need to double him as much, so perhaps he can get rolling again.\nOutdoors writer Michael Pearce says watch the migration of ducks and geese. They are heading north now, because of the availability of food. They may come back and return again. Their habits, he says, are the best indicator around.\n@PaulSuellentrop is there any new info regarding WSU, on conference realignment, football, and or the adding of others sports?\nA lot has to happen, much of which rarely happens, so I’d say the chances are not great.\nConferences rarely add a non-football member to a football conference. The American, in the fall, seemed focused on improving its football product to compete with the Power 5, not expansion to help basketball.\nGetting people to speak on the record (or off) is difficult with this topic",

        "prompt": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif. – A state appeals court on Tuesday denied a petition by Scott Peterson&apos;s (search) attorneys who were seeking to overturn a ruling allowing the same jury that convicted Peterson to decide whether he lives or dies for his crimes.\nIn a petition to the 1st District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, attorney Mark Geragos (search) also asked to delay the start of the murder trial&apos;s penalty phase, set to begin Nov. 30, and to schedule a hearing on the issue.\nOn Monday, Judge Alfred A. Delucchi (search) denied the defense motion seeking a new jury in San Mateo County or a new jury somewhere else to decide whether Peterson should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole.\nAfter a five-month trial, Peterson, 32, was convicted Nov. 12 of one count of first-degree murder in the death of his eight-months pregnant wife, Laci, and one count of second-degree murder for the death of her fetus.\nGeragos wanted the high court to decide that Delucchi erred in his ruling, to order the penalty phase moved to another county and to seat a new jury, claiming that, among other things, the jury that found Peterson guilty is now tainted by public opinion.\nGeragos cited a frenzied mob who cheered outside the courthouse as the guilty verdicts were read.\nA three-judge panel of the apppeals court refused to intervene, issuing its denial within hours of the filing. Geragos can now appeal any sentence to same high court. The defense lawyer is expected to seek intervention from the state Supreme Court this week on his request for a delay.\nGeragos also claimed Delucchi wrongly sent jurors home after they reached a verdict instead of keeping the panel sequestered through the penalty phase.\nDaniel Horowitz, a criminal defense attorney and regular Peterson trial observer, predicted the appeals court would not intervene, adding that the move is standard strategy in a death penalty case. Defense attorneys often seek to insert as much time as possible between a guilty verdict and a penalty phase to allow for jurors&apos; emotions to subside.\nGeragos also cited the ousting of two jurors in two days during deliberations, noting that one, the jury&apos;s foreman, told the judge there had been threats to his safety and talk in the jury room of the \"popular verdict, the expected verdict.\" Both ex-jurors remain bound by a gag order.\nGeragos said the foreman asked to be removed because other jurors had become hostile to him and felt his decision would be compromised, according to the defense motion for a new jury filed last week.\n\"When I took the oath, I understood it to mean that I needed to be able to weigh both sides fairly, openly,\" Gregory Jackson told the judge before being removed, according to the defense motion. \"And given what&apos;s transpired, my individual ability to do that, I think, has been compromised to a degree that I would never know personally whether or not I was giving the community&apos;s verdict, the popular verdict, the expected verdict, the verdict that might, I don&apos;t know, produce the best book.\"\nJurors apparently became angered at Jackson&apos;s performance after electing him foreman. His replacement, an easygoing firefighter, told the court that Jackson, a lawyer and medical doctor, \"wanted to talk more than other people, and he tends to take a very long time,\" according to the defense motion.\nIn response, prosecutors said Geragos&apos; filing neglects to mention that Jackson \"completely retracted his claim\" he was pressured by other jurors when he was questioned by the judge.\nThe other juror was removed after she did her own research on the case, disobeying the judge&apos;s orders to consider only the evidence presented at the trial, according to the defense motion.\nIn denying the defense motions for a new jury and a move to another county, Delucchi called the case \"a problem without a solution,\" given the intense media coverage around the country.\nBut Geragos claimed the judge erred by not questioning each juror on the panel before dismissing its foreman.\n\"There&apos;s no requirement that Delucchi talk to every juror,\" Horowitz said, adding that Geragos presented no evidence that other jurors also felt public pressure.\n\"There&ap",

        "prompt": "Foursquare, Google Latitude and Facebook Nearby Friends failed to change the way we all meet up. That’s because intent, not location, is the most important thing when connecting people offline. If we want to meet up for food, coffee, drinks, the gym, a party or just to chill, it’s tough to know who else does too. It doesn’t matter if a friend is a block away if they can’t or don’t want to hang out. Always-on location sharing still freaks some of us out, and can drain battery life.\nBut the typical approach of calling, texting or posting on social media to see who’s available is broken too. You look desperate constantly badgering friends or broadcasting too widely asking to get together. The silence is deafening when no one responds. You feel uncool. Spraying push notifications at too large an audience or painstakingly choosing who to ping is discouraging.\nAnd like chat apps, products dedicated to aiding us assemble friends offline only really work if they achieve a level of ubiquity. If a few of your best buddies aren’t there, it’s pretty useless and you might as well resort to direct messaging.\nThat’s what kept Free from gaining traction, and fast-growing Down To Lunch has been criticized for unwanted invites. Because people are often only available to get together with friends a few times a week, it’s hard to achieve consistent use of a standalone app that drives growth instead of churn. Plus, if we’re not already looking there for another reason, people undecided about whether they’re trying to congregate can’t be seduced.\nThis is why Facebook Messenger and Snapchat are better primed to succeed at “gathering” than anyone else.\nIt’s an extraordinarily tough product to design right. But they have the reach (at least amongst the most social age group), style of product and sociology savvy to nail it. The question is if either can.\nThe only time I ever tried to build a company, it was to build this. The app was called Signal. We failed and shut down. There was too much friction to showing intent with wordy plans, it was impractical to constantly be annoying friends with pleas to see them and we couldn’t get people’s whole offline social graph to sign up.\nI’m not the only one who gave it a shot. There was Y Combinator president Sam Altman’s original startup Loopt. Facebook acquired both Gowalla and Glancee, two more attempts. Oh, and then there’s Banjo, Sonar, FacesIn and a dozen more that imploded.\nImagine if instead of just an online availability indicator, we had an “I want to meet up” offline availability indicator.\nTap a button, and your friends in your city or a subset of them could see you’re interested in socializing in the physical world. It’d last a few hours or until you turned it off, and could optionally include what you’re in the mood for. Your closest friends might get notified, but you wouldn’t necessarily have to alert them.\nFacebook Messenger has a whole People tab that’s hardly put to use. It shows your “favorite” friends to chat with, but they’re probably already near the top of your home tab list of chat threads. Yet its role as the top Western messaging app means people are opening it dozens of times per day.\nMessenger’s People tab could display your intent to hang out and you’d be one tap away from starting a chat thread to plan your rendezvous. And since it would just need general location and your explicit approval to function, not always-on exact location that is implicitly broadcast, it wouldn’t need the scary privacy opt out that cut down usage of Facebook Nearby Friends.\nIt’d be a little tougher to shoehorn the feature into Snapchat. There could be room on the Chat or Stories pages. Snapchat’s intense usage amongst teens and college kids with tons of free time to spend with friends could give an offline intent indicator enough visibility.\nBoth social networks want you to share more of your personal lives on their apps. Creating content that’s compelling and doesn’t seem awkward is a lot easier when you’re with friends. They’re your co-stars, your muses and your guides to experience. Becoming the app that fuels these offline meetups might make them the place to share the results.\nI believe this space is eventually destined for a winner, whether it’s Facebook, Snapchat or some startup like Down To Lunch. We get too much joy out of being with friends for the problem of separation to go unsolved. And",

        "prompt": "Moments remains in its infancy, but could emerge alongside Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram as a core mobile app for the social network.\nFacebook's (NASDAQ:FB) mobile app is one of the most popular in the world. More than 1 billion people use Facebook on their mobile devices each and every day. But there's more to Facebook than its core social network.\nThe company has an increasingly impressive array of other apps, each boasting hundreds of millions of additional users in their own right. Collectively, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram reach 2.3 billion people each month, mostly through mobile devices. WhatsApp and Messenger lead the way with 1 billion and 900 million monthly actives, respectively; Instagram adds 400 million. The company has tried many times to add a fifth to that lineup, but most of its initiatives have been outright failures. Last year, Facebook discontinued Slingshot, Riff, and Rooms after they failed to gain sufficient traction.\nBut Facebook has one up-and-coming app that may hold considerably more promise: Moments, a photo-centric app Facebook launched last year, has remained one of the more popular apps in the app store since its debut.\nMoments is fundamentally a photo-sharing app, but not in a social networking sort of way. Moments is instead designed to make it easier to send private photos to friends.\nSay you and a friend both attend a party, during which you each take more than a dozen photos. The photos you took are on your phone, while the photos they took are on theirs. There are several ways you two could exchange them, including email, text message, or, if you both use iPhones, AirDrop. But these methods can be cumbersome, and perhaps too complicated for some users. Enter Moments: With Facebook's app, you can send entire catalogues of photos to your friends with a just a few taps.\nIt took Moments a few months to catch on, but by last fall it had emerged as one of more popular free apps in the app store, and has held relatively steady ever since. It's currently the 55th-most popular free app on the iTunes App Store, just behind familiar staples Chrome, Lyft, and Skype.\nIts popularity has been increasing in recent months. In February, Facebook announced that Moments users had shared more than 400 million photos since last June, with 100 million of those shared in February (via TechCrunch). Facebook has added additional features to Moments to make it more attractive, including the ability to share videos, and has also punished users unwilling to download it. In January, it removed support for automatic photo syncing on its core Facebook app, sticking it in the Moments app instead. Those that still want to use the feature must rely on Moments.\nAs it currently stands, Moments doesn't have any true direct competitors, but in time, it could become the go-to solution for photo management, at least among Facebook users. That could put it in direct competition with other photo apps, most notably Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Photos. Like Moments, Google Photos allows users to sort and share their photos, but also doubles as a free cloud-backup solution. Moments doesn't offer much in the way of cloud storage, but with its Facebook integration, it excels in terms of sharing.\nMoments and Google Photos also share a reliance on artificial intelligence. Each service includes a heavy machine learning component, through which they automatically scan, sort, and categorize images. Google Photos users can search for concepts such as \"cat\", \"screenshot\", or \"Florida\" and see relevant images from the photos they've taken. Moments lacks the complex search of Google Photos, but automatically categorizes photos based on the faces of the people in them. And if you're friends with them on Facebook, you'll automatically be prompted to share.\nDuring Facebook's most recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about the company's efforts in artificial intelligence, and cited Moments as a notable example.\n\"Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us, but we",

He expanded his target to Alan Greenspan (search), saying the Federal Reserve chairman \"has become too political\" and should be replaced.\nThe onetime front-runner, seeking to rally his sagging campaign by casting himself as a Washington outsider, criticized Greenspan as he assailed President Bush&apos;s tax cut, arguing that they were geared to benefit the wealthy.\n\"I think Alan Greenspan has become too political,\" Dean said. \"If he lacks the political courage to criticize the deficit, if he was foolish enough — and he&apos;s not a foolish man — to support the outrageous tax cut that George Bush put through then he has become too political and we need a new chairman of the Federal Reserve.\"\nGreenspan&apos;s term as chairman ends in June, but Bush has said he will nominate him for a fifth four-year term.\nDean criticized Greenspan and Washington politicians within days of the New Hampshire primary.\n\"Listen to what they say. You can have middle-class tax cuts. You can have health care for every American ... you can help every American go to college. Do you believe that?\" Dean asked a crowd of 200 people at a town hall outside of Manchester.\nThe former Vermont governor did not name his opponents for the nomination but clearly had them in mind when he told the crowd it was time to stand up to President Bush and Republican polices.\n\"We&apos;re not going to do this by nominating a Washington insider,\" Dean said as he accused other politicians of giving voters \"blather at election time.\"\nThree of Dean&apos;s chief opponents for the nomination serve in the Senate — John Kerry, John Edwards and Joe Lieberman.

        "prompt": "Kansas legislators have ended their special session after passing an education funding plan aimed at satisfying a court mandate and averting a threat that the state's public schools might shut down.\nThe Senate adjourned at about 8:20 p.m. Friday, and the House followed about 30 minutes later.\nRepublican Gov. Sam Brownback called the GOP-dominated Legislature into session to respond to a state Supreme Court order last month.\nThe court said the state's education funding system remained unfair to poor school districts despite three revisions of school finance laws in the past three years. The justices had warned that schools would not be able to reopen after this month if lawmakers didn't make more changes.\nThe governor and lawmakers expect the plan to satisfy the court.\nThe Kansas House has approved an education funding plan from Republican leaders that would boost aid to poor school districts to satisfy a state Supreme Court mandate and end a threat that the state's public schools might not reopen next month.\nThe vote Friday night was 116-6 on a bill that would increases aid to poor school districts by $38 million for 2016-17 by diverting money from other parts of state government.\nA Senate vote also was expected Friday night. Its approval would send the bill to Gov. Sam Brownback.\nTop Republicans in the Kansas Legislature have rewritten their education funding plan.\nThe plan unveiled Friday boosts aid to poor school districts by $38 million, just as a previous plan from Republican leaders did. It redistributes some funds from wealthier districts to meet a Kansas Supreme Court mandate to make the education funding system fairer to poor districts.\nIt does not rely as heavily on reshuffling of existing education dollars as the previous plan. Instead, it dedicates funds from the planned sale of assets of the Kansas Bioscience Authority to cover up to $13 million of the aid to poor schools. The authority was set up a decade ago to nurture Bioscience businesses.\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved the plan and the full House planned to debate it later Friday.\nA school funding plan from Republican legislative leaders is going back to committee in the Kansas House for potential changes.\nHouse Speaker Ray Merrick reassigned the bill Friday to the Appropriations Committee only a day after the panel approved it. GOP leaders faced dissention among Republicans over how to pay for a $38 million increase in aid to poor school districts for 2016-17.\nLegislators were in the second day of a special session to address a state Supreme Court ruling last month. The justices said the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor districts.\nThe GOP leader's plan decreases aid already promised to 141 of the state's 286 school districts to help poor ones. Critics say the Supreme Court wouldn't accept such a reshuffling of existing education dollars.\nThe Kansas Senate has rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have prevented the state's courts from closing schools in deciding future education funding lawsuits.\nThe vote Friday was 26-13, one vote short of the 27 needed for a two-thirds majority to pass a constitutional change.\nThe measure was a response to a state Supreme Court ruling last month declaring that the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor school districts. The justices warned schools might not reopen after June 30 if lawmakers didn't make changes.\nCritics said the proposal was designed to handcuff the courts.\nBut supporters said future school closure threats need to be eliminated. The proposal also would have prevented legislators from closing schools in response to a court order.\nModerate Republicans in the Kansas House have modified their plan for meeting a state Supreme Court mandate on education funding to make it more palatable to fellow lawmakers.\nRepublican Rep. Melissa Rooker of Fairway said a proposal to divert $6 million in unused economic development funds to public schools has been dropped because of potential opposition. Some Republicans have argued that the move would stymie job creation.\nRooker said the plan would instead divert existing education dollars set aside for school's emergency needs to boost aid for poor school districts. The moderate GOP plan still would tap $9 million in motor vehicle fees.\nThey're all elements of a plan to increase aid to poor school districts by $38 million for 2016-17 to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling last month.\nThe Kansas Senate is debating a proposed constitutional amendment that would prevent the state's courts from closing schools in deciding future education funding lawsuits.\nRepublican leaders expected the Senate to vote on the measure Friday. A two-thirds majority was needed for passage.\nThe proposal is a response to a state Supreme Court ruling last month declaring that the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor school districts. The justices warned schools might not reopen after June 30 if lawmakers didn't make changes.\nThe measure also would prevent legislators from closing schools in response to a court order. Supporters said future school closure threats need to be eliminated. Critics said the proposal is designed to handcuff the courts.\nIf lawmakers pass the measure, it goes on the ballot in November.\nA problem with the Kansas House's sound system has forced state workers to bring in a substitute piece of equipment.\nWhen the House's staff arrived Friday morning, a big speaker in the chamber was making a loud popping noise every six seconds. The same problem occurred briefly Thursday morning when lawmakers convened a special session on education funding.\nHouse leaders turned the speaker off and warned members to keep side conversations down because it would be harder to hear any debates.\nWorkers then removed a speaker from the Statehouse's largest committee room, hooked it into the House's system and stood it up on a table next to the ailing speaker in the House chamber, securing it with long Velcro strips.\nAn attorney representing four Kansas school districts suing the state says he believes legislators would satisfy a state Supreme Court education-funding mandate by passing a plan from moderate Republicans rather than one backed by GOP leaders.\nLawyer John Robb said Friday that the plan circulated by Republican Rep. Melissa Rooker of Fairway appears to be \"good to go\" because it avoids reshuffling a small part of the state's existing aid to school districts to help the poorer ones.\nGOP leader's plan redistributes $13 million in aid for general operations in all",

In addition, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revised downward the loss of jobs in July to 1,100 from an initial posting of 600.\nAs a result, job gains over the year were a weak 6,000.\n\"It's not good news. It's very disappointing news,\" said Peter Gioia, the economist for the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, the state's largest business advocacy group.\nConnecticut's unemployment rate fell by two-tenths of a point to 4.8 percent in August. The U.S. unemployment rate last month was 4.4 percent.\nConnecticut's jobless rate is the highest among the six New England states.\nThe jobs report coincided with the legislature's expected approval of a state budget Thursday that would end a 10-week stalemate. The previous fiscal year ended June 30.\nGioia said the job losses should have pressured lawmakers to send a budget to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy that does not signal to business a \"wrong message\" of higher taxes or fiscal instability.\nLegislators were aware of the August jobs report, he said.\n\"We're making sure they are\" aware of the job losses, Gioia said.\nThe three-month average job gain in Connecticut is nearly flat.

        "prompt": "Registered nurses (RNs) are charged with providing a broad range of care for patients. They may work in a hospital setting, in a doctor’s office, a surgery center, nursing home or in an assisted care facility. Some RNs also work in corporate medicine as school nurses, at community health centers, in home health or in the military. Although the individual industries that RNs work in often dictate appropriate goals, elevating the standard of care for all patients while also taking professional career inventory should be top priorities.\nOften, registered nurses are responsible for attending to multiple patients during a single shift. Often, time is spread thin, so an important goal is to operate in the most efficient way possible. This might include improving time-management and multi- tasking skills, delegating more, as needed, and performing routine tasks in a highly organized manner. Ultimately, the outcome of this goal should be to have a completed shift in which all critical tasks are completed by the time of hand-off to the incoming shift. Ongoing professional development and participation in specialized training programs and professional workshops can help with this effort.\nWhile maintaining efficiency, RNs must be diligent and accurate in everything they accomplish. Goals in this area should include an in-depth understanding of intake, charting, vital sign assessment, as well as in discharge orders and instructions. Tools for measuring whether these goals are being met might include improved statistics on patient response time, or a reduction in reported errors. As different medical settings use different types of processes and procedures from each other, having a goal of an RN in a new setting should be that she should familiarize herself with the best practices specific to that facility.\nAt the heart of an RN's key duties is patient care. Often, time constraints may reduce the amount of time that nurses spend with individual patients, particularly when it comes to non-emergent issues, such as comfort care. A goal for improving patient care could include dedicating \"X\" number of minutes per patient, per shift, for providing comfort measures; assigning certified nursing assistants to perform this function; or, introducing trained, vetted volunteer staff to help non-medical, non-critical patient interaction.\nRegistered nurses frequently interact with, delegate and direct",

        "prompt": "Cooks hustled around the kitchen at Cheney High School on Wednesday preparing a vegetarian lunch feast: fresh salad dressings, hot potato wedges, baked macaroni and cheese, roasted cauliflower and lentil soup.\nThe food service workers from five small regional school districts had gathered at Cook for America’s weeklong Culinary Boot Camp where participants learn techniques to make healthy, from-scratch food at or below the same price as processed food. “We call them lunch teachers because we want to reinforce that’s what they are there to do,” said Kate Adamick, Cook for America co-founder.\nFrom-scratch cooking has been a success in the Cheney School District. Since making the switch two years ago using a grant from Empire Health Foundation, the district has seen savings in its lunch program of about $3,200 a year and a drop in obesity rates among children. And, school officials say, kids love the food.\nGoing healthy hasn’t been as successful in many larger school districts, for reasons including the cost of new equipment, training and additional labor.\nChanges to the federal school lunch program inspired school districts to look at their approach to nutrition. In the past, many used quick, easy processed foods. The 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act aimed to change that. The law requires schools to serve more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and less sodium.\nMany districts are saying the changes have been too expensive and students have quit eating school lunches. Districts across the nation are asking for relief.\nThe national School Nutrition Association, which is made up of thousands of school kitchen workers, think schools should be granted waivers from the federal law because the cost of using more fruits and vegetables is too high. Many districts also report that the healthier food goes to waste, as students refuse to eat it. At Spokane Public Schools, for example, 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables served to students go into the garbage, said Doug Wordell, nutrition services director.\nParticipation in the National School",

        "prompt": "The standard operating procedure of the May government is to outsource immigration enforcement to the public, embedding borders in all sorts of different aspects of our day-to-day life. One of the chief ways it does this is through the 'right-to-rent' scheme, which is a far more dangerous development than it sounds. Now we finally have an independent assessment of the operation, via David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.\nThe right-to-rent scheme places a legal requirement on landlords and their agents to carry out immigration checks on all adults who will occupy a property before they enter into a tenancy agreement. The punishment for those who fail to do this are very severe. They face a civil penalty of up to £3,000 and a possible prison sentence of up to five years.\nBolt's inspection report, carried out throughout 2017, paints a stark picture of a scheme that is causing real harm to migrants - both documented and undocumented - people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and society at large. It appears to be being implemented with no meaningful oversight or monitoring whatsoever and is not even achieving its stated aim of reducing or controlling immigration.\nOver the three years since the scheme was first piloted, several migrant rights groups have raised concerns about the harm caused by this policy, including in homelessness, exploitation, and racial discrimination. The report suggests that they were entirely correct to do so.\nA number of organisations told Bolt that there was \"significant concern\" about increased homelessness resulting from right-to-rent. Local authorities have reported \"an increase in families applying for support\".\nHomeless charity Crisis raised concerns that the policy offered \"the potential for rogue landlords to perform illegal evictions, as there is no judicial oversight of the eviction process\". Meanwhile, rights afforded to tenants were removed in other pieces of legislation. They warned that the creation of landlords acting as border guards would prevent tenants \"from reporting and seeking local authority assistance with bad landlords or unsafe properties\".\nThe Migrant Rights Network gave evidence that many tenants were being forced into 'informal' accommodation where they were \"vulnerable to exploitation and abuse\". The Home Office's own evaluation of the pilot phase of the scheme confirmed these concerns, noting that \"the more exploitative end of the sector could increase as a result of the right-to-rent scheme\".\nResearch on the right-to-rent scheme by several migrant rights groups found evidence of increased racial discrimination against tenants. In truth, ethnic minority renters in the UK already face racial discrimination, but the policy is set to make it worse.\nAlmost half (42%) of landlords are now less likely to rent to someone without a British passport, which includes 17% of British nationals. Similar numbers said they would be less likely to rent to people who had the right to rent but were on a non-permanent visa or had documents the landlord was unfamiliar with. There is no mechanism for someone who believes they have suffered discrimination from a landlord to report it to the Home Office. They don't want to know.\nIt is clear that the government is not interested in monitoring the scheme, either in terms of performance or unintended outcomes.\nThe Home Office did complete an evaluation of the pilot phase prior to the wider roll-out, but they conceded that the decision to go ahead had, in effect, already been taken.\nThe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) told inspectors that the stakeholder body set up by the Home Office had no \"data gathering or evaluation function\" and would therefore be unable to properly monitor the scheme. It has not met since November 2016.\nFollowing a meeting with the Home Office last year, JCWI told Bolt that they \"remain deeply concerned that no robust or adequate system for monitoring and evaluating the scheme's operation and measuring its success, cost-effectiveness and proportionality has been put in place, nor is there any plan to do so\".\nThere is no evidence the policy is succeeding in its stated aim of ensuring people leave the country and in fact there is considerable evidence that it is failing.\nSince the introduction of the scheme the number of 'voluntary' returns has not increased. In fact, it has fallen. Over an 18 month period, there were 9,127 users of the government's voluntary returns scheme. Only seven of them cited their inability to rent property as a reason for wishing to leave the UK.\nIn response, officials told Bolt that it is \"important to think of the compliant environment measures as a 'suite' rather than trying to assess them individually\".\nWe should take them at their word. Assessing the hostile environment policies together, what have they accomplished?",

Hodor from \"Game of Thrones,\" had been planned as a guest at Universal FanCon.\nA week before crowds of self-proclaimed proud geeks were scheduled to gather at Universal FanCon in the Baltimore Convention Center, organizers abruptly postponed the event.\nBilled as the “first multi-fandom Con dedicated to inclusion, highlighting Women, LGBTQ, the Disabled and Persons of Color,” the event was supposed to run from April 27 to April 29.\nBefore the announcement, the convention had planned guests such as Kristian Nairn, a.k.a. Hodor from “Game of Thrones,” actor Mehcad Brooks of “Supergirl,” and more.\nEven in the superhero universe, representation matters — especially to Baltimore.\nThe last-minute announcement left fans scrambling to cancel flights and hotel rooms and recoup the money they’d spent to prepare for the convention. Many said they were frustrated and angry — not just because the event was canceled, but because of the lack of communication from event planners.\nIt also means lost business for Baltimore hotels and restaurants and a large weekend vacancy at the city’s convention center on a prime spring weekend. Officials from Visit Baltimore could not be reached for comment Saturday.\nThe convention organizers did not respond to a request for comment, but apologized on Twitter to the people who were looking forward to the event, particularly those who already booked flights and rooms, and requested time off from work.\nIn their statement, organizers said they tried to supplement the insufficient funds by making “significant personal investments” and scaling back the convention to “create a leaner and more efficient show.” They also raised more than $56,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to help finance the show.\nThe convention has been two years in the making, with the stated goal of providing an event that “fosters true inclusion, diversity, and safety,” organizers wrote on their website.\nIt was supposed to have been a star-studded event, with planned appearances from Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor from HBO’s “Game of Thrones;” actor Mehcad Brooks of “Supergirl;” actor and comedian Orlando Jones of “American Gods;” “Star Wars” actor Billy Dee Williams; Grammy-winning artist Big Daddy Kane; and Kim Chi, a former contestant of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” according to a news release.\nIn response to frequent questions about refunds, organizers said they will honor people’s tickets whenever the convention is rescheduled.\nMany on Twitter complained that organizers bungled the announcement about the postponement. People who had made hotel reservations within a specific block of rooms received room cancellation emails from the hotel before organizers put out any official information.\nSandy Rosenblatt of Rockville bought a ticket to the Universal FanCon as a 44th birthday present to herself. She found out via Twitter on Friday that the event she was looking forward to — and had spent $300 on — was canceled. She said she didn’t get an official confirmation from the event organizers until Saturday afternoon.\n“There was a professional way to have done this and I don’t think that’s what they did,” Rosenblatt said.\nRosenblatt said she’s left thinking about how the $300 she used on FanCon could have been better spent on groceries, rent or paying back debt.\n“It�",

However, Disney is aiming to give the story its biggest blockbuster production yet, with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms gearing up for production. Last month, dancer Misty Copeland was the first star to be added to the movie, but now there's word that Interstellar actress Mackenzie Foy has been brought aboard as the movie's lead actress.\nAccording to Variety, Foy has been cast as Clara, the girl who is given a Nutcracker doll by her parents which later comes to life and takes its owner to a magical kingdom on a journey to defeat the evil Mouse King. While The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is primarily based on the original 1816 story, the use of Clara as the protagonist shows there will also be elements of the ballet incorporated into the movie.\nMackenzie Foy is arguably best known for playing young Murph Cooper in 2014's Interstellar, with Jessica Chastain playing the character as an adult. Foy also appeared in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2 as Renesmee Cullen, and she can be heard next month as The Little Girl in Netflix's The Little Prince.\nSo now The Nutcracker and the Four Realms has its main star, but she isn't the only casting that's been announced.

In the ballet, Drosselmeyer was Clara's godfather, and he was the one who created the Nutcracker for her. Whether that same relationship will be retained in the movie remains to be seen, but with Freeman on board, this movie has some major Hollywood power behind it. Freeman's recent appearances include Ted 2, London Has Fallen, Now You See Me 2 and next month's Ben-Hur remake.\n",

Shawn Joseph is director of schools.\nThe conversations surrounding our city’s public school system are persistent, and at times emotionally charged.\nThe four of us wanted to take this moment to express that we are committed to working together in support of one another while ensuring Nashville becomes the highest achieving urban school district in the country.\nThis goal is ambitious. Some might find it unrealistic in light of certain metrics which are far from satisfactory.\nFor example, recently released data shows that MNPS is moving faster than the state and nation on third through eighth grade reading, but despite those gains, we are still far from where we want to be.\nAnd, certainly the news on Friday that we now have six more schools on the state’s Priority Schools List (those performing in the bottom 5 percent in the state) — from 15 to 21 — is deeply disappointing.\nWe can – and must – do better.\nWhile those headlines are deflating, we cannot settle for quick fixes where the performance is fleeting. There is too much at stake.\nWhat we are seeking is a transformation of learning in every classroom in every school for the benefit of every student entrusted to us by their parents through a covenant we are not willing to compromise.\nBut we will only succeed if we find a way to bicker less and instead work together to equitably address historic challenges of underfunding of our public schools.\nIn the same way that we have come together around early literacy – resourced the need and forged strong public/private partnerships to fasten the pace of the work, we must now do that more broadly to accelerate progress in underperforming schools.\nOur work on the Blueprint for Early Childhood Success is the envy of and a model for school districts nationwide; we now must build on that model more broadly.\nResults will not materialize overnight. But, much work is already underway, successes are revealed every day, and the groundwork is in place on many fronts for the reversal of results that are unsatisfactory by anyone’s standards.\nThis includes the extraordinary work by teachers and principals across the district who work tirelessly every day to help their students achieve their full potential.\nIndeed, amidst the bad news we often read are stories of great success – schools and teachers getting terrific results for kids. We must learn more about those bright spots and help share and scale their lessons learned citywide.\nWe appreciate that no issue facing our city is the singular domain of one institution.\nRather, matters such as public education are a concern for the entire community.\nDebating matters about how to improve our schools is productive, but only when it is grounded in mutual respect, and an appreciation for joint creativity.",

Since its launch five years ago, the Austin-based apparel line has operated as a women-led, inclusive, sustainably sourced, and ethically manufactured clothing line. With a mission such as this, MBS's effortlessly chic pieces are merely an added bonus.\nLed by Miranda Bennett, the company's owner, designer, and namesake, MBS is expanding from online and pop-up shops to a brick-and-mortar at 1211 E. 11th St., Ste. 101, beginning November 17, a move Bennett says is about more than expanding retail access.\n\"It will serve as a sanctuary,\" she says. \"Our store will exist as a place of discovery, where we can educate our customer about our process and where they can see and feel the entire MBS collection, as well as the artisans whose work we wish to highlight.\"\nThe same aesthetic and penchant for thoughtfulness that has turned MBS into a cult favorite among fans and fashion houses alike will extend to the new brick-and-mortar.\nMBS tapped local architecture firm Side Angle Side to design the space while KKDW, the Texas Hill Country design and fabricator shop, handcrafted the millwork from local pecan. True to form, the MBS team will create the store's upholstery using KKDW's leftover pecan shavings to dye the fabric.\n\"The second you walk through our doors, you will know where you are,\" says Bennett. \"[The space] will be a floor-to-ceiling tribute to our story, our apparel, and our partnerships.\"\nThe culture created outside of those doors, however, is what ultimately led the company to this milestone.
