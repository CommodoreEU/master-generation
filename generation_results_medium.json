Credit: Perkins & Co.\nHigh atop Burnaby Mountain stands a housing solution that could unlock one of the thorniest problems facing Vancouver and other expensive B.C. cities: Where to house the students, artists and other working singles who are critical to creating an information-based economy.\nThe City of Burnaby may be the first municipality in the world to legalize secondary suites within apartments -- also called lock-off suites -- that enable owners of condominiums to do what owners of houses have done for decades: rent out extra space.\n\"Basement suites provide the most affordable housing in the Lower Mainland,\" said architect and planner Michael Geller. \"Some of these basement suites are legal; most are not. Some remain as rental housing in perpetuity; others are taken over by the homeowner as family size increases, or family finances improve.\"\nA longtime advocate of Flex Housing, Geller was president of the SFU Community Trust during the development of UniverCity, a planned community of up to 4,500 homes on 200 acres adjacent to Simon Fraser University.\n\"Both the university and the City of Burnaby wanted to provide some affordable housing for students within the community. However, the university did not want to use high value land for student housing, especially since it might \"de-value\" the adjacent condominium sites,\" Geller explained.\n\"So the question we asked ourselves was: Why not create the equivalent of a basement suite in a fifth-floor apartment?\" he said.\n\"The answer came from resort architecture. We've all been in a hotel room or suite where, through a series of interlocking doors, two individual rooms can be joined as one suite,\" Geller said.\nAfter considerable negotiation, the City of Burnaby amended its bylaws to approve lock-off suites within up to half of the apartments and townhomes at UniverCity. The suites must be at least 240 square feet. They are permitted to have their own entry from the corridor, as well as their own bathroom and cooking facilities.\n\"When we initially thought of this concept, we expected these suites would be the third bedroom in a three-bedroom unit,\" Geller said. \"However, the first units to be built were in fact two bedroom units, where the second bedroom could either be the master bedroom, or a separate suite.\"\n\"I am quite certain that nowhere else in North America -- or for that matter, in the world -- has another municipality developed a specific zoning bylaw to govern suites within apartments,\" Geller said. \"Burnaby did it in 2002. And Vancouver is looking into it now.\"\nThe Burnaby Mountain lock-off suites are not \"affordable\" in the strictest sense.\nIn fact, Geller figures they cost between $20,000 and $30,000 more than the same-sized unit with ensuite bathrooms but without lock-off capability. Included in this amount is the extra door to the corridor, more fire-proofing between living quarters, an additional electrical panel and wiring, and parking.\n\"In order to increase affordability, the city agreed that it would relax its normal parking requirements,\" Geller said. \"Only one space was provided for every four secondary suites.\"\nBut the existence of the lock-off suites -- and, specifically, the prospect of their rental income -- has made these relatively expensive apartments more purchase-able, because lenders have regarded a portion of the anticipated rent as income.\n\"This allows a young family to get into the suite they might not otherwise afford. And later, when kids need their own room, they can take over the whole suite,\" Geller said.\n\"Some people would argue that costs inherent in making a home flexible are too great,\" Geller said. \"Particularly recognizing that, at least in North America, we have a propensity to move quite frequently. Others might argue that our propensity to move is a result of the fact that our homes can't change as our needs change.\"\nThe lock-off suites have not proven cheap to rent, either. These tiny bachelor suites -- ranging in size from 240 to 285 square feet -- fetch from $525 to $750 per month.\n\"They rented for much more than I expected,\" Geller said. \"Still, they rent for considerably less than for a conventional one-bedroom suite.\"\nBut while the rents are quite high on a per-foot basis, these tiny suites are cheaper than almost anything other than a substandard basement suite or an aging residential hotel.\nThis may prove to be the lock-off suite's greatest advantage: It serves the most extremely under-served gap in British Columbia's expensive urban rental markets.\nIn Vancouver, newly built or recently renovated one-bedroom apartments in walkable neighbourhoods rent for about $1,200 a month. Basement suites fetch $750. And a bug-infested room in an aging residential hotel runs to almost $600 a month -- if one can be found.\nThis leaves students, artists, and other young singles priced out of the market. It also serves as a profound disincentive for the province's tens of thousands of mentally ill and frequently addicted citizens to better",

        "prompt": "‘Multi-tasking Writ Large’: Is American Health Care Reform a Prescription for Trouble?\nUsing two decades of data, Wharton health care professors Lawton R. Burns and Mark V. Pauly recently dissected the cost-cutting component of the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While the title of their research paper, published in Health Affairs, was \"Accountable Care Organizations May Have Difficulty Avoiding the Failures of Integrated Delivery Networks of the 1990s,\" the authors had offered another, shorter title: \"Doomed to Fail?\"\nBurns and Pauly have teamed up before. In 2002, they analyzed health care initiatives in President Clinton's first administration that failed to become law. Subsequent books and articles looked at integrated delivery networks (IDNs), Clinton-era precursors to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). The new article compares current Obamacare ACO delivery models to IDNs in the 1990s in terms of their ability (or inability) to improve health care quality and lower costs.\nIn their day, IDNs attempted to coordinate physicians, hospitals, disease management programs and care delivery in alternative sites, but in looser arrangements than formal health maintenance organizations. Hospitals bought primary care physicians' practices and formed a variety of joint venture IDNs with doctors in an effort to gain leverage over insurers in negotiations keyed to per capita payments — an actuarially-based fixed fee per registered patient in lieu of fees for each physician service. However, IDNs failed to secure capitated contracts from payers and were unable to convince doctors to change the way they practiced, even when they employed them. IDNs were faulted for rewarding the volume of medical treatment rather than results, driving costs up with little regard to the quality of patient care. They eventually incurred substantial financial losses and closed down.\nThe Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are similar to IDNs in their attempts to integrate care as a way to cut costs and improve quality. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) — which serves as the payer for Medicare and Medicaid as well as a clearinghouse for guidance on health care infrastructure — last year released proposed rules for establishing ACOs made up of hospitals, doctors and other health care providers as a blueprint for this coordinated care initiative. Medicare will offer incentive payments to ACOs that are able to improve quality of care while eliminating redundant costs.\nBurns and Pauly aren't convinced that ACOs are the answer. While their data centers on Medicare, it has implications that apply to the whole health care sector. \"In this article, we ask how the current proposals differ from the earlier failed models,\" Burns and Pauly write in their paper, \"and whether any of the differences are large enough to yield better results this time.\" Their conclusions suggest that the dismal track record of Clinton era IDNs bodes ill for new reforms centered around ACOs.\nTheir research began after Burns accepted an invitation to speak about ACOs to alumni of the Kellogg School at Northwestern University. \"I didn't go in with a point of view,\" Burns says. \"I stumbled into it.\" In January 2011, he was wrapping up an extended focus on India's health care system for a global modular course he taught at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad,and was not focusing on health care developments in the U.S.\nThen, ahead of the Kellogg talk in May 2011, Burns spent three months boning up on ACOs, considered to be linchpins in the argument that government can afford to extend health care to millions of uninsured Americans because it will, at the same time, be able to reap billions of dollars in cost savings. In care coordination, disease management and health information technology, Burns soon realized it was déjà vu all over again. \"I began to recognize all these things we had talked about [regarding] the Clinton health care reform\" effort, says Burns. The more he looked, the more he saw that Obamacare was relying on money-saving outcomes that hadn't worked in the past.\nPauly, adding an economist's perspective to Burns' behaviorist view, agrees with this pessimistic appraisal of the current health care reform initiatives. \"So far in the natural evolution of the ACO concept,\" says Pauly, \"it does not seem that it will put pieces together in the right way.\" He gives two chief reasons. First, the only entities with enough organization, cash and clout to steer health care toward desired ends are hospitals, whose responsibility in general is to treat sick people. Keeping a whole population healthy is an altogether different goal, and requires brand new roles and systems, Pauly says.\nThe second reason looks intractable. For decades, health care has eluded heroic efforts to cut costs. Researchers constantly ask why the market's invisible hand does not demand efficiency in the health sector, as it does in most other sectors that cater to consumers. Hospitals that sought efficiencies in the 1990s seldom reduced costs, in part because physicians operated with separate, sometimes competing agendas. \"Nobody has figured out how to get doctors to work and play well with hospitals,\" Pauly says. Geographic distance between hospitals and doctors' offsite medical groups underscored diverging interests.\nBurns blames a lack of overall ownership of the health care system. Instead, it is crowded with stakeholders whose divergent interests add up to an administrative puzzle that no one has the power to solve. Health care reform as conceived requires too much from all stakeholders at once, says Burns, a case of \"multi-tasking writ large.\" What's more, half of the money comes from the federal government. \"You are not going to have efficient markets,\" Burns says, \"when government is a big payer and the price setter.\"\nUntil hospital CEOs gain authority to compel all actors in the health care delivery system, doctors included, to behave in a cost efficient manner, Pauly sees little chance for meaningful cost reduction. Experts describe this conundrum as \"competing agency costs\" and other formal-sounding terms, but Burns adopts a more succinct explanation. \"One person's costs are another person's income,\" Burns says. By that, he means cutting Medicare cost lowers income for doctors, a stubborn dynamic that impedes progress in health care.\nOther obstacles hamper efforts to lower health care costs. Not-for-profit hospitals lack the drive to keep costs low and profit margins healthy. If a doctor trims hospital costs, he or she seldom enjoys a direct benefit. Consumers lack incentive to police costs so long as Medicare or insurers pick up the tab. Worse, insured consumers usually choose the most expensive option where their health is concerned. To restrain costs, insurers introduced capitation payment in lieu of the traditional fee-for-service model. But that, in turn, may result in an incentive to stint on quality. Insurance companies, meanwhile, lack bargaining power relative to hospitals and doctors.\nHealth reform advocates seek what experts label the \"triple aim\": improved quality of care, gains in the health of the population at large and reduced cost. But none of it will happen, say Burns and Pauly, if the past is prologue. Their paper enumerates infrastructure features and capabilities for a successful ACO and, one by one, finds them wanting, from physician-hospital alignment and care coordination to disease management, patient-centered medical homes and health information technology.\nFor example, they report lackluster returns on care coordination among multiple providers. In 2002, the CMS funded 15 demonstrations of care coordination for Medicare populations. Only three sites reduced patient cost and admissions, and even at those sites, Medicare recorded no net savings after factoring in added fees for care coordination. Only one program is still active today.\n\"Evaluators concluded that care coordination alone 'holds little promise of reducing total Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries with chronic illness,'\" the authors report. And, notably, patients with chronic illnesses consume a whopping share of health care dollars.\nWhat about \"disease management,\" a hot topic in medical cost containment? \"Net program benefits — in terms of health or money — have remained elusive,\" Pauly and Burns write. \"The Congressional Budget Office found insufficient evidence that disease management programs for Medicare can even pay for themselves.\"\nConsider a concept called patient centered medical homes, where teams, led by primary care physicians, supervise comprehensive patient services. Results are mixed, at best. There is evidence that medical homes can \"bend the cost trend for a while and address the 'triple aim' [in] dominant, well established care networks with large staffs, strong institutional management and the capacity to manage change,\" the authors write. But these results are beyond the ability of smaller institutions — those that use the vast majority of medical resources consumed in the U.S. — to reach.\nLikewise, much touted health information technology, despite quantum advances in capacity and delivery of information since the 1990s, yield less potential than advocates believe. \"Overall,\" Burns and Pauly report, \"the evidence suggests that information technology is necessary but insufficient to improve outcomes.\" Clinical decision support systems are supposed to improve physician decision-making, reduce medical errors and standardize therapy. \"Evidence on the benefits of diagnostic assistance offered by electronic systems is mixed,\" write the authors, \"partly because physicians often ignore the systems' advice.\"\nElectronic health records have been hailed as a big advance sure to rescue health care. Again, the authors are pessimistic. They see a different bottom line, one with scant evidence that digital record-keeping can cut costs. In fact, employee training and implementation can pile on costs for up to seven years. The same is true for many other elements of accountable",
        "baseline": " care organizations, the authors conclude.\nObamacare advertised two big features, Burns says: one, the extension of health insurance to 30 million new people, and two, a plan to pay for them with efficiencies on the delivery side that ACOs are supposed to supply. \"What our paper shows is that ACOs are not going to save money. They are going to cost a lot of money,\" Burns states, expressing frustration by what he sees as a failure to consider past experience. \"Obamacare will cost a lot more than everybody thinks.\" Examining \"the soft underbelly of Obamacare\" exposes looming cost overruns with scarce prospects for improvement in the quality of health care for sick individuals or the population as a whole, he adds.\nBurns points to the 5% to 10% of Medicare beneficiaries who run up most of the tab or Medicare. \"That is where efforts ought to be targeted,\" he says. \"Everybody changing everything invites more upheaval than the system can take.\"",

        "prompt": "Well, it does seem that fall is making its arrival. Leaves are slowly beginning to shed their summer green for more autumn hues and nights are just a bit on the nippy side.\nI am happy, though, that our local farmer's market still has lots of fresh vegetables and fruit to offer. During a recent visit on a Saturday morning, my wife Susanne and I came home with more than we really needed. But it all looked so good! As usual, I paged through the recipe book in my mind for some inspiration. This time it took me back to an unforgettable summer adventure in France.\nYears ago, Susanne and I were lucky enough to spend two weeks with friends from Toronto in a 'mas' (a Catalonian word for a country manor) in the southwestern corner of France. It was during the month of July so the weather was warm and the sun bright as could be. The country manor was located in a beautiful setting just off a mountain road. From the terrace on top of the 'mas' we could see the nearby Spanish border. That, we all decided, would be the ideal place for sunny, summer breakfasts.\nAfter doing a little cleaning, we decided it was time to take a short ride down the mountain road to the closest village. The scenery alone was worth the trip. There were all sorts of orchards, old country manors and even a sheep or two on the side of the road. After parking in the village, we decided to purchase some local food for the next few days. Susanne and I headed straight to the local bakery. To our surprise, there were crusty loaves of 'pain d'épeautre' (spelt bread) right in the bakery window. The baker explained how he produced the loaves and noted that the grain, an ancient relative of wheat, was common in the region. We purchased several loaves and then continued on our culinary venture through the narrow village streets.\nOur visit to the butcher was quite an educational experience as well. Monsieur Rodriquez explained that all the sausages and pâtés were homemade and that he also prepared all the meats. The salamis, hams and sausages all had names that would be familiar to many Spanish-speakers, especially the chorizo. Here the chorizo had much in common with the counterpart found in Spain. It was a sausage cured with paprika that could be sliced and eaten cold. The butcher kindly offered us a taste and we quickly decided to purchase some for an appetizer before our meal that evening. He asked if I was from the region because of my last name and the fact that I speak French. He added that many of his friends had names like Martinez, Fernandez and Lopez. In did tell him that, although I wasn't from the area, I certainly could get used to living there.\nAt the outdoor market there were all sorts of green and red bell peppers, onions, leeks, zucchini, carrots, cabbage and olives. There were fresh herbs and dried ones that one could use all year long. We also found a wide variety of melons, cherries, peaches, grapes and pears. Often merchants would offer a taste of the local fruits. After one bite it was simply too hard to resist making a purchase.\nA meal in that corner of the world wouldn't be complete without a glass of local wine and some cheese, so we couldn't forget those essentials either. We drove to a local wine producer recommended by the butcher. The man kindly allowed us to taste his wines. Maybe it was the sun, perhaps the surrounding countryside or even the wines themselves, but each glass tasted better than the last. Since we had purchased all sorts of food we chose several whites, rosés and reds. One the way back up the mountain we saw with a sign with a flying goat advertising local cheeses. We stopped at the rather crude looking establishment only to discover that the interior, where the cheeses were produced, was impeccably clean. The cheese maker, a man with only one tooth, was proud of his products and invited us to taste the cheeses. They were delicious and we purchased several kinds.\nThose two weeks we cooked almost every evening and enjoyed the riches of the land during breakfast, lunch and dinner either on the terrace of in the romantically lit dinning room.\nThere were some mishaps during our stay. One evening, some of us were chased through the surrounding forest by a wild boar. On yet another occasion, Susanne found a live scorpion in the door. Then there was the time when our friends' son had a bad brush with nettle bushes.\nBut, all in all, it was a wonderful stay. To this day, we all still talk about those times and really cherish them. And, with all the produce we've found at the farmer's market lately, I've had a good excuse to recreate some of the meals that we enjoyed during our stay in that sunny corner of southwestern France near the Spanish border.

Klines was always a family-run business, with the couple's two daughters often lending a hand.\nKlines hosted a hiking club, organized kayak trips and was for decades the site of a restaurant, a beauty salon and a physical therapy practice.\nSherry Piatt, 50, was among the longtime customers who wept when she heard the gym would soon close.\n\"This is better than any gym in Santa Barbara, where we lived for 25 years,\" said Piatt, who credits services offered at Klines - including a physical therapist - for enabling her to recover from back injuries.\n\"I couldn't believe when we moved to this tiny town that there was a club of this quality,\" she said.\nKlines' quality, however, did not protect it from changing circumstances and an ill-timed loan.\nPat Kline, 65, said that he and his wife had planned soon to sell the business and retire.\nSo three years ago, he took out a $250,000 loan to renovate the pool and buildings, steps he believed would make the property more salable.\nThen the recession hit.

Crouse excused.\nOLYMPIA – With strong bipartisan majorities in both houses, the Legislature passed a $33.6 billion operating budget Friday, staving off a threatened shutdown of some state government services.\nAfter a 105-day regular session, a first special session of 30 days and a second special session in its 16th day, a budget that some described as not having anything that everyone might want but enough things that most can support sailed through both chambers.\nGov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it Sunday, the last day of the fiscal year. Without the budget, the state wouldn’t have the legal authority to continue some programs and pay some salaries in the new fiscal year, which begins Monday.\nThe budget was the subject of months of negotiations, debates over the amount of money to be added to public schools or social service programs and taxes that would be raised or reduced.\nThe final product of those negotiations adds about $1 billion in new money for public schools, with an emphasis on all-day kindergarten for the state’s poorer schools, smaller class sizes in the earliest grades and an extra 80 hours of instruction for junior high and high school students. The state will also give school districts more financial help with transportation, maintenance, supplies and operating costs.\nThe budget freezes tuition at the state’s colleges and universities for this year, and makes it difficult to raise tuition next year. Sen. Mike Baumgartner, R-Spokane, who at one point proposed reducing tuition by 3 percent, called the freeze a victory considering that some legislators and Inslee proposed raising tuition at the beginning of the session.\n“It was a goal, but it was also a tactic,” Baumgartner said of the proposal to cut tuition.\nThe budget was notable for several reasons, said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville. For the first time since 1986, tuition at the state’s colleges and universities won’t go up, he said. A long list of tax increases proposed early in the session weren’t approved. Temporary taxes on service businesses and on some brands of beer, passed at the depths of the recession, will expire on Sunday as scheduled.\n“I’m afraid the whole system’s going to come crashing down upon us,” added Sen. Mike Padden, of Spokane Valley.\nIn fact, previous budgets drafted and passed by the predominantly Republican majority coalition included the expansion. Friday’s amendment failed on a 16-32 vote.\nRep. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, said the Medicaid expansion will affect an estimated 30,000 people in Spokane, about 24,000 who will become eligible for health coverage and about 6,000 people who are currently eligible but haven’t signed up.\nThe budget also contains $6 million for the new medical school",

Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane.\nBut it has no money for Innovate Washington, a program in the Department of Commerce that includes the former SIRTI facility; that’s a cut of $5.6 million from the 2011-13 budget.\nWhile some senators and representatives praised the bipartisan, bicameral process that finally led to the budget agreement that was announced Thursday, others said the Legislature deserves the public’s criticism for taking so long. Sen. Kevin Ranker, D-Orcas Island, said they owed an apology to tens of thousands of state workers for the stress created by not knowing until Friday evening whether they would be working on Monday because a partial government shutdown would have been required, if the budget had not passed.",

And our neighbour is the largest consumer of drugs in the world. And everybody wants to sell him drugs through our doors and our windows,” he said.\nHe did not go into more detail, but the remarks appeared to be a softening of Calderon’s attitude towards state regulation of the market for drugs, which could curb the power of the cartels by taking away their profits.\nSixteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia have allowed the use of medical marijuana but the federal government does not recognise their authority to do so and considers the dispensaries illegal.\nMarijuana is becoming the drug of choice among young adults in the United States and the use of methamphetamines and cocaine is waning, according to a recent national survey.\nIn Mexico, Calderon sent in the army against drug gangs shortly after taking office in late 2006.

Few of us would board a commercial airplane, for instance, without feeling confident that the pilot was well trained and accredited. Occupational licenses are a way to set a clear competence bar in such activities.\nBut licensing also acts to mute competition by creating barriers to market entry. There are plenty of activities where licensing is unnecessary, or unnecessarily strict, which limits market dynamism and possibly social mobility, too.\nState governments are regulating more everyday professions through licensing, according to a recent report by the White House. In the 1950s, roughly 5 percent of jobs required a license; now that number is roughly 25 percent. Most of that rise comes from an increase in the number of professions that demand licenses, rather than from increased employment in already licensed professions. As a recent paper from the Brookings Hamilton Project shows, occupations now requiring a state license include hair-dressing, auctioneering, makeup artistry, and scrap metal recycling.\nLicensing laws increase prices between 3 and 16 percent, depending on the particular profession. In many cases, there are better ways to ensure quality and professionalism, especially in the era of Yelp and TripAdvisor. In many cases, the regulations simply protect incumbent businesses, and benefit the schools that train those aspiring to become licensed. In some cases, the licensing schools have a direct hand in creating the state requirements. So there are some vested interests here.\n2. In many cases, people who�",

Licensing can act as a form of “opportunity hoarding,” allowing those with resources and connections to benefit from the higher incomes flowing from these occupations, in part by preventing others from competing with them. As Reihan Salam points out, questionable licensing extends well up the income distribution. Dentists in North Carolina prevent other professionals from providing teeth-whitening—even though the procedure is relatively straightforward. Insurance brokers in Utah play a similar game by attempting to make free equivalents of their service illegal. If nurses were allowed to perform more routine medical procedures, doctors would make slightly less, but nurses could earn more and overall health care costs would likely fall.\nLicensing is a necessary tool for protecting consumers. But it can also become a tool for protecting producers, hoarding status, and blocking an important path to upward mobility.",

Major political shifts, unprecedented economic growth, and political leaders challenging US influence and championing regional autonomy, have combined to reshape an emerging new continent.\nWith ideologies and policies as varying as Venezuela’s Bolivarian socialism, Colombia’s economic liberalism and the centrism of Brazil and Argentina being exercised throughout the region, Empire examines the geopolitical shifts across Latin America and asks what challenges may yet lie ahead.\nThe time when Latin America just looked to the United States and Europe is over [...] The relationship with the United States will always be tense, because they will always want to keep the status quo, and we will always want to change the status quo.\nIncreasingly plural and self-confident, Latin America is creating and exploiting a growing international profile - politically and economically. The region’s trade with China, which recently surpassed that between China and the US, is currently worth over $200bn a year and has undergone a staggering 20-fold increase since 2000.\nBut as intra-regional and South-South ties have strengthened, the challenges have inevitably grown more complex in this new continental order. With competing visions for the future, can Latin American leaders reach consensus?\nOn the domestic front, Chile and Brazil have recently witnessed mass demonstrations against controversial public spending policies.\nThe long-running US-led 'war on drugs' while dismantling some of Colombia’s most powerful cartels, has failed to contain the spread of violence and organised crime across borders. Empire scratches beneath the surface of this ‘war’ against the drug trade to expose the machinations of an enduring continental scourge.\nWhile US influence in the region may have experienced a relative decline, Washington still wields considerable power, casting a critical, and at times suspicious, eye over the changes blowing through its former ‘backyard’.\nWith a burgeoning continent in flux, Empire asks: How has its relationship with the US changed? Who loses and who wins in this new regional order? And what form will a region, characterised by conflicting ideas, take in the future?\nJoining us to analyse and uncover some of these issues are: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former president of Brazil; Otto Perez Molina, the president of Guatemala; Cesar Gaviria, the former president of Colombia; and Jeremy McDermott, the co-founder of the South American organised crime research institute, InSight Crime.\nWe",

        "prompt": "WASHINGTON - The Obama administration is aggressively pursuing lawsuits over minority voting rights in Texas and North Carolina, but the Justice Department has not moved on evidence that the latest round of redistricting in Los Angeles County unfairly reduces the influence of Latino voters.\nNearly half the 10 million people in the nation's largest county are Latino. But political boundaries redrawn in 2011 make it possible for Latino voters to elect just one of the five supervisors.\nThe administration has resisted calls to sue the county, despite the county's history of discrimination against Latino voters in earlier redistricting efforts.\nThe inaction rankles some Latino activists who count themselves as strong backers of President Barack Obama.\n\"I support the Obama administration and the president, but frankly, Obama and the top people around him seem to be unaware on this issue. Obama is somewhat blind to the issues of Latinos,\" said Cruz Reynoso, a former California Supreme Court justice and member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Reynoso said the administration seems more attuned to voting rights complaints of African-Americans.\nHe said the administration also appears reluctant to pursue a complaint against a jurisdiction that is dominated by Democrats. \"Most of the folk in Los Angeles have been supporters of the president, so why make them unhappy despite the fact that, from my point of view, there is great injustice going on,\" he said.\nIn the wake of a stinging U.S. Supreme Court defeat in June that rendered useless an important enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act, the administration has focused its voting rights resources on Southern states that are controlled by Republicans.\nThe Justice Department has initiated or joined suits targeting voter identification laws and redistricting plans in North Carolina and in Texas, where Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott began moving to put the state's tough voter ID law into effect just hours after the high court's decision.\nThe suits were filed under other provisions of the voting rights law that were not part of the Supreme Court case.\nThe situation in Los Angeles County predates the high court decision and the passage of the laws now being challenged in North Carolina and Texas.\nThe Justice Department acknowledges it is looking at the situation in Los Angeles, but otherwise declined comment.\n\"We have received significant amounts of information from the county and others about the issue and the matter is still under review,\" said Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson.\nMatt Barreto, a political science professor and voting rights expert at the University of Washington, said the evidence against the county is overwhelming and includes a history of racially polarized voting that has hurt Latinos.\n\"My perspective is that this is one of the easiest cases to be made nationally,\" said Barreto, who has worked for the group of Latinos that includes Reynoso. Barreto also served as a consultant to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a voter-approved independent board that draws the state's congressional and legislative districts.\nCounties, though, retain the authority to devise their own districts. Nowhere is there more power and money at stake than in Los Angeles, where each of five supervisors represents nearly 2 million people and the county's annual budget tops $26 billion.\nFollowing the 2010 census, the board adopted districts in 2011 that made relatively few changes even though two supervisors cautioned that their colleagues were exposing themselves to a voting rights lawsuit.\nGloria Molina, the only Latina ever elected to the board, and Mark Ridley-Thomas, the board's lone African-American member, supported maps that would have created a second district with a majority of Latino residents. But the two members could not persuade their three white colleagues to join them.\n\"Today this board had an opportunity to make history, not repeat it, but all signs indicated that they would repeat history",

Her spokeswoman, Roxane Marquez, said Molina continues to back two majority Latino districts, but otherwise had no comment on possible Justice Department intervention.\nRidley-Thomas told Bill Boyarsky, a columnist for LA Observed, that he wants the Justice Department to get involved.\nThe map Ridley-Thomas proposed in 2011 would have increased the chances of making the Los Angeles board more diverse, said redistricting consultant Alan Clayton. Ridley-Thomas' map would have preserved his district, created a second district likely to elect a Latino and increased the odds that an Asian-American candidate could be elected, Clayton said.",

The county's Latino population is now 48 percent, compared with 28 percent in 1990.\nThe county's Latino population is roughly equal to the combined populations of North Carolina and Texas, the two states currently being sued by the Justice Department.\nIn a 2011 report, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said the county's redistricting plan \"is likely to violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\" and recommended",

With a current attachment rate of almost eight games for every PS3, that's over 3.5 million Blu-ray Disc games that have been sold to date in Australia.\"\nMr Ephraim said the new plant should be a clear sign to consumers that Blu-ray is now a \"permanent fixture on the format landscape in Australia\" but PS3 owners will also be hoping the plant helps reduce local Blu-ray prices and ensures more timely releases.\n\"but PS3 owners will also be hoping the plant helps reduce local Blu-ray prices and ensures more timely releases. \"\nI guess any investment that creates & promotes australian jobs cant be sneered at.\nMy assumption is Blu-ray sales are at a point to justify the investment?\nThat attachment rate doesn't include 2nd hand games. I'm looking forward to the second hand bluray movie market opening up.\nThey're still to expensive for me to buy casually.\nOf course BD prices will reduce eventually. It's the exact same thing that happened with DVDs and CDs when they were first introduced. It's not rocket science people. Prices will drop but it takes time for the new technology to integrate into society. Besides, most JB stores already have 2-for-1 deals and bargain bins for BD.\nIt's interesting to see that Sony are still pushing the \"PS3 isn't expensive becuase it has a blu-ray player\" line considering the price of stand alone blu-ray players has dropped considerably.\nSpot on. If anything localy made blu-rays and games would be slightly more expensive given the price of labour and manufacturing in Australia when compared to some Asian countries.\nlol thanks Cannon for filling in for the troll today.\nSame reason why I haven't ventured into blu-ray yet. That and the fact that most of the DVDs I have are not available in blu-ray and probably not for a while (or ever).\nBut having something local is a good step. It will only be a matter of time though, before we see any real difference.\nSounds like it could be good news, but we'll wait and see. I care about cost, not the triumphant raising of a Blu-ray flag over Huntingwood.\nI have very few Blu-ray movies because the picture quality isn't 300% better than DVD but the price usually is.\n@Infinitum, if you have a large screen HD TV, the picture quality is at least 300% better than DVD. I still buy DVDs for SD TV shows and cartoons, but if it's a special effects driven or visual film, Blu-Ray is a must, the difference is night and day. If you have a small TV, I'd stick to the cheaper DVDs.\nWhy is Stephen Conroy there?\nIs he trying to secretly censor Blu Ray as well as the internets?\nYou are spot on. A recent action/effects driven movie like Iron Man, Die Hard 4.0, or the latest Hulk movie all look unbelievable on a large HD LCD TV on Blu Ray. With prices still averaging $30+ for BD it's a waste to bother with comedies and dramas. But if you want your explosions, monsters, zombies, bullet wounds, etc. to look the best possible Blu Ray completely craps all over DVD.\nI'm still scratching my head over older movies like Clockwork Orange or Breaker Morant receiving the Blu Ray treatment though. There is only so much you can do to film that is that old and low quality already.\nPeter, I have a 42\" HD (but not full HD) LCD TV. The only movies I would buy on BR are those sorts of special-effects driven movies and even then only recent ones. I've got a couple of double-ups of older movies and it's far from night and day on my setup, though I concede it would be running a side-by-side comparison of a new release on full HD TVs. But generally speaking at current prices - no thanks.\nActually some of the best looking BluRays I have are of older movies. Close Encounters of the Third Kind is incredible to watch in HD. Also The Thing on HDDVD is fantastic (Kurt Russells beard has never looked manlier).\nYou must remember that film has an incredible resoultion, so if effort is put into restoring it the outcome can be quite stunning.\nWho are they kidding!

        "prompt": "The first thing that comes to mind when you hear something like that is probably “correlation does not imply causation,” a favorite axiom of anyone who’s studied (or heard of) economics. Few would argue that this case, in which the Tigers lost last season's Ivy League Player of the Year, is an exception to that axiom. Looking at how the team has done so far, however, I can’t help but wonder if losing Hummer didn’t have some positive effects. Princeton is 6-1 and was three points away from defeating Butler in its only loss this season, whereas this time last year the Tigers were 3-5. They were averaging 57.6 points per game; they’re now averaging 71.3. Something good must be happening.\nNobody’s matching Hummer’s 16.3 points per game this season. Nobody needs to. The top five are outperforming last year’s top five, combining to put up over 6 more points per game. Nobody’s over 15 points per game, but five Tigers are averaging in the double digits, something only Hummer and then-sophomore forward Denton Koon did last season.\nWith Hummer gone, this year’s stars are spreading the wealth. Hummer was never a ball-hog —he led the team in assists last season —but a certain amount of ball-hoggery comes with the territory when you’re really, really good. Now, the Tigers can’t dish it off to Hummer and hope for the best, and they’re having success taking things into their own hands. Sophomore forward Hans Brase is taking twice as many shots per game as he did last year and is scoring twice as many points, while the already-prolific shooter Koon is taking almost three more shots per game.\nNobody’s shooting as much as Hummer, but two players are out-performing his 51.7 shooting percentage of 2012-13. Senior guard T.J. Bray is shooting 57.7 percent from the floor despite missing games with a hand injury (which, I would imagine, could negatively affect some people’s ability to shoot) and this weekend’s Rookie of the Week Spencer Weisz is shooting 61.8 percent. Senior forward Will Barrett is shooting 43.8, but, given that he led the Ivy League in field-goal percentage last season, I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to speculate that that number is going to go up quite a bit as the season goes on.\nThe Tigers are",

This year, the Tigers are about as accurate from three-point land as they were last year. The fact that they’re taking more long-distance shots, something which former Sports Editor and stats guru Kevin Whitaker ’13 says is more practical than shooting two-point jumpers, may account for a lot of that increased points-per-game number.\nWe don’t need to celebrate the fact that the second-highest scorer in Princeton history has moved on, but give this year’s Tigers some credit.

        "prompt": "A small study published Tuesday in the Archives of Neurology found preliminary evidence that spraying critical insulin deep into the nose could help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Ray Suarez speaks with University of Washington School of Medicine professor Suzanne Craft, who led the study.\nAn estimated five million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and there's no known cure. But a new trial offers some early promise for tackling the disease at its early stages, using a daily spritz of insulin.\nThe idea behind the trial was relatively simple: Patients with Alzheimer's disease lose critical insulin in the brain as their condition worsens. What if insulin could be supplemented?\nResearchers at the VA Medical Center in Washington state did just that. They gave patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease a nasal spray containing insulin twice a day for four months. Early results published in The Journal of Neurology today were encouraging. Insulin delayed memory loss and other problems.\nSuzanne Craft led the study at the VA and the University of Washington School of Medicine, where she's a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.\nAnd, Professor, a lot of people are familiar with insulin as the hormone that helps metabolize fat and carbohydrate. What does it do in the brain, and what led people to wonder if supplementing it might help with Alzheimer's?\nWell, you're right. The most well-known role of insulin is in treating diabetes. But, in the last few years, we have come to understand that insulin has a number of very important roles to play in the brain. In particular, it's very critical for memory, for memories — for memories to form.\nAnd it also protects against the toxic effects of proteins, like the amyloid protein, which is the protein that collects in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. And, interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease appear to have a deficiency of insulin in their brain or the insulin that is there doesn't work effectively.\nSo, that led us to wonder whether or not supplementing insulin would be of benefit to patients with Alzheimer's disease, possibly to improve their symptoms or to ameliorate their pathology.\nWell, we're still early in the course of this study. And it was a small one, right? How did you pick the people who were used in this research?\nYes, you're right. It is early in the life of this area of research.\nOur participants were patients with very early Alzheimer's disease. They either had the prodromal condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment or they had very mild, very early Alzheimer's disease. So they were volunteers who came to our clinics to be in our study.\nAnd once they used this insulin, what could you observe happening inside their brains?\nWell, we had three groups.\nWe had a group who received a placebo, an inactive substance. And we had two groups who received different doses of insulin. And as you said, they received insulin for four months. And what we saw were significant improvements in memory for the participants who received the lower dose of insulin.\nAnd we also looked for some of our participants at the way the brain was able to use glucose. We know that that is a problem for patients with Alzheimer's disease. And we observed, for the placebo group, their brain used less glucose over time, which is a common pattern in Alzheimer's, whereas, for our insulin-treated folks, they had either no change in their glucose use in their brain or in some areas even an improvement.\nHow do you test someone with mild cognitive impairment? How do you check whether they have improved or at least slowed down in their advance? What tools do you use?\nWell, there are a number of different memory tests that have been developed.\nAnd the test that we used is one of the most sensitive to the very earliest stages of memory loss. It's called a story recall test. And so the participants hear a story that's read to them and then we ask them to tell us back right away all of the details of the story that they have just heard. And then we wait 30 minutes and ask them again to recall all of the details.\nAnd so the amount of information that they're able to hold on to over that 30-minute period is a very good indicator of the state of their memory. And what we observed was that the participants that were treated with the lower dose of insulin were able to remember more details over the 30-minute period after four months of treatment than was the placebo group.\nSo you had this promising initial result in this small group in phase two. Where do you go from here? And how do you ramp up? What are you looking for?\nWell, the next phase is going to be very important.\nWhat we need to do is to administer insulin for a longer period of time than four months. We need to know that this is going to be safe when it's given over a longer period. And we also have some reason to believe that it will be even more effective if it's given for a longer period of time.\nSo that's a very important next step. And our plans are to give it for a year-and-a-half. And then the other aspect of this is that we need to bring this into a larger arena. And we will be proposing a study that will be carried out in many centers across the country, in centers where there are Alzheimer's research centers that are funded by the National Institute of Health.\nAnd so we will be — we will be improving the study in terms of having it be translated into a larger scale and for a longer period of time.\nThere are already millions of people who are taking insulin routinely. Is there anything we can learn from taking a look at them?\nOf course, the people who are taking insulin routinely are folks with diabetes. And we know that diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, that if one has diabetes, one is more likely over one's lifetime to develop Alzheimer's disease. So it's very important for folks with diabetes to control their diabetes well.\nAnd what we have learned is that, if you are able to control your diabetes well, then you are able to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\nStressing again that it is still early",
        "baseline": " days, if all goes well and the results continue to be promising, how far out are we talking about, one, three, five years, before we get this as an on-label use for insulin?\nWell, our hope is, if we're able to start this next phase of study by next summer — that's our plan, if we are able to receive and funding — then, within three to four years, we should have a very good idea of whether this will work as a therapy in the current form that we're testing.\nBut I also want to point out, what — in terms of a proof of concept, what our study indicates is that therapies that are directed at correcting the insulin abnormality in Alzheimer's disease may be very fruitful lines of research. So I'm sure that the study will also generate a large number of studies looking at other ways of improving insulin function in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.\nProfessor Suzanne Craft, thanks for joining us.",

They also took on the company’s head office in Cologne.\nHaving started the business more than 30 years ago, the Smyth family noted at the time of the acquisition that they were “convinced about the future of multi-channel specialist toy retail” and confident that their brand could be grown into continental Europe.\nThe move puts the company amongst the largest specialist toy retail chains in Europe and now more than 40 per cent of its network will be located on the continent.\nTony, Pádraig, Liam and Tom have been here before when they rapidly expanded into the UK and it would appear as though they’ll have no trouble ensuring this particular deal pays off.\nAs sales go, Séamus Mulligan’s disposal of Adapt Pharma was a spectacular one.\nThe deal to sell to US company Emergent saw Mulligan and his fellow investors sharing in a windfall of $635 million (€562 million), the majority of which was in cash.\nEstablished in 2014 with an investment of $115 million, Adapt developed Narcan, a naloxone nasal spray that revives people who have overdosed on opioids. More importantly, however, was that the drug was developed in the midst of an opioid crisis in the US and Narcan was seen as being attractive because of the simplicity with which it could be used.\nPreviously only available as an injection, the nasal spray aspect made it easier for non-medical personnel, like policemen, teachers, family and friends, to help reduce the 72,000 toll of lives lost to overdose in the US alone last year.\nAnd while the deal was extraordinarily lucrative for Mulligan and his colleagues, the reason behind the sale was driven by the desire to expand the drug’s user base. The need for additional capital and resources to maximise the public health benefit was seen as one of the key reasons to sell.\nThe deal in November that caught our eyes was the sale of One4all, the gift voucher business, in a move which valued the company at €100 million.\nFinancial technology specialist Blackhawk Network bought the company in an agreement placing an enterprise value on Gift Voucher Shop – the company behind One4all – in the region of about €100 million. The term “enterprise value” embraces the figure paid for a company along with its liabilities.\nReports last year had suggested the company could sell for more than €60 million.\nThe deal gave both the company’s founder, Michael Dawson, and An Post a significant payout.

        "prompt": "Cranbury, N.J. – Jan 3, 2017 – The recently completed presidential election in Somaliland was the world’s first to use iris recognition to create a voter registration list and remove duplicate names from the rolls. The iris-based biometric technology, from Iris ID, helped ensure a free and fair election, so important for the autonomous state to gain the international recognition it seeks.\nA 60-member team of international observers, representing 27 countries, certified the November election as free and fair – a change from previous elections in which duplicate registrations led to questions about the legitimacy of the results. Somaliland, located on the Horn of Africa, declared its independence from Somalia in 1991.\n“In a world-first, these elections employed pioneering iris-recognition technology to register and identify voters, which is a testament to Somaliland’s commitment to its resources in democratic institutions and the rule of law,” said the new president, Muse Bihi Abdi, in a column for the Financial Times.\nSomaliland’s National Electoral Commission reported an 80 percent turnout for the election.\nThe NEC spent several years preparing for the vote, including the process of choosing a biometric technology to register citizens. Commission members wanted a system capable of noting those registering more than once. Both fingerprint facial recognition systems failed to recognize many duplicate registrations in the program’s early stages.\nAt the recommendation of international election consultants, the commission tried an iris-based system. In a trial project, the Iris ID technology was able to accurately recognize all 457 instances of duplicates seeded into a base of 1,062 registrations. Experts estimate as many as 30,000 duplicates were identified during the countrywide registration. De-duplication was possible using Iris ID software which compared the high-quality biometric data from the iris scans.\nEnrollment speed also worked in Iris ID’s favor. Roy Dalle Vedove, a prominent international elections specialist and NEC consultant, said the iris-based system was not only more accurate than fingerprint technology, but also cut the time needed to register a voter in half.\nAfter selecting the Iris ID technology, the NEC and purchased 350 portable registration kits consisting of a laptop computer, handheld iris scanner, webcam for facial photos, a flash and tripod. Registration stations were set up across the country – many in remote rural areas. Once approved, citizens received a temporary certificate until their national voter card was processed.\nSomaliland is now set to become a regional powerhouse in the production and deployment of the technological know-how that underpins electronic voting, wrote Calestous Juma in South Africa’s Mail & Guardian",

        "prompt": "“If it isn’t over by September,” Rudy Giuliani tells Sean Hannity about the Robert Mueller investigation, “then we have a very serious problem.” Best guess: They’ll have a very serious problem. Donald Trump’s legal team sent a counterproposal back to Mueller regarding an interview with their client earlier in the day, attempting to take topics completely off the table — and then going on TV with Sean Hannity to call the whole investigation corrupt.\nOther than that, Mr. Mueller, how did you like the obstruction? Trump’s legal team wants to screen off any possibility that their client will incriminate himself in an interview on those subjects. They’re apparently entirely sanguine about the Russia-collusion hypothesis being a dead end, but obstruction is an easier target for wily prosecutors. It doesn’t take much to set up a perjury trap, especially when dealing with a target with a mouth as famously undisciplined as Trump. Taking Comey and Flynn off the table closes off any path to obstruction … which is why Mueller’s not about to buy off on those terms.\nWhich brings us back to Hannity’s question: If it’s so corrupt as to be a “Watergate on the part of the investigators,” why cooperate at all? For that matter, why not order Rod Rosenstein to shut it down? The political",
        "baseline": " damage would be too great, of course, but the offers of cooperation are undercutting the attacks on Mueller and the investigation. At some point, most Americans will conclude that it’s just spin, even if the underlying allegations don’t amount to much so far.\nThe other possibility is that Giuliani & Co want to run out the clock on Mueller. Giuliani tried arguing in this segment that the upcoming midterm elections present a hard deadline for Mueller, which he’s been arguing for the last several months without much merit. Supposedly, the DoJ’s guidelines discourage investigative activity within 60 days of an election for someone running, but Trump’s not running and no one paid attention to those guidelines in either direction in 2016. Like any other special counsel investigation, Mueller’s is completely open-ended without any deadlines except those which he sets for himself.\nThat’s a good reason to refrain from appointing special counsels in the first place.",
        "llm_baseline": " pressure on the deputy attorney general is enormous, and he’s already been forced to recuse himself from the investigation. If Trump wants to fire him, he can do it. If he wants to fire Mueller, he can do that too. The only thing stopping him is the fear that he’ll be impeached for it. But if the investigation is corrupt, why not just fire Rosenstein and Mueller and be done with it?\nThe answer is that Trump’s legal team knows that the investigation isn’t corrupt. They know that Mueller is a straight shooter and that the FBI is a professional organization. They know that the investigation is going to continue, and that it’s going to continue to produce evidence of wrongdoing. They know that Trump is going to be impeached, and that he’s going to be convicted. They know that he’s going to be removed from office, and that he’s going to be indicted.

Instead, he’s doing his best to keep the investigation going.\nThe only explanation for that is that Trump and his team know they’re in trouble. They know that Mueller and his team are not out to get them, that their investigation is not a witch hunt, and that their case is not going to be dismissed out of hand.

Could Trump fire him and replace him with someone who would shut it down? But that would be a political disaster, and it would be a disaster for Trump’s legal team as well. Prosecutors would be able to argue that Trump was trying to obstruct justice by shutting down the investigation, and that would be a very serious problem indeed.\nThe only way to avoid that problem is to cooperate with Mueller, and hope that the investigation doesn’t turn up anything that Mueller can use to indict Trump. Very risky, but it’s the only way to avoid the very serious problem that Rudy Giuliani is talking about. So far, Trump’s legal team has been able to keep the investigation from turning up anything that Mueller can use to indict Trump.

For now, anyway.\nStill, the question is worth asking, and it comes from the same place as the question about whether or not Mueller will be able to find anything of substance: Trump’s team is not only dismissive of the Russia-collusion hypothesis, they’re dismissive of the idea that Trump and his team will be found to have done something wrong in connection to that.

        "prompt": "Even if you have home cinema ambitions and deep pockets, there's no denying that projectors are just too cumbersome for many. Optoma's latest pocket-sized LED projector might promise great things for home entertainment in the long run, but for now this second-gen device is just not up to the demands of home cinema.\nIf you're out and about giving business presentations, however, the idea of a genuinely portable projector will appeal, and the mobile phone-sized Pico is initially hugely impressive.\nIts chief attraction isn't its tiny size, but the ability to store 4GB of files on the gadget itself. What other projector - of any size - can do that? What's more, the Optoma claims a huge file compatibility list that doesn't just cover the basics. For images, the Pico plays JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP, TGA, FPX, PCX, PCD and PSD, though it doesn't play any music files despite having a 0.5W speaker.\nOn the video side, the Pico claims to play AVI, WMV, ASF, 3GP, 3G2, DAT, MPG, MPEG, MOV, MP4, M4V, RM, RMVB, OGM and FLV files. However, there's a huge caveat; absolutely everything - including PowerPoint presentations - have to be converted using ArcSoft Media Converter software that's supplied in the projector's memory itself. There's worse news, however - it only works with a PC, not on a Mac. That's unusual these days, and surprising since this product is being sold on Apple's website as a bona fide accessory for Apple products.\nThe Pico does, however, come with a few cables that mean external devices can be manually attached - a messy situation, and the only option for those with Apple devices (even then, a separate MiniDisplay port to VGA adapter and a VGA cable must be bought for Macs, or a separate iPod connection kit). In the box cables are supplied for Composite video, Component video and VGA, so it's possible to attach almost anything; we'd wager the Composite video will be most useful for its compatibility (with the adaptor) for iPhones and iPods, camcorders, laptops, games consoles, DVD players and cameras.\nThere's no doubting the Pico's svelte design; somehow Optoma has packed-in a wheel for operating the menus, a tiny focus wheel and speaker near the lamp, a slot for a tripod - a seemingly essential accessory, though not supplied in the box - and its proprietary VGA/USB slot and minijack AV slot.\nSwitch on the Pico and you're presented with a very simple menu with icons for Video, Pictures and Presentations. Click into each one and a list is presented of all the files, though it's very basic.\nDuring our tests the menus frequently froze. A separate folder dragged into the Photos folder on the Pico refused to display - all files must seemingly be placed \"loose\" on the projector, though its ability to play slideshows might appeal.\nIf you're using an external video source, you can bypass all of this, though it's best to dive into the Settings menu first to make sure the Pico is on full brightness - its Eco setting isn't recommended.\nThe Pico's performance with video is just about",

Colour consequently drains out of the picture, while at other times some colours are over saturated.\nLast year's Pico PK101 had a paltry light output of 20 ANSI Lumens, and we'd wager that hasn't increased by much in this refreshed model. Built-in storage and a VGA input has been added, but there are problems with the user interface that do make this portable projector feel cumbersome.

        "prompt": "AT $42, a nicely charred 16-ounce slab of prime boneless strip loin might not seem like much of a bargain now, but it could soon.\nOver the past two months or so the cost of producing beef and the demand for it have risen so much that prices are soaring and the supply of top quality beef has dropped. Customers at steakhouses and markets will see the effects in coming weeks if they haven’t already.\nThe price of steers ready for slaughter jumped to 98 cents a pound last month from 83 cents a pound in April 2006, according to Urner Barry, a publisher of marketing reports. After slaughtering, transporting and butchering, a restaurant’s cost for a well-trimmed steak may be 30 percent higher, said Bob Mark, director of sales for Buckhead Beef Northeast, in South Plainfield, N.J., a division of Buckhead Beef, a wholesaler based in Atlanta.\nThe last time prices reached those levels was at the end of 2003, but they dropped sharply in early 2004. This time people in the meat business think the increase will be more persistent.\n“The bottom line is that we have to assume that beef prices will not come down any time soon,” said Ephraim Leibtag, an economist who specializes in retail stores and restaurants for the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture.\nMany of the factors pushing up prices are also affecting quality.\nThe demand for ethanol and a harsh winter have caused the price of corn to rise about 60 percent over the past few months. Farmers are planting more corn now, but Mr. Leibtag would not predict a price drop soon.\nThe quality of beef has also been hurt by the stress of a hard winter.\nAdam Perry Lang, the chef at Robert’s Steakhouse in Manhattan, said that some farmers are supplementing corn feed with cheaper wheat and soy, giving the beef less flavor and less marbling.\nIn the past about 2 percent of all beef graded out as prime — the top variety, the most well marbled, with flavorful, tenderizing fat. Some wholesalers think that may have dropped to as low as 0.5 percent. The supply of top levels of choice beef, the next grade, has also shrunk.\nEven if a restaurant says it is serving prime meat, it may not be. If your steak lacks a deep beefiness and is too chewy to be pleasurable, it is probably choice grade. And if no grade is given on the menu, you can be sure it is choice.\nThe shortage of prime beef has led Marilyn Spiera, an owner of Peter Luger Steak House in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to cut back on reservations, close the restaurant earlier each day and book fewer large parties, which she also did the last time beef prices were this high, in 2003. “It’s hitting us worse now,” she said, noting that prime beef that meets her standards is scarcer now. The restaurant recently increased the price of the porterhouse for two, to $81 from $79.90.\nYet demand continues to escalate. The number of steakhouses grows every year. The Zagat Survey of New York restaurants for 2007, for example, lists 80 steakhouses, an increase of about 10 percent from the year before. And after banning American beef for several years because of concerns about mad cow disease, Japan and South Korea are now permitting imports.\nThe Palm steakhouse chain has raised the price of its steaks by $2, and side dishes have gone up 50 cents to help compensate for the price of the beef. “I don’t think our customers have noticed,” said Walter H. McClure, the chief operating officer of the Palm Restaurant Group.\nTom Colicchio, whose lineup at Craftsteak includes grass-fed beef, which is less affected by the cost of corn, said he was thinking about raising prices. Laurent Tourondel, whose BLT restaurants serve hanger and flat iron steaks in addition to the luxury cuts, said he bought all his supplies in January, guaranteeing his price until the end of the year.\nMarc Murphy, an owner of Landmarc, in TriBeCa and in the Time Warner Center, said higher prices and lower quality have not been a problem. But his hanger, skirt, strip loin, fillet and rib-eye are all choice grade.\nMost supermarket shoppers buy choice grade. Mr. Leibtag of the Department of Agriculture said shoppers would soon be affected by rising costs and limited supply. The most recent average retail supermarket prices for choice grade that the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade group based in Chicago, could provide were from March. They reflected an overall 2 percent increase compared with the year before.\nSkirt steak, first popularized for fajitas, now has a wider audience and represents a rich-tasting alternative for home grilling.\nThe h",

FroSoCo consists of approximately 100 first-year students and 70 sophomores living in two adjoining houses. Admission is by application, and once admitted, students can opt to stay for their sophomore year, making it one of the only places on campus where you can easily return to be with your friends.\nWhat makes FroSoCo unique is its reputation for being especially nerdy (even among the Nerd NationTM) and for strongly encouraging students to “geek out together.” This means three specific things. First, students have and develop a deep enthusiasm in one or many topics, subjects, or domains (be a “geek”). “Deep enthusiasm” doesn't mean being an expert, it just means really getting excited about something! Second, students are proud and free to express this intense interest (i.e. be “out” about their interest). FroSoCo students openly share the ups and the downs of their journey. Third, students “geek out” with other students. Importantly, FroSoCo students “geek out together” about many nerdy things ranging from poetry to politics to programming. There is a playful, hard-working, energy that permeates the house. And while this happens across campus, it is the intensity and sometimes scale with which FroSoCo does this, given the longstanding culture established by the College, that makes it unique.\nJennifer and Scott Calvert (with their sons Van and Rockwell) are the Resident Fellows (RFs) for FroSoCo.\nJenn and Scott met during their time in college when they were on staff together (feel free to “awww”). Scott majored in Neuroscience before getting his Master’s in Film Production and Media Arts. Jennifer got her undergraduate degree in English and started work as a high school teacher for English language learners. She then received her Master’s in Counseling and her PhD in Educational Leadership and Learning Technology. Scott and Jenn have lived and worked in Texas, New Hampshire, and Philadelphia (technically, that last one is not a state, but it’s Philly…it can’t be lumped in with Lancaster). Scott currently works as a video maker, editor and storytelling consultant. Jenn works in Student Affairs at Stanford.\nScott enjoys movies (or “films”—if you’re feeling artsy), comic books (graphic novels), geek collectibles, art, and anything pop culture. Jenn enjoys building things (especially with LEGO), cooking and reading about organizational behavior, education, race, gender and generally anything non-fiction. She’s secretly writing a book. Together they love spending time with friends, finding great places to eat and exploring the world.\nJenn and Scott have discovered that meaningful relationships are both the bedrock and catalysts for their own personal growth and learning. They were indelibly shaped by the relationships they formed in college. In their roles as RFs, it is their hope that they can help create a space where students can form their own meaningful relationships, explore, learn and grow. They look forward to making FroSoCo their home.\nCool is overrated. We're not sure that's the goal. We get to know each other.

        "prompt": "After having received board approval for a significant strategic change, the management must be considerate of its other stakeholders before pushing for the roll-out. Each stakeholder is bound to be impacted by the changes, though in different ways. The employees and clients, in particular, need to fully understand the rationale of these moves.\nMost strategies are top-driven with shareholders and the board setting the direction, and management pushing that agenda throughout the organisation. To be successful, managements must involve the entire organisation in the implementation and with due consideration to the company’s ecosystem, work culture and operating structures. And design appropriate internal and external communication.\nIt is true the life cycle of any strategy roll-out has many parts, between the envisioning, planning, and execution to achieve sustainability. The transformation goals need a definitive preparedness at the enterprise level. Often, critical strategies are pushed with little consideration to the company’s readiness to absorb change.\nDepending on the nature of the move, the company needs to be diligent in its communication for both internal and external. The internal communication focused on employees should gain their endorsement to reduce risks of any downturn in morale or to rule out any miscommunication.\nThe external communication must articulate the rationale and its reach to media and other patrons.\nFor instance, cost-cutting is a standard strategy that impacts employees the most. This plays havoc on the entire corporate ecosystem and if not managed diligently often undermines performance as an adverse reaction. The usual cuts in salaries, perks, and facilities though are standard to company transformations, but these require diligent handling.\nThese moves must be followed through by tactical engagement with each group impacted by the measures. The top leadership must lead the engagement, not just the HR division, to explain the rationale of any cost-cutting strategy as these must be aligned with the overall good of a company. In this message, the right of all must be highlighted and percolate down to the entire organisation.\nThe shared goal of no pain, no gain must be well articulated. In case of a company’s downsizing, employee morale nosedives and which can fuel job insecurity through the entire organisation as well as pose a trust deficit with clients too if the transition process is not managed.\nChanges such as management restructuring must not be envisaged without engaging clients and employees. The employees should be the primary audience here and be given the opportunity to follow this change before rolling it out to other stakeholders.\nBut how often is it that employees get to know about change either through the press or by noticing a new face in the office corridor.\nBesides general cost reduction and management restructure, there are other critical moves such as HR policy review, ERP implementation, office moves and even catering decisions that need innovative change management.\nFor instance, ERP and new technology roll-",

        "prompt": "In 2005, the San Jose (Calif.) Police Department transitioned from a complex Aikido-based Arrest and Control program to a simple Defense and Arrest Tactics system grounded in functional tactics, concepts, and principles. The old method failed to teach self-defense or combative skills other than with the baton, while the new system borrowed extensively from other contemporary police DT systems, and incorporated the science of motor-skill learning to the instructional process. Local academies in the South Bay area soon followed suit and adopted the new program.\nAs the developer and lead instructor of the new system, I was often asked by Field Training Officers (FTO) how they could evaluate a recruit schooled in a program different from that in which they were trained. Some used their “lack of knowledge” of the new system as an excuse to avoid rating the recruit in this competency. Some had an allegiance to the old system and therefore declined to attend any training offered by me and my co-instructors on the new program. Most, however welcomed the change and solicited suggestions as to how they could evaluate a recruit in the field when he or she employed, for instance a handcuffing process different from what they were taught.\nThe first and most obvious answer to the problem of technique unfamiliarity is for the FTO to get together with the department’s DT instructor and learn the new system. While this may sound burdensome, FTOs are (or should be) experienced officers with skills of their own, and if the new system is based upon simple skills the FTO should have little difficulty picking up on the different techniques. Remember, a wrist-lock is a wrist-lock, an interview stance is an interview stance, and as far as a baton strike goes... well, there are only so many ways to swing a stick.\nFor those FTOs who, like many departments these days are seeing more lateral officers who have been trained in a system taught by another agency, the problem may be more pronounced. However, before you throw up your hands, talk to your agency’s DT instructor. It is very likely that he or she has stayed on top of the trends in subject control and may be familiar with the skills taught by the other system. If this is not the case, do not despair.\nFirst, take time to get on the mat with your new trainee and learn what he has in his repertoire. I strongly suggest that the FTO approach this with an open mind and a willingness to learn rather than adopting the attitude of, “Let me show you what I know because this is what we do here.” You may actually learn something new that you like more- and in which you wish to take the time to become proficient. And, this trainee is likely set in his pattern of action — trying to get him to unlearn something in which he is already proficient can lead to performance errors at critical times.\nNext, do your job as an FTO and pay close attention to field performance. Especially attend to those aspects of subject contact and control that lead to officer injury and death. Specific technique rarely impacts the degree of risk that an officer faces during an arrest situation. More often, officers are attacked and injured because they failed to pick up on the cues presented by the suspect, or they placed themselves in a vulnerable position without adequate time to react.\nInstead of criticizing and getting into a “my kung fu is better than your kung fu” conflict over how a trainee applied handcuffs to a subject, evaluate his avenue of approach and his position of advantage (although those of you who know me know that I don’t believe there is such a thing as a “position of advantage” — there is only a position of “less disadvantage” to you and “less advantage” for the suspect, but that is a topic for another time). Does the trainee make appropriate use of “cover” in all its applications (noun- using barriers that protects against threats; verb- reasonably pointing a weapon at identified threats; adjective- efficiently and effectively acting as backup for fellow officers)? Does he control his distance from the threat and successfully position a subject and his cohorts as the environment dictates?\nIs the trainee following the “tactical M&Ms,” — Maximizing advantage, minimizing exposure, and maintaining the ability to maneuver — while initiating field contacts and responding to calls for service? Is he aware of noise and light discipline while making covert approaches or conducting building searches. Some may ask what these tactics have to do with subject control training. Remember, everything you do (perceive-sense-respond), has everything to do (human factors: reaction time, stress, decision making, memory, etc.), with all that you do (tasks that we perform). It is all about training the mind how to recognize common patterns (schemas) and developing consistent solutions to the problems presented across distinct scenarios.\nDoes your trainee maintain emotional control and demonstrate “command presence” so that he presents himself as a formidable opponent to the suspect who is evaluating whether or not to “give it a go?” Remember, FBI research has identified and interviewed felons who killed one law enforcement officer only after having passed on an attempt with another officer because that officer presented a “tough target” demeanor. When going “hands on” with an individual, does the trainee first scan for threats (hands, waistband, pockets, head-to-toe, surrounding areas) when time allows? Does he make an effort to control both of the subject’s hands? Does he handcuff early when it is reasonable to do so? And, does he conduct a complete and thorough search?\nDo you insist on an answer to the following questions?\n• Do you search first or handcuff first?\n• Do the hands go behind the head or behind the back?\n• Do you cuff the controlled hand or the uncontrolled hand first or do you do a “dual-hand grip” handcuff application?\nIf, however you find yourself in the rare situation where the tactics and techniques that you observe your trainee employ are such an obvious violation of sound common sense practices, then you are probably honor-bound to take corrective action and provide re-training before someone gets injured. Before you do however, notify your chain of command and get",

This is not to say that you cannot teach physical skills, it is simply best left to those who have documented lesson plans for this topic.\nFTO sergeants play an important role in the development and evaluation of the department’s new trainees. First, he has usually been around the block a few more times than the FTO and therefore knows that no one can “control a gorilla on PCP with a wrist lock,” and thus may be less dogmatic about specific techniques. Second, he knows the strengths and weaknesses of various FTOs and can match the trainee up with the best trainer based on the needs of the recruit. Finally, if retraining becomes necessary the sergeant should have the ability to expedite the needed training with a quick phone call due to previously established relationships with department trainers.",

        "prompt": "Emulators for playing older games are immensely popular online, with regular arguments breaking out over which emulator is best for which game. Today we present another point of view from a gentleman who has created the Super Nintendo emulator bsnes. He wants to share his thoughts on the most important part of the emulation experience: accuracy.\nIt doesn't take much raw power to play Nintendo or SNES games on a modern PC; emulators could do it in the 1990s with a mere 25MHz of processing power. But emulating those old consoles accurately—well, that's another challenge entirely; accurate emulators may need up to 3GHz of power to faithfully recreate aging tech. In this piece we'll take a look at why accuracy is so important for emulators and why it's so hard to achieve.\nPut simply, accuracy is the measure of how well emulation software mimics the original hardware. Apparent compatibility is the most obvious measure of accuracy—will an old game run on my new emulator?—but such a narrow view can paper over many small problems. In truth, most software runs with great tolerance to timing issues and appears to be functioning normally even if timing is off by as much as 20 percent.\nSo the question becomes: if we can achieve basic compatibility, why care about improving accuracy further when such improvement comes at a great cost in speed? Two reasons: performance and preservation.\nFirst, performance. Let's take the case of Speedy Gonzales. This is an SNES platformer with no save functionality, and it's roughly 2-3 hours long. At first glance, it appears to run fine in any emulator. Yet once you reach stage 6-1, you can quickly spot the difference between an accurate emulator and a fast one: there is a switch, required to complete the level, where the game will deadlock if a rare hardware edge case is not emulated. One can imagine the frustration of instantly losing three hours of progress and being met with an unbeatable game. Unless the software does everything in the exact same way the hardware used to, the game remains broken.\nOr consider Air Strike Patrol, where a shadow is drawn under your aircraft. This is done using mid-scanline raster effects, which are extraordinarily resource intensive to emulate. But without the raster effects, your aircraft's shadow will not show up, as you see in the screenshot below. It's easy to overlook, especially if you do not know that it is supposed to be there. But once you actually see it, you realize that it's quite helpful. Your aircraft has the ability to drop bombs, and this shadow acts as a sort of targeting system to determine where they will land.—something that's slightly more difficult without this seemingly minor effect.\nThe second issue is preservation. Take a look at Nintendo's Game & Watch hardware. These devices debuted in 1980, and by now most of the 43 million produced have failed due to age or have been destroyed. Although they are still relatively obtainable, their scarcity will only increase, as no additional units will ever be produced. This same problem extends to any hardware: once it's gone, it's gone for good. At that point, emulators are the only way to experience those old games, so they should be capable of doing so accurately.\nThere's nothing wrong with less accurate but speedy emulators, and such code can run on lower-powered hardware like cell phones and handheld gaming devices. These emulators are also more suited for use on laptops where battery life is a concern. But there's something to be said for chasing accuracy, too, and it's what I've attempted to do in my own work. Here's why it matters to me.\nBack in the late '90s, Nesticle was easily the NES emulator of choice, with system requirements of roughly 25MHz. This performance came at a significant cost: game images were hacked to run on this emulator specifically. Fan-made translations and hacks relied on emulation quirks that rendered games unplayable on both real hardware and on other emulators, creating a sort of lock-in effect that took a long while to break. At the time, people didn't care about how the games originally looked and played in general, they just cared about how they looked and played in this arbitrary and artificial environment.\nThese days, the most dominant emulators are Nestopia and Nintendulator, requiring 800MHz and 1.6GHz, respectively, to attain full speed. The need for speed isn't because the emulators aren't well optimized: it's because they are a far more faithful recreation of the original NES hardware in software.\nNow compare these to the older N64 emulator, UltraHLE, whose system requirements were a meager 350MHz Pentium II system. To the casual observer, it can be quite perplexing to see Mario 64 requiring less processing power than the original Mario Bros.\nMy experience in emulation is in the SNES field, working on the bsnes emulator. I adored the ideal behind Nestopia, and wanted to recreate this level of accuracy for the Super Nintendo. As it turns out, the same level of dedication to accuracy pushed requirements up into the 2-3GHz range, depending on the title.\nNestopia caught on because its system requirements were paltry for its time, but I have no doubt that releasing it in 1997 would have been disastrous. Since my emulator ultimately required a computing system with more power than half the market, I've seen first-hand the effect of high system specs and the backlash it causes. It's easier to blame the program than to admit your computer isn't powerful enough, but the reality is that faking an entire gaming console in software is an intensive process.\nSo if an emulator appears to run all games correctly, why should we then improve upon it? The simple answer is because it improves the things we don't yet know about. This is particularly prominent in less popular software.\nAs an example, compare the spinning triforce animation from the opening to Legend of Zelda on the ZSNES and bsnes emulators. On the former, the triforces will complete their rotations far too soon as a result of the CPU running well over 40 percent faster than a real SNES. These are little details, but if you have an eye for accuracy, they can be maddening.\nI've encountered dozens of titles with obscure quirks. Sometimes the correct, more accurate emulation actually produces a \"wrong\" result. Super Bonk's attract mode demo actually desynchronizes, causing Bonk to get stuck near a wall on most real systems. And Starfox suffers from significant slowdown issues throughout the game. These are certainly not desirable attributes, but they are correct nonetheless. We wouldn't round pi down to 3 simply because irrational numbers are inconvenient, right?\nI don't deny the advantages of treating classic games as something that can be improved upon: N64 emulators employ stunning high-resolution texture packs and 1080p upscaling, while SNES emulators often provide 2x anti-aliasing for Mode7 graphics and cubic-spline interpolation for audio samples. Such emulated games look and sound better. While there is nothing wrong with this, it is contrary to the goal of writing a hardware-accurate emulator. These improvement techniques typically make it more difficult even to allow for the option of accurate emulation, in fact.\nAnother major area where accuracy is a benefit is in fan-created works from translators, ROM hackers, and homebrew developers. Few of them have access to run code on real hardware, so they will often develop their software using emulators. Unfortunately, speed-oriented emulators will often ignore hardware limitations. This is never a problem for a commercially developed game: upon required testing on real hardware, the bug would quickly be discovered and fixed. But if you can only test on a specific emulator, such bugs tend to persist.\nI can name a few examples. The fan translations for Dragon Quest 1&2, Dual Orb 2, Sailor Moon: Another Story and Ys 4 all suffered invisible text issues as a result of writing to video RAM while the video processor had it locked out for rendering the screen. Only half of these titles have subsequently been fixed.\nWe've known about this hardware limitation since 1997, which consists of a one-",
        "baseline": "line code fix, but the most popular emulator still does not support this behavior. As a result, translations made solely for this emulator continue to cause problems and lock-in. Who would want to use a more accurate emulator that couldn't run a large number of their favorite fan translations?\nIt doesn't stop there, though. The original hardware had a delay upon asking the math unit for multiplication and division results. Again, any commercial game ever released would respect those delays, but fan hacks led to a Zelda translation's music cutting out and to the Super Mario World chain-chomp patch going haywire.\nOr an emulator might ignore the fact that the sound processor writes echo samples into shared RAM. Not a problem until you wind up with hacks that use wildly unrealistic echo buffer sizes, which in turn end up overwriting the entire audio program in memory, crashing and burning in spectacular fashion. This one issue single-handedly renders dozens of Super Mario World fan-made levels unplayable.",

This is a very small delay, but it's enough to cause a problem when the video processor is busy rendering the screen. The delay is not emulated in any of the popular SNES emulators, and as a result, these games will not work correctly on any of them.\nThe same problem exists in the SNES homebrew game, Super Mario 64 DS, which was developed using the bsnes emulator. The game was tested on real hardware, and the bug was fixed. But the game was also tested on the ZSNES emulator, which does not emulate this delay. As a result, the bug was never discovered, and the game was released with the bug still present.

Players reported that the game would crash when they tried to save their progress. ZSNES was the only emulator that could run the game, and it was the only emulator that ignored the video RAM delay. When the game was tested on real hardware, the bug was quickly discovered and fixed.\nThe point is that if you want to create a game that will run on real hardware, you need to test it on real hardware.

It's a way to ensure that we're not losing anything important in our quest to play these games on the newest devices, and it can help to ensure that we're not losing anything important in our quest to play these games on the newest devices.

Unfortunately, this is a very expensive operation and can slow down the emulator by 10-20 percent. Realistically, the only way to achieve this level of accuracy is to run the game on real hardware.\nThe same is true for the fan translation of Final Fantasy 3. Upon its release, the game was plagued with a bug that made the final boss invincible. Since this was a fan translation, it was not tested on real hardware, and the bug was only discovered after the game was released. But the bug was easily fixed by simply waiting for the delay before writing to video RAM. This is a simple fix, but it took an entire year to discover and fix it.\nFinally, consider homebrew",

        "prompt": "Sometimes it all becomes a little routine.\nHere’s Gonzaga, seriously aiming for a national championship, wading through a conference like the WCC.\nThere just aren’t any Dukes, Virginias and Carolinas to punch you every weekend.\nSo the challenge for the Zags, and something Coach Mark Few must drill into his players almost every day, is to maintain their highest possible level of performance.\nThey simply can’t just go through the motions.\nThat subject came up last week because of the way the schedule was arranged.\nLoyola Marymount, which boasted some decent non-conference wins, visited The Kennel in midweek — a game that offered the Zags a chance to see how far they’ve come, especially with he return of Killian Tillie and Geno Crandall.\nBUT THEN Gonzaga was forced to trek over to Portland on Saturday, a game which was never going to get the juices flowing.\nAnd predictably, after putting away Loyola 73-55 in a game that wasn’t nearly as competitive as the score might indicate, the Zags drifted through Portland on cruise control.\nSure, they had seven players in double figures, and murdered the Pilots on the offensive glass, but Few wouldn’t have been thrilled with the commitment level — just as he wasn’t with the last eight minutes against Loyola Marymount.\nThe Zags beat Portland 89-66 in a routine affair that pushed their record to 18-2 and 5-0 in the WCC.\nIt was ridiculously easy, in part because Portland’s talent is pretty thin, but on top of that the Pilots played a zone — which meant that Rui Hachimura, Brandon Clarke and Killian Tillie could have their way on the offensive boards.\nI’d suspect, though, that Few will be raising his voice a bit during practice this week.\nThe Zags basically allowed free baskets after they’d run up a 29-point lead on Loyola Marymount, and didn’t exactly play with fury against Portland.\nSO WHERE do the returning Tillie and Crandall fit into this picture?\nThe 6-foot-10 Tillie has had some impressive shot-blocking moments, and he’s mobile enough to get out on a smaller player in Gonzaga’s switching defense — but Tillie has been in foul trouble in every game since he’s been back.\nMaybe that’s about finding his rhythm and feel for the game after being out so long, but there’s no question it would make Few more comfortable if Killian could get that “feel” back into his game fairly soon.\nMeanwhile, the almost-forgotten Crandall has slowly become a key piece for the Zags, particularly on defense.\nHe was one of the players who rotated to stifle Loyola Marymount guard James Batemon, who came to Spokane averaging 18 points per game and got just 12 — including a few in garbage time.\nThen against Portland, when guard Marcus Shaver Jr. began to heat up, Crandall was the guy summoned to smother him.\nFew has made it clear that Crandall will have a big role with this team, and now we’re seeing it.\nCrandall is a defensive demon, and let’s not forget that big 3-ball he tossed in at San Francisco when the Zags led just 84-81.\nWhen the two players were injured, fans were dying to get Tillie back on the floor.\nAt the moment, it’s looking as though Crandall may be just as important.\nThe WCC schedule is set up a little oddly this season.\nFor instance, the Zags will have finished their home-and-home duels with San Francisco by Feb. 7.\nThe result of all this is that the conference race — such as it is — could well be over in a couple of weeks.\nWhy does that matter to Gonzaga, which has a pretty decent chance to run the table?\nWell, the Zags are always looking ahead toward March, and the WCC has helped the cause this year by notching several victories against teams from power conferences.\nAll this matters because Gonzaga, as usual, is gunning for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nTHEY WOULD probably answer no, but it never hurts to lock up your case.\nThe puzzle for Few and his staff is whether it’s better to have three or four decent teams all battling to pursue the Zags — or whether San Francisco becomes such a strong No. 2 that the Dons make the NCAA tournament on their own.\nThe Dons, by the way, almost tumbled in a trap game after all the emotion of playing Gonzaga — but they hung on to win 53-52 at Pacific.\nAfter that, it was business as usual as San Francisco thoroughly hammered BYU back on the Hilltop.\nWe mentioned that the WCC might be over in two weeks.\nGonzaga faces a dicey little road swing of its own this week, heading to Santa Clara on Thursday and then to BYU on Saturday.\nWell, never mind what happens to them on the road. There will be 22,000 or thereabouts in the Marriott Center when the Zags come to town. That’s going to be a high-energy game, and BYU has had a bit of success against Gonzaga over the past few years.\nWHILE ALL that’s going on, San Francisco has a breather at home against Portland, then a tricky road trip to San Diego.\nBut remember we said two weeks.\nDuring the first few days of February, the Zags get San Diego at home and then the rematch with San Francisco.\nThe Dons will arrive at The Kennel off a bloodthirsty road test at longtime rival St. Mary’s — where the Gaels finally seem to have come to life.\nHow all these games play out over the next two weeks will decide not only whether the Zags are going to win in a stroll, but if we might see chaos in those 2-3-4 spots.\nAs proof of how weird the schedule looks, San Francisco and St. Mary’s will be facing each other for the second time in three weeks.\nHaving gone over all of these future proceedings, however. the key for Gonzaga is simply to keep winning.\nThe Santa Clara-BYU road trip would be a nice one to survive intact.\nThere’s no question now about Gonzaga having reached elite status in college basketball.\nHey, North Carolina is coming to The Kennel.\nWhat other proof do you need?\nWell, how about grabbing a big trophy for national player of the year?\nGranted, it might be difficult with Duke monster Zion Williamson stomping through the ACC.\nVoter these days also go by some pretty esoteric advanced metrics, numbers that suggest — leaving SportsCenter dunks out of the equation — how valuable players are to their teams.\nIF YOU follow college hoops seriously, you know Ken Pomeroy (kenpom.com), who either invented some of these metrics and ratings, or knows how to use them better than anyone else.\nRight, we’ve established that in voting for this year’s POY (Player of the Year), Williamson is an imposing figure.\nWell, he’s an imposing figure in any situation, but you get what I mean.\nAnd yet, Gonzaga boasts a star whose numbers are insanely close to Zion’s.\nIt shouldn’t surprise you that the Zags would have a POY candidate.\n“It would be an extremely difficult call for me between Williamson and Clarke,” Hamilton said. “To be clear, everyone on your list merits consideration. I really thought going into this process that I’d land on someone other than Zion.\nBut what about all those advanced metrics?\n“The great and very confusing part about college basketball is that we have all these stats to measure how important and valuable guys are to their team,” Hamilton said.",

Dhoni.\nA grassy pitch has greeted the Indians at Perth's WACA Ground, with curator Cam Sutherland predicting the wicket would have more pace and bounce than the corresponding Test against England last year, when seam bowlers dominated and just two of 40 wickets fell to spin.\nDown 2-0 in the four-Test series after losing by 122 runs at the MCG and being thrashed by an innings and 68 runs in Sydney, India are already certain to lose second spot in the ICC Test rankings, but Dhoni said they were desperate to avoid a repeat of last year's 4-0 whitewash in England.\nTheir desperation has them considering the unusual move of playing four pacemen and Dhoni, who normally doesn't take great stock in pitch conditions, said they would reserve their final decision until they inspect the strip just before the match, which starts Friday.\n\"A lot depends on how it looks before the start of the game,\" Dhoni said of the pitch, hinting that spinner Ravi Ashwin could miss the match.\n\"It will affect us to some extent, especially in the bowling department.\n\"We have to see how much grass is taken off and how much rolling is done and how hard the wicket is.\n\"We have to see whether the spinner will get some kind of assistance or not,\" he said.\n\"Our bowling will be structured depending on the wicket.\"\nSutherland said recent hot weather meant the pitch probably wouldn't be as lively as the Indians feared when they arrived, and added that he expected a spinner to gain considerable bounce and some turn.\nIf India go for an all-pace attack, the obvious replacement for Ashwin is 27-year-old medium-pacer Vinay Kumar, who would be making his Test debut, but has played 15 one-day internationals.\nUnfortunately for India, Ashwin has been their second most productive batsman in the series, his 143 runs at 35.75 behind only Sachin Tendulkar.\nDhoni, who said he would consider his own playing future at the end of 2013, again dismissed talk of a rift in the Indian side as purely media speculation.\n\"I have never seen the Indian team fight,\" he said.\n\"And this is one thing we are really proud of.\n\"Our real strength is that we love each other and enjoy each other's successes.\n\"I am really proud of our dressing",

Ethical business conduct is a moral imperative for your organization, and it may be required by law. Your obligations are likely to vary, however, depending upon which stakeholders you consider.\nStakeholders can be any person or organization that has a vested interest in what your business does. Employees, customers, shareholders, board members, and even members of the community, can all be affected by what you and your organization does. Your responsibilities to each will vary.\nAs an employer, you have a moral obligation to offer your employees fair pay and reasonable work expectations, while also providing a safe work environment. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration outlines specific rules about workplace safety, while the Americans with Disabilities Act explains the accommodations you must provide to those who have disabilities. Beyond the basics, though, you should have a way for your employees to address grievances in the workplace. Even if you don’t have a formal HR Department, you’ll want to have someone in charge of making sure that employees are treated fairly and with respect.\nYou may also want to have a communication channel that keeps employees informed. Whether your organization is growing or is facing likely layoffs, the ethically moral thing to do is to let your employees know so they don’t feel blindsided. Set up quarterly meetings to keep everyone informed of what's happening and answer questions in a forthright manner. If things aren't going well, let your employees know how you might assist them, such as offering worker retraining or providing career services.\nProviding your customers with good quality at a fair price is both an ethically and financially responsible path. Whatever product or service you produce, you should give your customers what you promise. There are many recent examples of companies doing quite the opposite, whether it’s for-profit schools using unscrupulous marketing tactics and promising larger-than-life results from the diplomas they offer or Wells Fargo and similar companies committing outright fraud by creating false accounts. Be honest, be fair. And your customers will reward you with purchases and brand loyalty.\nIf you’ve ever worked for a large, publicly traded company, you already understand the ethical requirements from governmental bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. But even if your business has no shareholders, you may have a board of director or an advisory board.

        "prompt": "The recovery is back! Or maybe not.\nOn Thursday morning, the U.S. Commerce Department said the nation’s gross domestic product rose 2.5% in the third quarter, nearly double the 1.3% rate it had risen in the quarter before. And the growth was far better than many economists thought it would be just a few months ago. In the doldrums of the mid-summer many people were predicting that the economy would soon slide back into recession. That doesn’t seem to be happening, at least for now.\nEven more encouraging was where the growth came from – corporate America. There was a huge surge in business spending, up more than 17%. Consumer spending was up as well, but not nearly as much. Of note, though, is that consumer spending rose faster than incomes. That’s not a great thing on an individual level. Savings was down. But for the economy in the short-term it’s a good sign. Consumers appear to be regaining some measure of optimism. And in a consumer driven economy we need confidence.\nStill, for a number of economists today’s news wasn’t enough wipe away their general pessimism about the economy. Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said the growth was temporary and would soon fade. Nigal Gault at IHS Global Insight said the most likely outlook for the U.S. is continued weak growth. Josh Bivens of the think tank the Economic Policy Institute said that “the strongest growth in a year was still not strong enough.” NBER economist Justin Wolfers said the recovery has been delayed another quarter.\nWhat are all these economists so worried about?\nAgain, it comes back to corporate spending. A number said the surge in business spending was not sustainable. Corporations, though, are sitting on hoards of cash. It was often cited as the reason the economy would pull out of recession. In fact, a common question during the recession has been why aren’t companies spending more. Now that businesses are finally spending I don’t get why people believe it will stop so quickly. The deep recession caused companies to put off many projects and business investment in general. They made do with lean staffs for a longer period than",

And many economists were right to point out that at 2.5% it would be a long time before the unemployment rate gets back to pre-recession levels. And I mean a long, long time. A recent analysis from the Atlanta Fed shows that at 2.5% growth, we still wouldn’t be close to full employment a decade from now. But here’s my problem with analysis like that. Economies don’t tend to stay in one place. If the recovery is back, growth will probably accelerate. If it’s not, growth will slow, and Washington will eventually have to do something.\nMy guess is that the recovery will happen by surprise. It will probably be in full force long before anyone realizes it. That’s what usually happens, and could be happening already.",

It’s not a huge jump, but it’s a start.\nThe other thing that’s been holding back the economy is the housing market. It’s still in the dumps. But there are signs that it’s finally starting to turn around. The Commerce Department said new home sales rose 5.7% in September. That’s the biggest jump in more than a year. And it’s the second straight month of gains. The median price of a new home also rose, up 3.5% from a year ago. That’s the first year-over-year increase since 2007.\nThe housing market is still a long way from recovery. But it’s a start. And it’s a sign that the economy is finally starting to turn around.",

High-quality clinical trials are needed to prove its efficacy as a skin whitener. Its safety as a skin whitener has not yet been firmly established,” Asuncion said.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medical use of IV glutathione to protect cancer patients from the side effects of a platinum-based chemotherapy. It warned the public as early as May 2011 against the use of IV glutathione to whiten skin due to its possible adverse effects.\nA recent PDS study documented at least 69 patients who suffered from complications due to IV glutathione use, ranging from dizziness, increased blood sugar and easy bruising to difficulty in breathing and gastritis.\nIn the worst case, a 34-year",

        "prompt": "Janelle Monáe is on her third, maybe fourth life, a striking fact given that she’s been an avowed futurist from the very start. For almost a decade, she’s been treating R&B and funk as technologies badly in need of updating, planning for their cyborg future and waiting for everyone else to catch up.\nBut in the same way that hip-hop is able to manifest its politics without overtness, much of the music Ms. Monáe has been fiddling with is also comfortably next-wave without advertising itself as such. In this environment, Ms. Monáe’s sleek eccentricity has often felt overwrought, or at minimum, inessential.\nWhich is perhaps why, over the last few months, Ms. Monáe has retreated to the present, or sometimes, to the past. Her thumping, au courant single “Yoga” was the first song on which she was the lead artist to crack the Billboard Hot 100. That song features a protégé, the rapper and singer Jidenna, who has an actual breakout pop-rap hit, the dandy theme song “Classic Man,” which takes Ms. Monáe’s tomorrow template and applies it to preaching the benefits of yesteryear.\nThey can both be found on “Wondaland Presents: The Eephus” (Wondaland/Epic), the spotty compilation from Ms. Monáe’s Wondaland label that was released on Friday. (Eephus is a reference to that unpredictable, often unhittable baseball pitch.) On Thursday night, the whole Wondaland massive — Ms. Monáe, Jidenna, Roman GianArthur, the funk-rock duo Deep Cotton and the acoustic soul duo St. Beauty — convened at the Highline Ballroom for a group show, artists flowing on and off stage, in and out of one another’s sets.\nThe concert, like the EP, showed a crew brimming with ideas, though often with execution falling short of the aesthetic. Onstage Ms. Monáe is a lightning bolt, vibrating at a unique frequency. Here, in a white jumpsuit with black accents, her hair in a pouf jumping out atop her head, she delivered old songs like “Tightrope” and “Electric Lady” with church fervor.\n“Yoga,” though, is vexing. It’s a glamour hippie celebration, and also a strip-club ready anthem, with one showstopping line that functions in either setting: “You cannot police me/ So get off my areola.” Perhaps Ms. Monáe is winking, trying to camouflage herself with this song, which sounds as if it was written for Beyoncé’s last album — or worse, immediately in its wake.\nFor continuity, there was a band playing throughout the concert, with varying degrees of intensity, though in part it had the unintended effect of smoothing out the differences among the artists. In addition to Ms. Monáe and Jidenna, there was the rowdy, fun and unfocused Deep Cotton; the shamanistic, meditative and slightly stern St. Beauty (who performed a dry cover of Sheryl Crow’s “Strong Enough”); and Mr. GianArthur, a good singer and better guitar player.\nJidenna has made politics central to his mission, though not exactly in the same way. In the “Classic Man” video, there is an awkward segment in which Jidenna sees some young men being rousted by cops, intervenes on their behalf, then brings them to a kind of gentleman academy, in what feels like a dose of respectability politics incarnate.\nBefore he found",

Now he’s a walking period piece, in three-piece suits, club collars, pocket watch stowed primly in his waistcoat pocket, hair slicked into a swooping wave.\nBefore “Classic Man,” Jidenna performed a new song, “Some Kind of Way,” that with its innocuous calypso-lite beat isn’t far from the tropical house music that’s beginning to saunter onto the pop charts, as seen in the Felix Jaehn remix of Omi’s “Cheerleader.” But there were also flickers of Bobby McFerrin, maybe even Harry Belafonte.

Click here to register now!\nFor 2018, we’ve going to do a deep dive into grassroots organizing with the NORML Activist Strategy Summit. Attendees will be able to choose from a number of important areas of interest and engage in free-flowing, peer to peer strategizing on issues including running an effective chapter, communications strategy, social media and online activism, and more. Each topic area will be moderated by outstanding NORML activists from across the country paired with a member of the National staff and provide an outlet for individuals to share stories based on their advocacy experiences, exchange tips for best practices, and come up with new concepts to put into play to help push us closer to the end of prohibition.\nTopics include: Organizing political candidate forums, “big organizing” for lobby days, personal narrative development, and more.\nOn Monday, July 23rd we will host our formal conference programming. There will be panels, debates, and individual speakers covering a wide range of topics including: marijuana and its impact on the opioid crisis, how to engage in local reform efforts, NORML’s role in the 2018 midterms, marijuana reform as a social justice issue, and updates current 2018 ballot initiative efforts.\nIn the evening, attendees will gather for a NORML benefit party to enjoy live entertainment and networking.\nFor the final day, NORML supporters will once again descend upon Congress to advocate for federal reforms.

Scores of innocent people who came to this country in the hope of bettering their lot have been deprived of their hard-won livelihoods simply because they were born elsewhere. South Africans should be outraged and profoundly ashamed about this. However, if anything, the response from the street has been to somehow try to justify the attacks. Going by the comments on late night radio talk shows, engrained beliefs about foreigner establishments undercutting local businesses, being fronts for drug peddling, failing to pay taxes, not employing locally-born South Africans and the like continue to be widely held.\nIt has hardly helped that certain people in authority have sought to play down what has happened and tried to depict the looting as being simply criminally motivated.

Considerable fury was generated by Le Grange having tweeted — what exactly? Essentially, she was expressing resentment over comments that, in her view, suggested that government regarded whites as being unwelcome in South Africa. At worst, it could be seen as a “Vintage White Whine”, in which the writer read too much into what were a few isolated incidents and overreacted accordingly. Adjudging the tweets to be “racist”, however, was nonsense. Such thinking only creates the ridiculous situation where any complaint (justified or not) about discrimination against whites is automatically construed as being motivated by racism against blacks.\nNo-one was harmed by the tweets, nor, in reality, should they have resulted in much more than a little annoyance.

        "prompt": "I was disturbed at what I recently witnessed at a Buffalo Bills football game. The Bills hosted their cross-state rival, the New York Jets, in Orchard Park, N.Y. I had attended many Bills games years ago, but this was different. The young fans seemed hopeless, yet searching for hope.\nMy father had owned season tickets to the Buffalo Bills for about 20 years after the opening of Rich Stadium in 1973, and I often attended games with him. My parents were accomplished tailgaters who welcomed friends to celebrate at their camper. The joyful pregame atmosphere was accented by people tossing footballs, blaring music, red and blue everything and the tantalizing smell of grilled meats.\nBut it was different this time, many years later. Everywhere we looked, my 18-year-old son, my brother, and I saw drunken youth and the crude expressions of their woozy state of mind.\n\"I hope you get raped!\" yelled a 20-something woman to another 20-something female who was wearing a Jets jersey.\nThirty yards away, a drunken, bare-chested, obese young man stood on the bed of a flatbed truck waving a giant Bills flag with his right hand while downing yet another beer with his left hand at 10:30 a.m. He was accompanied by a friend wearing a Bills jersey waving an equally large American flag.After having a few bowls of our host's special chili, we made our way to the stadium surrounded by throngs of young people in a drunken stupor.We took our seats in the upper deck. Again, omnipresent drunkenness. I spoke with a happy young couple with glazed-over eyes throughout the game. Another pleasant young couple cheering for the Jets was comfortably numb for four quarters. Later in the game, another disturbance broke out. A man with the bloodiest face I've ever seen emerged from the crowd escorted by Bills security.\nThere was one moment that reminded me of the old days. At the beginning of the game, members of the military unrolled an American flag that covered the entire football field and everyone stood to sing the National Anthem respectfully, almost reverently.\nLater, the Buffalo Bills cheerleaders performed a dance number wearing military boots, camouflage pants, and skintight black shirts. The fans went wild for this contemporary sexualized patriotic display. But still, it was a",
        "baseline": " form of patriotism and my mind flashed back to the flag-waving guys in the back of the truck. Was there a connection, a common thread? Although the Bills were victorious, the day was defined by youthful drunkenness and patriotism. But was there more underlying this unsettling culture?\nWas the excessive drinking an expression of hopelessness and a desperate search for happiness? Maybe. On the other hand, was the patriotism an expression of hope in something bigger than oneself - community and country? I think it was.\nAlthough I left the stadium disturbed, I'm hopeful because I think the drunken youth were searching for a reason to be happy and hopeful. That's good. Although the NFL season will end soon, this is the season of hope when we celebrate the birth of a child, the joy of man's desiring, the desire of all nations and the prince of peace upon whose shoulders rests a government that will increase forever. This is the best hope for young and old tailgaters.",

He also upped his career record against St. Louis to 7-2, and is 4-0 in six career road starts against the Cardinals with an earned run average of 2.07.\n\"I didn't know that,\" he said of his career success in St. Louis. \"I just go out there and compete, try to keep my team in the game.\"\nPittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle was asked what Liriano likes about pitching in the Cardinals' spacious ballpark.\n\"Obviously, he likes a lot about this place,\" Hurdle said. \"His fastball played so well, especially later in the game. His pitch efficiency, command, good rhythm ... he gave us the kind of start we needed.\"\nLiriano picked up 12 outs on only 38 pitches from the third through sixth innings, and never seemed in any danger until a weird sequence in the bottom of the seventh enabled the Cardinals to climb back into contention.\nWith Randal Grichuk at second and Aledmys Diaz at first and pinch-hitter Ruben Tejada hitting, Liriano spiked a pitch about 10 feet in front of catcher Francisco Cervelli and the ball bounced almost to the St. Louis dugout behind first base.\nGrichuk was able to score from second, using a headfirst slide to maneuver around Liriano's tag attempt at the plate, and Diaz made third. Tejada's sacrifice fly three pitches later drew the Cardinals within 3-2.\nBut Jung Ho Kang, playing his first game of the year with the Pirates (16-13) after completing a 13-game rehab assignment for Triple-A Indianapolis, cranked out his second homer in the eighth off the third deck's facing in left field for a valuable insurance run.\nIn his previous at-bat, Kang gave Pittsburgh a 3-0 advantage by ambushing a first-pitch fastball from reliever Tyler Lyons for a two-run blast into the St. Louis bullpen. It was the second two-homer game in Kang's career.\nKang hit just .150 in 40 at-bats on his rehab stint, but Hurdle wasn't surprised that he was such a factor against major league pitching.\n\"I've seen it before,\" Hurdle said. \"A guy named (George) Brett, when we didn't have rehab (assignments), he went 4-for-4 with a homer. A lot of people like to place limitations on a player. You never know what's going to happen. We're going to plug him in and let him go.\"\nKang's first two at-bats resulted in first-pitch outs, including a fourth-inning pop-up with the bases loaded that was the last out Cardinals starter Carlos Martinez (4-2) notched.\nAs he threw ball one to the next hitter, Josh Harrison, Martinez bent over in front of the mound. Players went over to check on him, followed by the trainer and manager Mike Matheny. Martinez departed the mound moments later due to fatigue.\nMartinez was feeling under the weather during a 6 2/3-inning start Sunday against Washington and took it easy during his four days between outings.\n\"I felt like I'd make the start with full strength,\" he said through an interpreter, \"but obviously not.\"\nMartinez lasted 3 1/3 innings, giving up three hits and a run with three walks and two strikeouts.

The German electronics and engineering group acquired American oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand in a $7.6 billion deal in September.\n\"We are not in here for a quarter, we are not in for short-term aspects of the oil price, we do believe this is a good space to be because we can bring the expertise from automation and electrification into the oil and gas space so we feel very comfortable in what we see,\" Kaeser said.\nHis comments came as the company reported net income of 1.095 billion euros ($1.22 billion) in the first quarter, down from 1.457 billion euros in 2014, as its power and gas unit was hit by a weaker global economy and oil price. Profit at the unit fell 39 percent in the first three months of the year.\nShares of Siemens were 2.4 percent Tuesday morning.\nBut Kaeser told CNBC that he was optimistic that a lower oil price would provide additional opportunities.\n\"If the oil price is down that certainly will boost sentiment with lower gas prices at the pump so this will give a positive impact into the automotive industry,\" he said.\n\"We also believe that oil importing countries, such as emerging markets will massively benefit from a lower oil price bill and that will go into the infrastructure build-up in those countries.

        "prompt": "The next President of the United States will enter office facing as daunting and diverse a set of foreign policy challenges as any President in recent times: Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea; an unpredictable nuclearized North Korea; Russian belligerence in neighboring nations and renewed influence in the Middle East; Iranian hegemonic ambitions; dangerous and powerful Islamist terror groups, such as ISIS and a host of al-Qaeda affilates; instability in Syria and Libya, with the resulting refugee crises impacting not only neighboring countries, but wide swaths of Europe; rising instability and Islamist terrorism in Africa accompanied by eroding adherence to democracy; economic instability and major corruption in Venezuela; rampant criminality in Mexico; global intelligence espionage; and an ongoing economic malaise in major European economies and Japan. All of these challenges and more will confront America’s next Commander in Chief literally on day one.\nThe State Department seems to lurch from disaster to distraction, responding to many crises but preventing few. Its influence in Washington, and American diplomatic influence globally, is waning….\nWith the rise of large, permanent defense and intelligence bureaucracies after World War II, and the more recent increase in size and stature of the National Security Council begun under Henry Kissinger and expanded since, State’s role is ever more constrained. Its regional and thematic policy experts are often muscled out of big decisions by other parts of the executive branch.\nOnly if the State Department’s internal weaknesses are cured will it become an effective leader in the making and implementation of the nation’s foreign policy. Only then can it credibly seek significant funding increases from Congress. The department suffers in particular from an ineffective organizational structure in which regional and functional policies do not serve integrated goals, and in which sound management, accountability, and leadership are lacking. For this and other reasons, the power to determine national security policy has steadily migrated toward the National Security Council (NSC) staff.\nToo often, those lamenting the problems in the Department of State attribute it primarily to a lack of resources. But Congress and the Bush and Obama Administrations have provided the State Department with significantly more resources in the 15 years since the Hart–Rudman Commission. Both in terms of budget and personnel, State is better resourced than was the case at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, during the mid-1990s, or at the end of the Cold War. Yet, the perception of State Department inadequacy remains, and indicates that the Hart–Rudman Commission was right to conclude that simply increasing resources will not address concerns about the impact, focus, and efficiency of the Department of State. Deficiencies in influence, responsiveness, and effectiveness in the State Department have to be addressed through improved leadership, structure, and organization, and clarity of mission.\nI guarantee you more than 50 percent of the history of this era is going to be written out of that 1 percent and the issues we confront in that 1 percent. And I ask you to think about that as you contemplate the budgets. Because we’ve been robbing Peter to pay Paul.... We’ve been diminishing our capacity to be able to have the kind of impact we ought to be having in this more complicated world.\nThis budgetary argument is a red herring. Adequate or inadequate funding of the State Department has nothing to do with spending on other departments or programs. Arguments can be made that more funding is necessary to meet certain goals or to sustain current operations, but this has nothing to do with overall federal spending except in the obvious context that resources are finite.\nA more useful metric is whether the State Department is receiving more or less funding than it has previously. Analysis of budget data trends indicates that current State Department funding is considerably higher than in previous years.\nEven with the slight decline in recent years due to sequestration, funding for the total International Affairs budget—the overall 150 account which funds the State Department; foreign information and exchange services; international financial programs; and most humanitarian, economic, and security assistance—was 92.6 percent higher than in fiscal year (FY) 2005 (60 percent in constant 2009 dollars); 146.9 percent higher than in FY 1995 (68.7 percent in constant 2009 dollars); and 236.4 percent higher than in FY 1990 at the end of the Cold War (102.8 percent in constant 2009 dollars).\nLikewise, Conduct of Foreign Affairs—the part of the budget that funds the costs and operations of the Department of State—was 46.7 percent higher in FY 2015 than in FY 2005 (21.9 percent in constant 2009 dollars); 250.6 percent higher than in FY 1995 (139.6 percent in constant 2009 dollars); and 386.1 percent higher than in FY 1990 at the end of the Cold War (193.1 percent in constant 2009 dollars).\nThere is also a common perception that the State Department is understaffed, which inhibits its performance, and requires hiring more Foreign Service and Civil Service employees. Foreign Service and Civil Service employees at the State Department do valuable and serious work, including shaping and implementing America’s foreign policy, engaging in diplomatic relations and negotiations, processing visas, and offering day-to-day support of Americans abroad. These employees are essential, and U.S. foreign policy depends on sufficient trained personnel. However, the data clearly indicate that personnel levels in the State Department have grown significantly over the past two decades.\nAccording to the FY 2016 Congressional Budget Justification, the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) employ more than 72,000 people in the U.S., and 280 missions and facilities in nearly every country in the world. A large number of these employees are locally employed staff, including Foreign Service Nationals, but, as illustrated in Chart 2, the number of core staff that manages and fulfills the responsibilities of the State Department—Foreign Service and Civil Service employees—has significantly increased. In fact, total employment of those two employee categories has risen by more than 87 percent between 1995 and 2015.\nIn summary, the data indicate that the State Department has significantly more resources at its disposal than was the case at the end of the Cold War, in the mid-1990s, and at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The deficiencies of the State Department cannot be attributed to shrinking or static resources. The reason for the perceived failings and ineffectiveness of the State Department, instead, lie elsewhere. While poor leadership and misguided policies can obviously impede even the best organizations, consideration must also be given to how existing and expanded resources have been allocated—particularly the expansion of the State Department’s focus beyond its traditional remit and the emphasis on those non-traditional responsibilities. Providing more resources without addressing these issues will not resolve the lack of effectiveness of the State Department.\nCorrectly or incorrectly, the State Department has been perceived as having internal political biases and entrenched institutional policy preferences and positions that make it difficult for Presidents to elicit enthusiastic support for policies that do not comport with those preferences. These general frustrations have been exacerbated by the urgency of pressures faced by modern Presidents. Recent Administrations have addressed this issue through increased political appointments, which are resented by career State Department employees who see it as limiting opportunities for their own advancement and, generally, eroding professionalism, effectiveness, and availability of institutional and practical skills and experience. To increase their direct control over foreign policy and their perceived capacity to deal with fast-evolving crises, modern Presidents have also increasingly empowered and expanded the size of the National Security Council (NSC).\nThe original NSC, established in 1947, comprised only a handful of key advisers to the President. It grew slowly at first. Total NSC staff did not exceed 20 until the 1970s, or 60 until the mid-1990s. The size of the NSC spiked in the late 1990s and stabilized at roughly 100 staff in the post-9/11 period. NSC growth resumed in the latter part of the George W. Bush Administration, and this trend has accelerated under President Barack Obama. Currently, the NSC staff is estimated to be over 400 people, more than twice the number at the end of the Bush Administration. This growth has been a direct result of the President relying more on the NSC to devise and implement his foreign policy than on the Department of State.\nThe 24-hour news cycle has thrust many issues, no matter how trivial, into the limelight, making them the President’s responsibility. The news media expect every tactical detail, from the timing of a raid on a terrorist bunker to the targets of drone attacks, to be known and controlled by the President. As a result, the NSC staff gets overly involved not only in the minutiae of operations, but also in politics. It begins to operate more as a personal White House staff than as an advisory and policy coordination staff, sometimes even to the point of acting like a Praetorian Guard for the President’s political fortunes, which is particularly inappropriate given that many people on the staff are career civil servants from national security agencies rather than political appointees. The results are quite often disastrous.\nAlong the same lines, Presidents have also felt the need at times to appoint personal confidants or representatives to address pressing issues. When the President relies too often or too heavily on individual “czars” or “envoys” to address discrete issues, however, he risks undermining clarity and consistency of policy, distorting the importance of issues in the overall spectrum of U.S. foreign policy interests, and confusing both U.S. and foreign officials about the chain of command through the multiple lines of communication to the President.\nAppoint the appropriate Secretary of State for the President. Obviously, every President should endeavor to appoint a competent and knowledgeable person as Secretary of State. But other qualities are vitally important as well. In particular, if foreign policy is to be led from the State Department, the Secretary must enjoy the trust and confidence of the President. Similarly, the Secretary should trust his or her team to competently fulfill its responsibilities. The personal presence or participation of the Secretary of State in negotiations should be the rare exception, not a common occurrence. If the Secretary spends as much time traveling as in Washington managing the department, it is a sign that something is amiss. Moreover, the Secretary of State should be willing and, ideally, eager, to work as part of the overall foreign policy team—as the primary lead—to avoid the turf wars and infighting that can paralyze the interagency process and tempt the President to rely disproportionally on the National Security Advisor or other advisers and czars.\nReduce the operational role of the NSC and place those responsibilities chiefly on Under and Assistant Secretaries of State. If the State Department is to resume its historical role in foreign policy and the NSC to revert to its traditional advisory and coordinating function, the need for a large NSC staff recedes. Instead, the operational lead should be the responsibility of the State Department’s Under and Assistant Secretaries. These positions should be filled by experienced career and political appointees capable of briefing the President on situations and presenting policy recommendations arrived at through interagency coordination.\nReturn the Policy Planning Staff to its original purpose, or eliminate it. The Policy Planning Staff was set up in 1947 to serve as an internal source of independent policy analysis and advice for the Secretary—similar to an internal State Department think tank. Indeed, the main purpose of the Policy Planning Staff, according to former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, was to “anticipate the emerging form of things to come, to reappraise policies which had acquired their own momentum and went on after the reasons for them had ceased, and to stimulate and, when necessary, to devise basic policies crucial to the conduct of our foreign affairs.” The Policy Planning Staff has not realized this purpose and, instead, has become more of a glorified speech writing staff and parking place for political assistants. If more speechwriters and political assistants are necessary, they should be employed in the Office of the Chief of Staff or the Executive Secretariat. As to the original intended purpose, if the Policy Planning Staff actually operated as a dedicated research and advisory staff on diplomacy and foreign policy, it could be useful. However, there is an abundance of independent diplomatic and foreign policy analysis and advice in the current era both from private-sector think tanks and academia and from government-funded institutions, such as the Institute of Peace. If it is to be retained, the Policy Planning Staff should provide unique value or fill critical gaps, not seek to replicate skills or work that is available elsewhere in government or outside of it.\nThere is no point in the United Nations Ambassador sitting around, as I did for a while, talking about ag policy. If there’s an N.S.C. meeting or a Cabinet meeting that impacts on the mission at the United Nations, Ambassador Pickering will be at the table.… I want to have an orderly flow in foreign policy making [and] the Ambassador should report, in my view, to the President through the Secretary of State.\nAs a practical matter, President George H. W. Bush was aware that cabinet-level rank inevitably leads the Ambassador to spend a significant amount of time in Washington, often on issues well outside his or her direct remit, taking away from responsibilities in New York. Another concern, however, is the risk of encouraging the Ambassador to view himself as a policymaking peer to the Secretary of State. This can foment tension and divisiveness and undermine department hierarchy. As observed by former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton, “[Y]ou shouldn’t have two secretaries in the same department.” Indeed, to better coordinate policy and re-establish proper lines of authority, the Permanent Representatives and the Missions to the United Nations should be brought under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs.\nCurtail the use of special envoys and special representatives. Special envoys have a long history, dating back to the earliest days of the republic when John Monroe helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase at the behest of President Thomas Jefferson. Historically, Presidents periodically have sought to tap the expertise of high-level, experienced diplomats who can apply clout, perspective, and relationships to better resolve particularly challenging matters. Under the current Administration, however, there has been a proliferation of special envoys and representatives of relatively minor stature to address a host of issues great and small, narrow and expansive. Currently, more than 60 special envoys, special representatives, coordinators, special advisers, and other senior officials are charged with leading numerous discrete issues. Some of these appointees focus on current crises, such as in Syria and Libya. Others, however, focus on broad thematic causes, such as global food security, international labor affairs, international disability rights, global youth issues, and climate change. Most of these senior officials are appointed by the President without need for Senate confirmation or consultation—and, hence, little oversight and accountability to the American people.\nThere are benefits of these political appointees: They can focus on discrete issues, they demonstrate executive branch dedication to the issue, they can circumvent existing lines of authority when there are disputes among agencies, and their special status can grant access not available to lower-level officials. However, these senior officials frequently see themselves as direct representatives of the Secretary or even the President with the authority to act outside of normal State Department lines of authority. This can foment tensions with the existing State Department bureaucracy with overlapping responsibilities, undermine the authority of U.S. Ambassadors, and create confusion for foreign governments as to who actually represents the President.\nMoreover, the proliferation of special envoys and other appointees is symptomatic of the dysfunction and dissatisfaction with the performance of the Department of State. If the President was confident in the ability of the State Department to address these matters effectively through the existing structure, there would be infrequent need for creating these types of appointments outside the core bureaucracy. More practically, the proliferation of special envoys and other senior appointments is duplicative and adds additional costs because even if they are unpaid, most require separate, additional funds for support staff, offices and equipment, travel, and other expenses.\nWhile these positions can be of use in some instances, they should not be used as an alternative to existing, but underperforming, options within the existing bureaucracy. Moreover, they should focus on immediate crises requiring intervention by a high-level presidential representative and should be eliminated upon resolving the current issue, or if progress is deemed unlikely or can be better or equally addressed through existing structures. The default option should be to assign responsibility to Ambassadors or officials whose responsibilities emcompass or overlap with the matter at hand.\nThere are sometimes good reasons for Presidents to appoint confidants and trusted advisers to key positions in important countries overseas. Indeed, in a number of instances, an Ambassador known to be a direct, personal representative of the Secretary of State or the President can be more effective than even the most knowledgeable and experienced career Foreign Service Officer. Early in the post-election transition, the next Administration should identify critical postings that merit placement of experienced high-level foreign policy hands or personal confidants of the President.\nThis process should not devolve into rewarding political supporters. The temptation to succumb to political patronage and reward unqualified individuals with plum posts in desirable locations has affected every Administration to a greater or lesser degree and, sometimes, to the detriment of the nation. The historical ratio of 68 percent career Foreign Service Officers versus 32 percent political appointees should serve as a guide on these matters. (See Table 1.) Ultimately, however, the most important factor is to appoint the most capable Ambassadors, whether career or political, and vet appointees to ensure that they are well-qualified even if they are nominated for ceremonial positions or ambassadorships in countries of minimal importance. Needless to say, this would enhance the effectiveness of America’s foreign policy, improve morale among those in the State Department who work with and support U.S. Ambassadors, and foster respect among foreign governments and people.\nIncrease Foreign Service assignments from three to five years. Assignments for State Department Foreign Service employees typically last for three years. This is done to allow those in undesirable assignments to move on relatively quickly and to provide the broadest number of distinct work experiences while still ensuring that individuals are able to make substantive contributions. However, this relatively short duration hinders productive capacity. A substantial portion of the first year is spent learning the ropes, while a substantial portion of the final year is spent seeking and securing the most desirable new assignment possible. In essence, a three-year deployment involves only 18 months to 24 months of full-time contribution from a fully capable employee. Five-year assignments would increase the productive time per assignment.\nConduct an in-depth evaluation of standards, training, and qualifications for both the Foreign Service and Civil Service. There has been an increasing tendency to blur the lines between the Foreign Service and Civil Service in the State Department.[ 28] This may not always be appropriate as some positions demand specified skills and training. A thorough evaluation should be conducted to determine which positions require Foreign Service expertise and which can or should be filled by Civil Service employees and reserve them as appropriate. In addition, an independent analysis should be conducted to determine if the five Foreign Service career tracks or “cones” (Consular Officers, Economic Officers, Management Officers, Political Officers, and Public Diplomacy Officers) remain relevant and properly oriented to meet the current and anticipated needs of the Department of State. In addition, a more rigorous system should be developed for performance evaluation, career education and re-certification, and pre-entry requirements, including emphasizing three years to five years of work experience in the military, private sector, or in the legislative or judiciary branches of government to expand the professional diversity of State Department officials.\nThe State Department consists primarily of regional and functional bureaus and offices. The regional bureaus deal with bilateral relations between the U.S. and other countries and also lead initiatives that are regionally focused. The functional bureaus typically deal with thematic issues, such as economics, arms control, human rights, migration, environmental issues, counterterrorism, and other issues that do not have a particular national or regional focus.\nAlthough there is general consistency over time, particularly in the regional bureaus, there has been a gradual shift in the State Department structure to expand the number, size, and resources of the non-regional bureaus. This shift has resulted in a proliferation of the number of functional and managerial bureaus, departments, and offices. Additions in recent presidencies, for instance, include the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, the Bureau of Energy Resources, the Office of Global Women’s Issues, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the Office of Global Criminal Justice.\nThe State Department’s own effort to cover all the various aspects of national security policy—economic, transnational, regional, security—has produced an exceedingly complex organizational structure. Developing a distinct “State” point of view is now extremely difficult and this, in turn, has reduced the department’s ability to exercise any leadership.\nOver the past decade, the impulse to create individual functional bureaus was useful substantively and politically; e.g., in the cases of human rights, democracy, law enforcement, refugees, political-military affairs, and nonproliferation. The problem is that overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness have been lost in the process….\nAs a result of these many deficiencies, confidence in the department is at an all-time low. A spiral of decay has unfolded over many years in which the Congress, reacting to inefficiencies within the department, has consistently underfunded the nation’s needs in the areas of representation overseas and foreign assistance. That underfunding, in turn, has deepened the State Department’s inadequacies. This spiral must be reversed.\nEstablish an Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. Although the U.S. might prefer otherwise, diplomatic, economic, and security matters are increasingly discussed, negotiated, implemented, and acted upon through multilateral initiatives or in international organizations. This reality is reflected in the proliferation of functional bureaus assigned to address many of these issues, which at times lead to conflict and competition with the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (located in the current structure among the regional bureaus under the authority of the Under Secretary for Political Affairs) that is charged with addressing many of these matters through U.S. policy in the United Nations system. The bureaucratic separation of these matters from the traditional diplomatic engagement of the regional bureaus can create gaps and conflicts in policy priorities. There needs to be better coordination of U.S. policy on multilateral matters that balances thematic and ideological efforts with practical diplomatic concerns and an empowerment of U.S. professionals engaged in these critical activities. To realize this, the next President should create an Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs who would coordinate and direct U.S. policy in international organizations and on multilateral efforts, responsibility for which is primarily placed in the functional bureaus, as is currently the case for human rights, democracy promotion, refugees, and international environmental issues. In addition, to better coordinate multilateral policy, the U.S. Missions to the United Nations in New York, Geneva, and elsewhere should report to and through this Under Secretary via the Assistant Secretary of International Organization Affairs.\nIn addition to improving coordination, this restructuring would also elevate the value of experience in multilateral diplomacy. U.S. Foreign Service Officers are encouraged to accumulate broad, disperate experiences to advance within the department. This can be a great asset as it provides a wide-ranging knowledge base, but the failure to emphasize multilateral diplomacy can be a disadvantage when facing counterparts who may have served decades in the same organization focusing on narrow or technical matters with the historical knowledge that such experience provides. To make clear their respective roles, the position of Under Secretary for Political Affairs should be retitled to Under Secretary for Bilateral Affairs.\nShift the responsibilities of most functional bureaus to the Under Secretary for Bilateral Affairs and the Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. To address the disconnect and division between the regional and functional bureaus, the Hart–Rudman Commission suggested creating five regional Under Secretaries along with Under Secretaries for Global Affairs and Management. The functional bureaus were to be subsumed into this structure. That recommendation correctly identified a key problem, but perhaps proposed an overly radical restructuring. Requiring closer coordination among the offices leading U.S. policy on these issues would better ensure that they are incorporated into a broader U.S. diplomatic and foreign policy framework without creating a zero-sum game in terms of resource allocation between bureaus. Indeed, organizational consolidation could create a positive budgetary impact through the elimination of unnecessary positions. Moreover, it would also likely increase efficiency and effectiveness in the bureaucracy by simplifying the spaghetti bowl of competing lines of authority within the State Department. Finally, the organizational consolidation could rebound favorably by elevating the influence of newly empowered State officials in the interagency process.\nDevelopment aid is not an end in itself, nor can it be successful if pursued independently of other U.S. programs and activities.… To be effective, U.S. development assistance must be coordinated with other diplomatic activities, such as challenging corrupt government practices or persuading governments to adopt more sensible land-use policies. Only a coordinated diplomatic and assistance effort will advance the nation’s goals abroad.\nThe Under Secretary of State for Economic Development should serve as the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The new bureau should encompass USAID; many of the current responsibilities of the current Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs; and primary responsibility (currently led by the Department of the Treasury) for U.S. policy at the World Bank and the regional development banks. If the next Administration decided to make the State Department the lead trade negotiator, it would make sense to move the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative out of the Executive Office of the President and place it under the authority of the Under Secretary of State for Economic Development. Otherwise, the bureau should minimize its activities on economic sanctions, trade policy and export promotion, and production of reports like the Country Commercial Guides, and restrict activities for which the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury have primary responsibility.\nEliminate the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. Most of the functional bureaus and offices overseen by this Under Secretary involve global concerns and matters that are also addressed by various international organizations, such as refugees and trafficking, international law enforcement, and human rights. These issues are important, but the current structure creates an artificial separation from the policy bureaus that can lead to counterproductive disputes or result in disregard through “out of sight, out of mind” behavior. Instead, issues like human rights and counterterrorism should be incorporated into the policy bureaus where they can receive due consideration and be weighed against other priorities to help develop a more robust and well-rounded U.S. policy position. Therefore, most of these responsibilities should be shifted under the new Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs where they can be incorporated and reconciled with similar and related U.S. multilateral policy priorities and objectives. A notable exception is the Bureau of Counterterrorism, which should shift to the Under Secretary for International Security Affairs. While overarching responsibility for issues like human rights and trafficking should shift to the Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs, the bilateral aspects of these activities should not be overlooked, and democracy and human rights country offices should be integrated into the regional bureaus.\nEliminate the position of Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources. There is no need for a second Deputy Secretary to oversee matters that can be, and until 2009 were, handled by the Deputy Secretary, the Executive Secretary, and the Under Secretary for Management.\nMerge complementary offices and bureaus and emphasize their overarching purpose. There has been an unfortunate tendency in recent years to elevate individual aspects of broader policy priorities and give them independent authority. This can create counter-productive firewalls, competition over resources or prioritization among what should be complementary initiatives, and confusion over who ultimately is in charge of policy. Effective policy addressing these matters requires a complementary approach, and those charged with addressing closely related issues should be located in the same office or bureau. For instance, trafficking in persons, a terrible and growing problem, relates closely to and frequently overlaps with refugee and migration concerns, so it makes sense to merge these responsibilities under the same office. Similarly, promoting human rights makes no sense if it is not linked to promoting representative government, so it makes sense to continue this linkage within an updated State Department structure. Likewise, women’s issues, civil rights, labor rights, religious liberty, and most basic human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing. They should be viewed and pursued as part of a comprehensive human rights agenda, not as distinct or discrete efforts, and should be merged into the overarching office for human rigths and democracy promotion. Along those same lines, as seen with Ebola, SARs, HIV/AIDS, and the Zika virus, just to name a few examples, communicable diseases that span global borders pose significant threats. To better address these threats, a reformed Department of State should include an office for international health, which should incorporate existing health-related offices, such as the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, and responsibilities, such as coordinating U.S. international policy to address or respond to transnational health threats in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other mergers and reorganizations should be considered and weighed against the current structure to determine if there are missed opportunities to capitalize on mutually reinforcing and harmonizing policies, programs, and agendas.\nReconsider lines of authority for non-U.N. multilateral organizations. For instance, the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO is placed in the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs. It is worth considering whether this security organization would be better placed with the Under Secretary for International Security Affairs, whose responsibilities would be more explicitly focused on international security threats, including counterterrorism, or even shifted to the Department of Defense with only a State liaison.\nTreat former U.S. territories as the independent nations they have become. Relations with former U.S. territories that are now independent (the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau) continue to primarily be handled through the U.S. Department of the Interior through its Office of Insular Affairs, which coordinates federal policy for those territories and is “responsible for administering and overseeing U.S. federal assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.” These territories are now independent nations and should be treated as such, with U.S. assistance being provided through the Department of State and USAID, rather than through legacy programs in the Department of the Interior.\nFigure 1 presents a revised State Department organization chart illustrating these changes.\nIn a world where information warfare is being conducted by major powers as well as by unconventional enemies of the United States, the U.S. government must have the tools to engage in the ongoing war of ideas. The challenges the United States faces in this sphere are as intense as they were during the Cold War, yet they are more diverse and complex. The United States is not just engaged in one war of ideas with the Communist Soviet Union. The United States must counter—with truth and news—the lies and false promises of a whole range of global actors, who represent threats to the United States, its allies, and the Western way of life.\nFrom Russia, the United States and its allies are bombarded with anti-American and reality-distorting propaganda. From China, more subtle influence operations include a global news network, funding of American universities, and well-produced and widely distributed publications in English. Terrorist groups, especially ISIS, are media savvy and produce slick propaganda aimed at radicalizing Muslims here and throughout the world.\nAbdicating the U.S. role in information warfare would send a huge signal to the world that the United States is assuming an isolationist position. It is not the kind of signal the country can afford to send when the world desperately needs U.S. leadership. Instability, conflict, and political repression in disparate areas of the world underscore the need for America to promote its policies and provide objective news and clear calls for freedom, representative governance, and mutual tolerance.\nReform the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Although the BBG was created to provide a firewall against political influence on its news broadcasting, its structure and lax observance of bylaws and agreed practices invites internal conflict and the creation of fiefdoms by individual governors. Even though it oversees multiple organizations and activities with a budget of close to $750 million, the BBG operates on a part-time basis; the nine members of the board, which include the Secretary of State ex officio, have other jobs, and meet once a month or less, and the absence of day-to-day leadership has impeded effective governance of the various entities overseen by the BBG. If there is to be a broadcasting board, it should reserve itself to overseeing the performance of the Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting, providing independent perspective and medium-term and long-term planning suggestions to the Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting and Congress, and serving as an independent vessel for staff to register complaints or constructive suggestions for improvement.\nMake the new position of Chief Executive Officer for International Broadcasting permanent. Established in 2014, the CEO answers only to the BBG. The position was created to fill the day-to-day leadership gaps created by a part-time BBG. However, the CEO position lacks the permanence and resulting authority that would arise from legislated reform. The CEO, appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress, should replace the leadership role performed by the BBG and be instructed to coordinate with the State Department on U.S. public diplomacy messaging and targeting.\nUnderscore that the mission of USIB is to promote and explain U.S. foreign and national security policy and provide news in areas of the world where there are no alternative free media sources. USIB has on occasion inappropriately downplayed its American message. It should be made clear that the purpose of USIB is not to be a U.S. government-funded CNN or BBC, but to support U.S. interests. When there is no pre-existing free and independent media, this mission encompasses the provision of objective news content. Specifically, USIB should focus on countries where representative government or a free and independent media are absent or inadequate, where there is conflict and political instability, or where U.S. interests justify a robust public diplomacy presence.\nDisaggregate the broadcasting services according to their functions. Voice of America (VOA) should become an explicit arm of U.S. public diplomacy overseen by the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Surrogate USIB media, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, should remain under the authority of the CEO for USIB and the BBG. They should more closely coordinate and share resources in order to increase efficiency and enjoy economies of scale, and should focus on bolstering America’s democracy promotion by providing unbiased news coverage, policy and political discussion, and, where governments constrain political speech, alternative outlets for political dissidents and minority parties. The USIB surrogates could benefit from an affiliation with the National Endowment for Democracy, whose mission they share.\nRegularly re-evaluate capabilities to ensure that foreign language services address enduring, pressing, and evolving needs. Short-sighted decisions have currently left the United States short of assets with which to counter the new Russian revanchism, the aggressive Chinese global media advances, and the ideological threats from militant Islam, to name a few of the critical challenges currently faced by this country.\nWork with Congress to enact a State Department authorization bill. It has been over a decade since a State Department authorization bill has been enacted, and the statutory foundation undergirding the department is showing its age with new offices and bureaus established without express congressional input, staff and budget expanded based on annual appropriations bills, and statutes habitually circumvented through appropriations riders for convenience rather than examined and changed through deliberative debate and process. The next Administration should engage Congress at an early stage to update and adjust the State Department’s authorizing language in order to better equip the department to meet the pressing challenges facing the nation from abroad.\nConsult closely with Congress on the appointment of special envoys, special representatives, special advisers, and other senior appointees. One motive behind the increasing number of special envoys, special representatives, special advisers, and other senior appointees in recent years may be the slow pace of Senate confirmations. Unlike Ambassadors and senior State Department appointees, most special envoys are not subject to Senate confirmation and thus can be put into place more quickly. But the non-confirmable appointees also circumvent congressional oversight and accountability and could, ironically, serve to irritate individual Senators or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and delay or hinder presidential appointees where Senate confirmation is required.\nWhile reasonable in so far as they go, these criteria leave substantial room for interpretation that ill-serves the constitutional process and America’s negotiating partners who cannot be certain of the status, permanence, and legality of an agreement with the U.S. The next Administration should work with Congress to expand factor No. 4 above by examining past practice on how various subjects have been treated historically (treaty, executive agreement, or congressional-executive agreement) and specify the issues or context that should mandate consideration of international agreements as treaties under Article II. The purpose of this examination should be to update and modernize the C-175 procedure in order to restore its original role as an effective mechanism for distinguishing various forms of international commitments.\nReview congressionally mandated reports. Over the years, Congress has enacted legislation requiring the State Department and other agencies to submit dozens of periodic reports on a broad array of issues. Some of these reports have been overtaken by events and, while they address concerns that were at one time of great concern to Congress or the American people, they no longer attract much attention or are largely irrelevant to current policy. Some reporting legislation requires updating to reflect changes over time. Other reports remain highly relevant and critical even though they may only be read or used by a small number of key committees and congressional staff.\nIn some cases, like the important and valuable annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the topics of the reports can increase stress in America’s bilateral relationships and create incentives for State to downplay situations if delicate negotiations or other priorities could be affected. In order to preserve the integrity of the content and protect it from political interference, Congress should consider giving responsibility for producing these reports to an independent, bipartisan U.S. federal government commission, similar to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, to create bureaucratic distance between the report and the State Department.\nOverall, however, the next Administration should engage Congress on a detailed review of existing reporting requirements to: (1) eliminate outdated or irrelevant reports that sap valuable time and resources from the State Department; (2) review and amend the terms of dated reports to make them more useful and germane to current concerns; and (3) retain and prioritize reports of special importance to authorizing or appropriating committees.\nEstablish a dedicated unit for international organizations in the Office of Inspector General for the Department of State. The U.S. remains dependent on the internal U.N. oversight mechanisms, many of which lack independence, have inadequate resources, or face problems with competence, corruption, or bias. The value of having a separate U.S. Inspector General unit that can investigate the activities funded in substantial part by U.S. taxpayers, is illustrated by reports of the U.S. Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) that has identified numerous management and oversight failings of U.N. Development Programme projects in Afghanistan.\nConduct a periodic cost-benefit analysis of U.S. participation in all international organizations. Although a number of U.N. organizations provide important contributions to U.S. diplomatic, economic, and security interests, not all do. The U.S. lacks a comprehensive analysis of whether these contributions are advancing or undermining U.S. interests or being used to maximum effect. An example of what the U.S. should do is the Multilateral Aid Review conducted by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development that assessed the relative value for U.K. aid money disbursed through multilateral organizations. This report identified those U.N. agencies providing poor value for money and led to the decision to zero out funding for four U.N. agencies. The last time the U.S. conducted a similar exercise, albeit in a far less rigorous manner, was under the Clinton Administration in 1995, which led directly to the U.S. decision to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The U.S. should not let two decades lapse before repeating this type of analysis.\nRenew the annual reporting on all federal agency contributions to the U.N. system to be conducted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Most U.S. contributions to the U.N. system come from the State Department, but millions of dollars also flow from other parts of the federal government. Thus, relying on State Department data, such as that in State’s annual report to Congress on U.S. contributions to international organizations, presents an incomplete picture. Because the OMB is in charge of overseeing the preparation of the President’s budget, it is able to require all U.S. agencies to report the requested information. Previous legislation mandated similar reports on U.S. contributions to the U.N. system for fiscal years 2001–2010. That legislative requirement has since lapsed. Thus, the first of these reports should require information for FY 2011 through the most recently completed fiscal year to fill in the reporting gap.\nTo effectively confront the challenges facing America, the next President will need a focused and efficient State Department that is capably led, properly structured, and dedicated to implementing the President’s foreign policy initiatives. Simply increasing resources will not address the widely acknowledged shortcomings of the Department of State. The above recommendations are not comprehensive, but if embraced and implemented, would contribute to ensuring that the President is better served by a more effective and accountable State Department.\n—Brett D.

        "prompt": "On Tuesday, November 4th, voters in Montclair will have the opportunity to join a growing number of New Jersey municipalities that allow private sector workers to earn paid sick days. A local ballot initiative would allow nearly all private sector workers to earn 3-5 days per year to care for themselves or their families when illness strikes. For voters who want to keep Montclair’s families, workplaces and local economy healthy, our top priority can be found at the bottom of the November 4th ballot.\nFor people with paid sick days, it can be easy to take them for granted. But nearly one quarter of adults in the United States have either lost their job or had their job threatened because of a family illness. For the over 40 percent of Montclair workers who lack paid sick days, every cold becomes a crisis and every child’s fever could spell economic catastrophe.\nAllowing workers to earn paid sick days isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do for our community. Workers without sick days go to work sick or send their sick children to school, prolonging illnesses and spreading infectious diseases. During the H1N1 epidemic, 7 million people caught the virus because co-workers came to work sick. Even worse, food service, personal healthcare and childcare workers are the least likely to have paid sick days. It puts us all at risk.\nEvery time a paid sick day law is proposed, some businesses insist the sky will fall. But the dire predictions never materialize. Six in seven San Francisco employers reported no decrease in profitability after its law went into effect. Far from abusing the law, workers used their sick days as intended. The average worker in Connecticut and San Francisco used only half of the days allotted to them. In San Francisco, a quarter of workers used no sick days at all.\nAnd far from losing jobs, San Francisco and Seattle both outpaced their neighbors in job growth since passing paid sick days laws. Jersey City has also gained jobs more quickly than the rest of the state since passing New Jersey’s first paid sick days law in January.\nThat’s because paid sick days laws keep our economy healthy, too. People coming to work sick costs our country $180 billion per year through reduced productivity and increased workplace infection, higher than the cost of absenteeism. Paid sick days reduce employee turnover, one of the biggest costs for business. And, as with minimum wage increases, workers use the additional pay to spend in local businesses, stimulating the economy.\nThis is a win-win for Montclair workers and businesses. We urge voters to vote YES on the municipal public question at the bottom of the ballot for a stronger, healthier Montclair.\nI really don’t care who does it, but would someone at least provide the courtesy of posting the actual ordinance? Since BlueWave is a sponsor and has a website, you would be the logical candidate.\nEmployees are already allowed to earn paid sick days. When I was still working in Montclair, we all earned paid sick days. If that were the goal, this question wouldn’t need to be on the ballot. This proposal is to *require* people to earn paid sick days. Employers don’t get to choose. Employees don’t get to choose.\nIf someone considers himself healthy and prefers to take this benefit’s value as cash, he’ll be forced to work outside of Montclair.\nI think it telling that this post – and the version I’d originally seen in the Montclair Times – uses the word “allow” rather than “require”. It would suggest that the supporters are trying to keep the truth obscured.\nIt is also interesting that this would, if passed, prevent any changes for three years. That suggests that the supporters expect that, after seeing the results, Montclair voters are likely to want to fine-tune or even remove this requirement. Yet we’d be prevented from doing so.\nhttps://baristanetnew.wpengine.com/2014/10/montclair-vote-mandatory-sick-leave-ordinance/#comment-406022 presents an example of the call banks promoting this question providing bad information. A friend reported something similar when she was called, and even my wife received bad information when she was asking questions of the caller.\nWhile a few examples of those could be the result of an overly enthusiastic but ill-informed caller, now we have this letter. This letter repeatedly misstates the result of this proposal, making it seem far more permissive than it actually is.\nThose promoting this proposal seem to be among those questioning it. Even they apparently believe that a fully informed electorate would likely vote against it. The three year period during which it cannot be changed also speaks to this presumption that we’ll ultimately conclude that this is a bad thing for Montclair.\nIf even those proposing and supporting this question think we’d conclude it’s bad for Montclair, then I think the proper choice fairly clear.\nThis is a",

        "prompt": "Insurance companies set premiums based on experience. When they lack experience, as with Obamacare, they make assumptions. One assumption that carriers used in setting 2014 premiums was that a bailout would be available if premiums turn out to be too low. The law establishes “risk corridors” for individual and small group insurance, under which the government will reimburse insurance companies’ losses, up to a point. The risk corridors encourage insurers to quote lower premiums, since they are protected (again, up to a point) by the federal government. But the risk corridor provisions of the act expire in 2016.\nEven more fundamental is the composition of the risk pool in the Obamacare exchanges. The economics of Obamacare, and therefore the premiums charged by insurers, depend entirely on how healthy or sick the people who enroll in Obamacare turn out to be. The Obama administration made projections on this subject, as did the insurers. I don’t think there is any doubt about the fact that actual enrollments in the exchanges have been disappointing from this standpoint. There are nowhere near as many young, healthy people signing up as will be required to make the system work. This is why the Obama administration has embarrassed itself in trying to recruit young people into the program, with Pajama Boy, Obama’s pathetic “Between Two Ferns” interview, Angry Mom, and so on. What this means is that once the insurance companies are able to set premiums based on actual experience, as opposed to rosy projections, those premiums inevitably will rise due to the risk pool being lower-quality than predicted.\nHealth industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration",

        "prompt": "Shopping for a new Volkswagen Tiguan?\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan’s optional third-row seat takes up cargo space and is best for kids.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan has a spacious interior and a comfortable ride, but its price climbs quickly.\nAmong crossover SUVs, the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan stands out for its spacious interior—so long as every seat isn’t filled in seven-seat versions.\nThe VW Tiguan aces real-world utility with its excellent outward vision, comfortable interior, available active safety gear, and good infotainment system. It’s less thrifty than some rivals and its third row—well, the dog will like it.\nAfter an extensive redesign last year, the Tiguan is unchanged for 2019.\nAvailable in S, SE, and SEL trim levels, the Tiguan comes standard with front-wheel drive and offers all-wheel drive as an option. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 184 horsepower is paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Tiguan rides softly, with good composure thanks in part to its 109.8-inch wheelbase. Its steering is quick and light, and it has a confident feel on a curvy road.\nAt 24 mpg combined with all-wheel drive, the Tiguan lags competitors such as the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, which come closer to 30 mpg combined.\nThose rivals don’t offer three rows of seats, although we don’t consider the third row that’s standard on front-drive Tiguans and optional with all-wheel drive to be a major asset. The Tiguan’s front seats are firm and supportive, while row two boasts excellent ingress and egress and a bench that slides forward for more leg room or cargo space. That third row, though. It robs valuable cargo room.\nMost Tiguans have standard active safety hardware such as automatic emergency braking, and the IIHS has given it a Top Safety Pick award, but the NHTSA hasn't rated the compact crossover yet.\nAt about $29,000 with all-wheel drive, the Tiguan SE is a lot of crossover for the money. The range-topping Tiguan SEL Premium trim level loads on niceties such as a digital instrument cluster, a panoramic moonroof, adaptive cruise control, and leather upholstery, but it costs nearly $40,000.\nAll Tiguans include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.\nThe 2019 Tiguan is not related to the Tiguan Limited, an older design that VW discontinued after the 2018 model year but may still be in dealer inventories.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan is an exercise in styling restraint.\nThe 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan’s styling is forgettable—unless it’s painted in bright orange. It may not be the boldest compact crossover SUV, but the 2019 Tiguan has clean, simple lines that will age well.\nThe 2019 Tiguan stretches about 185 inches from bumper to bumper, making it among the largest compact crossover SUVs. Up front, its grille is wide but not tall, and it’s flanked by halogen headlights on most trims. The Tiguan SEL Premium is the only trim with LED headlights.\nFrom the side, the Tiguan’s long, nearly 110-inch wheelbase gives it big doors for easy ingress and egress. The long rear door doesn’t do much for its looks, however. The Tiguan’s tail end is simple and pert, with LED taillights on all trims parked high on the rear fenders and tailgate.\nStandard 17-inch wheels on the Tiguan S look small in the crossover’s wheel wells. The 18- and 20-inch wheels available on SE and SEL trims fill things out better.\nThe optional R-Line appearance package is costly, about $1,500, and it doesn’t add any functionality.\nInside, the Tiguan has a low, car-like dashboard that follows the same simple design theme as its exterior. A 6.5-inch touchscreen for infotainment takes up residence below climate vents and above controls for heating, air conditioning, and some secondary functions. VW offers a wide selection of interior hues, such as coal bin black or two-tone black and orange.\nThe 2019 VW Tiguan has little power to spare, but its suspension provides a luxurious ride.\nThe turbo-4 is rated at 184 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque and it shuttles power to either the front or all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic. The 2019 Tiguan’s engine builds power quickly, but its transmission can fire off clunky shifts around town and despite the number of cogs it’s not eager about downshifting for highway passing.\nWe’ve noticed a gruff, unrefined feel to the engine at low speeds away from a stop, too.\nWhat we do like is the Tiguan’s comfortable ride. It takes undulating pavement in stride, even with the optional 20-inch wheels with their narrow sidewalls.\nThe Tiguan’s flat-bottom three-spoke steering wheel could have been plucked from a VW GTI, but steering feel is limited. The Tiguan handles with poise and confidence, although it’s light on entertainment even in the sport mode that adds heft but not road communication.\nAt highway speeds, the Tiguan boasts excellent straight-line stability and limited wind and road roar.\nThe optional all-wheel-drive system provides surefooted traction on dirt roads and in snowy conditions. With 7.9 inches of ground clearance and long overhangs, the Tiguan is less suited to rocky trails to campsites than a few of its rivals, however.\nPlenty of space for everyone can be found in the 2019 VW Tiguan, as long as they’re not in the optional third row.\nThe 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan splits the difference between compact and mid-size crossover SUVs, meaning it’s more spacious than a Honda CR-V but not as big inside as a Toyota Highlander.\nThe VW Tiguan’s front seats are firm and supportive, with good adjustment and lumbar support. The standard cloth upholstery on the Tiguan S has a grippy, tough feel, although the synthetic leather fitted to SE and SEL trims is durable and easy to clean. The Tiguan SEL Premium drapes its interior in leather—as it should for nearly $39,000.\nAccess to the second row is via one of the biggest door openings this side of a Boeing 737. Once aboard, passengers in coach class will find leg room more akin to Main Cabin Extra or Economy Plus when the three-seat bench is slid all the way back. The bench slides forward to expand cargo capacity to 48.6 cubic feet on five-seat Tiguans. The optional third row seat—mandatory with front-wheel drive—robs about 2.5 cubic feet.\nThe Tiguan’s third row is difficult to access and not suitable for adults. Kids who can fit back there are probably small enough that they should be in booster seats, which robs more utility.\nOur advice? If you need a third row VW, look across the showroom at the larger Atlas.\nThe Tiguan has decent interior materials for what it costs. Soft-touch, low-sheen surfaces drape its front doors and dashboard. As is typical for compact crossover SUVs, rear-seat riders get stuck with hard plastics. At least there are two small vents to cool or warm those passengers.\nSurprisingly, the 2019 VW Tiguan has not been fully crash tested by the NHTSA.\nWhat crash tests have been performed on the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan have yielded good results, but we’re still waiting on the feds to run one into a wall.\nAll but the base Tiguan S come standard with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and blind-spot monitors. Those features cost about $850 on the S trim—money well spent.\nThe Tiguan SEL adds adaptive cruise control, while the SEL Premium includes active lane control, automatic high-beam headlights, and parking sensors.\nThe NHTSA performed side-impact crash tests on the 2019 Tiguan. It earned five stars, but the feds noted that the driver’s door unlatched and opened during their test. The feds have not performed frontal crash tests on the 2019 Tiguan.\nThe base 2019 VW Tiguan is a good value, but loaded models are surprisingly expensive.\nAt about $28,000 with all-wheel drive and a $850 option package that includes active safety tech, the 2019 Tiguan S is a good value. It includes a 6.5-inch touchscreen for infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bluetooth, and cruise control. It’s hardly lavish, but it’s not lacking much.\nThe Tiguan SE costs about $29,000, and it’s the one we’d buy. For that extra $1,000, buyers get an 8.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment, standard active tech, keyless ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, and synthetic leather upholstery.\nThe costliest Tiguan is the SEL Premium. With its leather seats, power liftgate, active lane control, parking sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and Fender audio system, it’s equipped—and priced—like a luxury crossover. With all-wheel drive and a $1,500 R-Line appearance package, the Tiguan SEL Premium costs about $40,000.\nAll Tiguans include a 6-year, 72,000-mile warranty that’s transferable to subsequent owners.\n",

He spent the next five years of his life working on the book and it was finally published in 2016.\nHis book, The Paradox of Animal Sociality: The Evolutionary Theory for the 21st Century, is the culmination of years of research.

One minute you are being recognised by higher powers for being in the form of your life, the next you come back down to earth with a season-ending injury.\nUnfortunately for Peterborough United midfielder Jermaine Anderson, that is exactly what has happened to him.\nThe 19-year-old was named Football League Young Player of the Month for November, a month in which he scored four goals in four games.\nBut just three minutes into the FA Cup visit of Luton on 6 December, he suffered a knee injury which will keep him out for the rest of the campaign.\nAnderson told BBC Sport: \"It's difficult, but it's football. Football loves to spring surprises on you and it's just how you deal with it which sums you up.\n\"It's a shame for it to happen but I'll be working hard with the physio, doing my rehab and hopefully coming back better, fitter, stronger and I'll see if I can improve on other areas of the pitch.\"\nPeterborough United have become the first club to have three winners of the Football League Young Player of the Month award - Anderson, Britt Assombalonga and Marcus Maddison.\nIt is not the first time in his short career that the London-born midfielder has had a long-term lay-off, having missed the end of last season after breaking his foot.\nBut, almost certainly speaking from experience, Anderson is philosophical about his road to recovery.\n\"It's not an injury you can't come back from, loads of people come back from it all the time,\" he said.\n\"It's just whether or not I want to put in the work or not, which obviously I will do to get back to how I was playing.\n\"I think with the people that I have around me, the physios and the management staff, they won't allow me not to come back to how I used to be. It won't be easy, but I will come back to how I was.\"\nBefore his injury, Anderson was a key member of Posh's midfield diamond, a system that has given the Cambridgeshire club new life since manager Graham Westley took over at the ABAX Stadium in September.\nUnder the former Stevenage boss, Posh have climbed from 18th in League One to a play-off place, with Anderson's goalscoring run more than the rest of his career combined.\n\"The gaffer telling me I need to score more goals and affect the game going forward,\" replied Anderson.\n\"In training I was working on late runs into the box, doing more work on finishing in and outside the box and knowing when to go for headers and crosses because our full-backs get up high and get good balls into the box.\n\"I think he's made me a more attacking player because I was doing well defensively but I wasn't getting many assists or goals. That's something him and Grant McCann noticed straight away - to make me an all-round midfielder.\"\nHis form sees him follow in the footsteps of his close friend, Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli, who won the award in August 2014.\nThe pair know each other from international youth teams and playing against one another in development squads.\nAsked if they would speak",

        "prompt": "The biggest news item from Subaru this year was the introduction of the long-awaited Subaru Ascent. Resting atop the new Subaru global platform currently used by Crosstrek and Impreza, the new Ascent will be the first large vehicle to use the new architecture.\nAt first glance, there’s immediate Subaru signature design cues in both the exterior grille and interior treatments. The biggest thing about the Ascent is it sheer size – it feels odd to see such a large Subaru body. But it is attractive, reflecting subtle sophistication with a capable athletic stance.\nAs dedicated as the Subaru loyal seem to be to the booming all-wheel-drive brand, even their enthusiasm waned when it came to the Tribeca, the biggest Subaru of the day, which went away in 2014.\nWhile providing a step-up vehicle for growing families who started with Outbacks and Foresters, the Tribeca SUV never had the sales impact the brand needed from it. Built in Lafayette, IN, the Ascent is exclusive to the North American market, as it offers Subaru’s notable reliability, legendary endurance, eight-passenger capacity, and all-wheel-drive surefootedness.\nThe big news distinction regarding the Ascent is the potential three-row eight-passenger capacity. Entry and exit from row three, which can be challenging for any SUV design, is notable for its big space, providing simple access via a sliding row two and grab handles for extra ease.\nAccording to Subaru, the grab handles on the row-two seats were inspired by Japan’s famously well-thought-out bullet train interior designs.\nBoth the Premium and Limited trim levels will offer a choice of cabin configuration for rows two and three. At no additional expense, Ascent owners may pick from a traditional second row bench or captain’s chairs (one provides 7-passenger seating, the other 8).\nAside from the obvious Impreza performance exceptions, Subaru does not necessarily hang its hat on high-speed performance being a requirement for its vehicles. A new 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four engine will be paired to a CVT transmission.

        "prompt": "Two military veterans and political novices, tapping into broad discontent with Congress and President Donald Trump, have emerged as formidable Democratic challengers to entrenched Central Texas Republican congressmen — at least when it comes to raising money.\nThe surprising fundraising numbers don’t signal tight races necessarily, but more than a year before the general election, Democratic candidates in Republican-held districts in Austin and beyond are converting liberal outrage in the age of Trump into cash.\n\"Trump’s lower than average net approval ratings for a Republican in Texas, as well as anger and dismay within the activist ranks of the Democratic Party, has resulted in more than 50 Democratic candidates launching bids to flip the state’s 25 Republican held seats in 2018,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.\nJoseph Kopser, an Austin tech executive and 20-year Army veteran who was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq, reported raising $213,000 during the three months ending Sept. 30 — $14,000 more than incumbent U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, raised during that period.\nBut Smith, who was first elected to Congress in 1986, has almost $1 million cash on hand while Kopser has a little over $219,000. The 21st District, which includes staunchly liberal pockets west and south of downtown Austin, encompasses conservative Hill Country counties, and was drawn to elect a Republican. Still, Kopser and two other Democratic challengers are counting on Smith’s climate change skepticism as chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee to draw Democrats and independents to the polls next year.\n\"Lamar Smith needs to be paying close attention,\" said Calvin Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political science professor. \"His district is evolving, and he has some issue positions especially on global warming he’s going to have to defend.\"\n\"There is an energy on the Democratic side that is showing in a larger number of candidates,\" said Jillson, who added that Texas being a red state made it \"very difficult\" to defeat Republican incumbents.\nKopser, at least, is playing to that energy.\n\"It’s becoming apparent that Smith is so out of touch he doesn’t even realize how fired up his district is today,\" said Kopser, who co-founded a clean energy transportation company and is being supported by a pro-science group, 314 Action. Other Democratic candidates challenging Smith: Derrick Crowe, an Austin organizer and former congressional staffer, who raised $25,000, and Elliott McFadden, CEO of the nonprofit Austin B-cycle, who raised $16,000.\nSmith, who was re-elected last fall with 57 percent of the vote, didn’t return a request for comment.\nIn Round Rock, Mary Jennings Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot, reported raising $93,000 July 1-Sept. 30, in her bid to run against U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, who raised $113,000 during the same period. Carter, a former state district judge who was first elected to Congress in 2002, has $437,000 in his campaign coffers, compared with just $54,000 for Hegar.\nThe district, which includes a large part of Fort Hood, skews Republican, but in several Round Rock and Cedar Park precincts, Democrat Hillary Clinton outpolled Trump last November.\n\"I’m really pleased we out-raised him by about $10,000 in individual contributions,\" said Hegar, attributing Carter’s fundraising edge to corporate and PAC contributions. \"We have the grass roots on the ground.\"\nHegar is the author of the bestselling book, \"Shoot Like a Girl: One Woman’s Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front,\" which is being made into a movie starring Angelina Jolie. Hegar was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.\nShe was also a lead plaintiff in a 2012 lawsuit that challenged the Pentagon’s prohibition against women in combat, which was later repealed.\nAlso running for the Democratic nomination in Congressional District 31: Kent Lester, a 20-year Army veteran and former high school teacher in Belton, who raised $33,000 over the last three months.\nCarter also has a GOP opponent, Georgetown businessman Mike Sweeney, who raised nearly $7,800. He also challenged Carter in 2016, losing in the primary.\nCarter, who was re-elected last fall with 58 percent of the vote, said in a statement to the American-Statesman, \"As I visit with my neighbors around District 31, I’m confident in their support for my re-election.\"\nU.S. Rep.

Michael McCaul, R-Austin, hasn’t drawn an opponent reporting contributions to the Federal Election Commission. McCaul raised $221,000 but has only $218,000 cash on hand, an indicator that he was weighing an exit from electoral politics. Last month McCaul was passed over to be secretary of homeland security — for the second time — and the Trump administration recently announced the nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen, a top aide to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, to the post.\n\"They went in a different direction — to a career official instead of a politician,\" McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the Statesman. \"I think they valued my leadership in the House. I think that was part of the calculation.\"\nMcCaul on Wednesday announced his re-election campaign co-chairs, who include Lt. Gov.

        "prompt": "Bill Gausman (right), senior vice president of asset management, and other Pepco officials prepare to testify Tuesday morning in Baltimore during a Maryland Public Service Commission hearing on Pepco's response to recent storm-related power outages.\nPepco's record on service interruptions to its customers has been below the median for utilities nationwide for several years, its executive said under questioning from the Maryland Public Service Commission on Tuesday.\nAnd for the past two years, Pepco has been in the bottom 50 percent or 25 percent of that performance measure, said Bill Gausman, Pepco's senior vice president for asset management and planning.\n\"We strive to move toward the first or second quartile,\" he said.\nPepco officials spoke at a public hearing Tuesday called by the PSC after state and local officials requested for an investigation following the latest series of power outages during summer storms. A number of Montgomery County officials attended the hearing in Baltimore, including eight of the nine County Council members. Councilman Michael J. Knapp (D-Dist. 2) of Germantown did not attend because he away on a family vacation.\nHundreds of thousands of Pepco customers in Montgomery and Prince George's counties lost power for up to five days during the two February snowstorms and three severe summer storms since July 25.\nDuring the hearing, Gausman said Pepco is closer to the industry average on the duration of its outages.\nCommission Chairman Douglas R.M. Nazarian asked, \"When would you expect to get above average performance?\"\n\"I would like to say it's probably a four-year program,\" Gausman replied.\n\"Why is it acceptable to have acceptable performance in four years?\" Nazarian responded.\nPepco is prepared to accelerate some improvements, David Velazquez, executive vice president of power delivery, told the five commissioners.\nA recently approved rate hike will help pay for those, including more aggressive tree trimming to curb falling trees and limbs that Pepco says causes most of its outages.\nBut getting property owners to allow them to trim as far as they must to clear the lines and not endanger the tree, as state foresters require, can be difficult, Pepco executives said.\nIn March, Pepco told the PSC it would take about 10 years to catch up on its four-year tree trimming maintenance program.\nOn Tuesday, officials said the rate increase would help, but they still would not catch up for several years.\nMeanwhile, the utility is spending more to increase efficiency on its worst-performing power feeders, including burying some lines underground, and has gotten a 50 to 60 percent improvement in their performance, Gausman said.\nBut a review by The Gazette of the utility's own reports to the PSC show as many as 1 percent of the utility's feeders have outage frequency or outage duration measures that are at least five times Pepco's own subpar system average.\nAccording to reports filed with the PSC, a key reliability measurement, the System Average Interruption Frequency Index, was about 61 percent higher for Pepco in 2009 than for Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. and more than 100 percent higher than for Allegheny Power in Maryland.\nThat index, which measures the average number of outages per customer, was 2.06 for Pepco in Maryland, 1.28 for BGE and less than 1 for Allegheny.\nIn 2008, the index, known as SAIFI, was 2.85, or 2.26 per customer for Pepco depending on whether major event outages were included.\nFor BGE, the index was 1.83 or 1.68, and for Allegheny, it was 1.33 or 1.16.\nWhile there is no national or Maryland SAIFI standard, a U.S. Department of Energy-funded study published in 2008 by Earnest Orlando Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory found an average SAIFI of 1.54 or 1.31 in 2006 for electric utilities in the United States that reported data.\nThe same study found SAIFI averages of 1.94 or 1.5 for utilities in the South Atlantic region, which includes Maryland, and 1.54 or 1.13 for the mid-Atlantic region to the north.\nRegarding the recent storms, Mike Sullivan, Pepco's senior vice president of operations, said, \"We are not terribly disappointed in our response,\" although perhaps Pepco could have added more crew leaders and assessment staff earlier.\nPepco region President Thomas Graham said the utility could have worked with local governments earlier to take advantage of the services they offered.\nBut Graham and Sullivan said they were not sure they could have brought in much more help without those assisting getting in each other's way.\n\"We had all the crews we could handle,\" Sullivan said.\n\"There's a bigger issue here than just storm events,\" Commissioner Susanne Brogan said, pointing to the utility's high outage rate in normal conditions.\nPepco has admitted failures in informing the public and estimating when their power would be restored.",

Feldman (D-Dist. 15) of Potomac said Monday that he will offer legislation, drafted with the help of Montgomery County Councilman Roger Berliner (D-Dist. 1) of Potomac, that would require the PSC to establish reliability standards by 2012 and would reduce utilities' profits incrementally for failing to meet those standards.\nThe PSC requires electric utilities to report outage data, including the average number and duration of outages per customer, but does not set standards or prescribe penalties.\nPepco is poised to accelerate its efforts, but \"what is the standard to be?\" Berliner said during a break in the hearing Tuesday. \"I think they need to aim higher, and we need to hold them to a higher standard.\"\nA public hearing in Rockville will be held at the end of the month for county residents to air their complaints to the PSC.

The Echo line of smart speakers continues to enjoy the largest market share, and Windows 10 is installed on nearly 700 million computers.\nThe partnership was made in recognition of the fact that we live in a multi-assistant world.\n“The world is big and so multifaceted. There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement when the partnership was announced last August.\nThe idea makes sense. I’m ready for a world in which assistants feel more like apps you access on a platform rather than standalone operating systems.\nI’d like to have to have an assistant dedicated to fitness, like the kind Google is reportedly working on, or one to help with cooking or meetings, maybe even one for dating or matters of personal growth.\nPersonally, I’d rather have assistants informed by mountains of data within an area of expertise than one with a range of moderately developed features that tells jokes.\nThe multi-assistant world is a narrative that works for Amazon and Microsoft and startups who want to enter the AI assistant space, but that point of view may be about more than the evolution of AI assistants. Their assistants need to live in a multi-assistant world, whereas Google Assistant and Siri arguably do not.\nGoogle and Apple‘s assistants don’t need to branch out because they enjoy a monopoly where it matters most: in your pocket.\nSmart speakers are growing at a rapid rate, with global sales up 187 percent in Q2 2018, but the smartphone is still far and away the device people are most likely to use when speaking with an assistant. This has been shown to be true in survey after survey after survey.\nUnlike Microsoft and Amazon, Apple and Google have the option of tethering multimodal experiences to speakers and iOS or Android mobile operating systems.\nThat’s not to say companies like Microsoft and Amazon don’t stand a chance. As smartphone sales go flat, smart speaker sales are expected to grow sixfold in the years ahead. In fact, smart speakers represent an opportunity to disrupt the dominance of smartphones and change consumer behavior on a massive scale.\nAn Accenture survey of 21,000 consumers around the world found that the majority of smart speaker owners are less likely to use their smartphones for tasks like entertainment, purchasing, and general searches while at home.\nGoogle has maintained its lead over Amazon in global smart speaker sales for the second quarter in a row, but it’s been suggested that Google should give away Home Minis for free because Amazon’s presence in millions of homes with Echo speakers could eat into Google’s search and shopping revenue.\nEven being the native assistant on a smartphone doesn’t guarantee victory in the fierce competition for consumer loyalty. The assistant still has to, as Cortana product lead Javier Soltero put it, win the Pepsi taste test challenge for users.\nExclusive features that take advantage of each companies‘ unique attributes could lead to people preferring Google Assistant because Duplex is so good at automating appointment scheduling or favoring Cortana because its natural language understanding has been advanced by the work of Microsoft’s new conversational AI center at UC Berkeley. Could you imagine if Cortana got incredibly smart about LinkedIn and GitHub insights? That would be powerful and is something only Microsoft can do.\nBut barring some sort of extraordinary developments, assistants in smartphones still enjoy a key advantage.\nWe’ll find out in time if people actually use Cortana on Echo speakers or Alexa on Windows 10 PCs, or whether doing so changes expectations about how assistants should function. But no matter how this experiment is received, the smartphone is still the primary place people interact with an AI assistant, and not even a collaboration between two of the biggest tech companies on the planet can change that — at least for now.\nP.",

In the case of President Trump, the emotional distance seems to have been shattered by simple, indelible images of suffering children in Idlib, Syria.\n“When you kill innocent children, innocent babies — babies! — little babies … that crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines,” Trump said Wednesday, his voice high and stretched, after pictures surfaced of lifeless infants choked to death by poison gas.\nWith that conviction, Trump took military action Thursday night, ordering retaliatory missile attacks on a Syrian air base. American interventionism is our best and worst national trait. Historically, until 1941, the United States was a reluctant warrior, fearful of foreign entanglement. Thursday marked the 100th anniversary of America’s entry into World War I, a conflict that still drips with senseless, dutiful killing. The young men of Europe had been slaughtering each other since 1914, but on the other side of the Atlantic it was “America First” until Congress backed Woodrow Wilson and declared war on April 6, 1917.\nTrump’s wariness on Syria had been like President Barack Obama’s: He said repeatedly, over the past six years and during the campaign, that he opposed more headlong U.S. military actions in quests that might be morally urgent but strategically fuzzy. Republican hawks such as Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) had blasted Obama’s reluctance to intervene, but not Trump. Back in 2013, he’d argued against calls to bomb Syria in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons.\nGiven that Trump’s view of Syria was so similar to Obama’s, his attempt to blame the latest chemical attack there on his predecessor’s alleged weakness was especially dubious. It displayed his embattled, defensive self-image: He is a victim of someone else’s bad decisions.Why did Assad use nerve gas in Idlib? It’s impossible to know. Maybe it was a signal to an increasingly aggressive Israel that he still had chemical weapons, or maybe it was a warning to Russia that he wasn’t a pawn to be traded in a grand bargain with Trump. But most likely, it was a reaction to the free hand he was seemingly given when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a few days earlier during a visit to Turkey that Assad’s future “will be decided by the Syrian people”",

The irony is that Trump faces the same bad military options for pressing the attack in western Syria beyond this initial strike that Obama did. U.S. military commanders have focused on the battle against the Islamic State in eastern Syria. The Pentagon has a plan for a relatively rapid conquest of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the caliphate of the Islamic State, with a force led by Syrian Kurdish fighters. U.S. troops will augment this assault with heavy artillery, Apache helicopter gunships and forward-deployed advisers. It’s a pragmatic plan for ending the Islamic State terrorist threat quickly, even at the risk of offending Turkey and leaving Assad and the political muddle in Damascus. This plan had all the pieces except a final White House stamp of approval.",

Just as Trump was about to meet with Xi, he was forced to confront the question of whether he would stand up to a dictator who uses chemical weapons against his own people. It was a test of his resolve, and he passed it.\nBut the question remains: What is the endgame?

But she has little recollection of a critical four-day period when: she was diagnosed; her organs began failing and her kidneys started shutting down; she lost the ability to move her left leg and arm; life-saving treatment commenced; and her condition improved significantly.\nShe’s continued with the plasma exchange every day since.\nBut her brush with death has changed her perspective, she said. These days she wants to live life to the fullest.\nIt took only a few days of treatment before Freeman’s condition went back to almost normal, said kidney specialist Dr. Amit Bagga.\nIf all goes as planned, he expects to stop the daily two-and-a-half-hour plasma exchanges next week.\nShe was diagnosed — by internal medicine chief Dr. Wassim Saad and a crew of medical residents and students — with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disorder involving both clotting and bleeding that’s so rare the staff in Windsor see it once every several years. Without therapy it’s 95 per cent fatal, and even if you survive you’re likely to suffer from permanent brain damage or kidney failure.\nIt’s caused by a lack of activity in a particular blood protein called the ADAMTS13 enzyme, and it leads to extensive blood clots in the small blood vessels, especially in the brain and kidney, said Bagga. It can also lead to low platelets — clotting cells — which can paradoxically lead to serious bleeding. The results of a full-blown case of the disorder are stroke, kidney failure, fever, and low counts of platelets and red blood cells.\nFreeman’s hemoglobin (red blood) count was 54, when normally it should be 120. And her platelet count was six, when a normal reading is 200 to 300.\nPlasma exchange uses a machine to take blood from a vein heading into the heart. (A special catheter near the heart was installed by interventional radiologist Dr. Jack Speirs and his team.)

        "prompt": "\"Pennsylvania (is) the only state in the country not to tax drillers.\"\nBy Colin Deppen on Friday, March 30th, 2018 at 10:13 a.m.\nThe ad includes an animated clip showing black limousines labeled \"LOBBYI$T\" pulling up to the Capitol where bank bags of cash are tossed atop the steps.\nIn the same breath, Wolf says this lobbying blitz has left Pennsylvania \"the only state in the country not to tax drillers.\"\nWhile Pennsylvania remains the largest natural gas-producing state without a severance tax, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is not the \"only state\" without one. A handful of states with relatively low levels of natural gas production or no natural gas production, like Iowa, lack such a measure.\nIn 2012, Wolf’s predecessor, Gov. Tom Corbett, signed into law an updated version of Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act. It included the imposition of a so-called impact fee assessed on new wells, with the resulting revenue distributed to local and state governments to help municipalities \"offset impacts associated with natural gas drilling.\"\nIn June 2017, the Pennsylvania Utility Commission said it had collected and distributed \"more than $1.2 billion in impact fees to communities across Pennsylvania\" over six years.\nReached by email, Erica Wright, vice president of communications and membership with the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade association and lobbying group, pointed back to a previously released statement. It reads, in part, \"since 2012, Pennsylvania’s natural gas impact tax has generated $1.5 billion (and counting) in new revenue. These revenues, which total approximately $200 million annually, directly support communities in every county, as well as key statewide environmental and conservation programs.\"\nThe Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, another industry advocate, also argues that gas drillers pay \"the same taxes as other businesses, PLUS the impact ‘fee’ that NO OTHER businesses pay.\"\nThe point of the ad, Sheridan added by email, is that \"Governor Wolf has taken on lobbyists and special interests to fight for a commonsense severance tax to stop letting oil and gas companies off the hook so they pay their fair share in Pennsylvania.\"\nSheridan continued, \"It’s long past time — Pennsylvania is the only major gas producing state that does not impose a severance tax on oil and gas. States like Texas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma all charge a severance tax, and their natural gas industries continue to thrive.\"\nFor starters, the verbiage — one is a \"fee\" and one is a \"tax.\"\nAccording to StateImpact.org: \"Impact fees are levied on a per-well basis, so each time drillers punch a hole in the ground, they pay. A ‘severance tax’ is applied when resources are severed from the earth, so it would be a tax on the amount of gas produced.\"\nThe Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania said in a 2015 report that the yield for the state would be larger with a severance tax, adding, \"were the severance tax in place for the most recent year, extraction companies would have paid an effective tax rate more than three times the rate they were charged under the impact fee.\"\nIn September, the Pennsylvania State House Energy and Environmental Resources Committee approved an amendment rebranding the existing \"impact fee\" as a \"severance tax.\" Critics called it an act of \"legislative deception\" and an exercise in semantics. Supporters called it an overdue",
        "baseline": " clarification.\nThe conservative Commonwealth Foundation, meanwhile, added that because impact fee revenue was restricted to certain uses under Act 13, and because the fee is a flat rate per unconventional well, these limits make the proposal \"truly a fee, rather than a tax in disguise.\"\nWolf is accurate in saying Pennsylvania does not have a severance tax on drilling. He's also accurate in saying lobbyists are a large part of the reason for that. He's wrong in implying those same lobbyists spent $60 million in direct opposition to severance tax proposals. He's wrong about Pennsylvania being the only state without a severance tax, though it's the only \"major gas-producing state\" without one. It's also misleading to imply that nothing has been done to tap drilling activity for municipal or state gain in Pennsylvania.\nThe result of all this is a lack of context being passed on to viewers and voters.\nPublished: Friday, March 30th, 2018 at 10:13 a.m.",

They all knew that Jerry Sandusky was a snake in the grass, a sexual predator of little boys, and all four of them, Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz, Tim Curley and Joe Paterno, closed their eyes, looked the other way and let this horror run unabated for over a decade.\nAnd for that, Penn State University should suffer.\nThe football program should be drawn and quartered. Hung out to dry for the entire world to see. For once, the NCAA should throw down the gauntlet and make the Nittany Lions pay, and pay big, for what they did not do -- and that was protect the 10 boys that Sandusky was convicted of sexually brutalizing, going as far back as 1998. The school then refused to act when accusations of the crimes were initially brought to light.\nThey all lied. And then they all denied.\nThat's why Penn State football has got to be made an example of. The NCAA should conclude that the university committed the worst act of \"lack of institutional control\" imaginable.\nHow can a university not be punished for not acting when one of its assistant football coaches commits the most heinous of crimes? How can a university not be punished when the head football coach knew of these crimes and didn't act to stop them? How can a university not be punished when the highest of officials not only lied about, but also concealed important facts related to the case?\nWhile jail time is likely forthcoming for Curley and Schultz -- both are awaiting trial for failing to report abuse and lying to a grand jury -- and Spanier was fired, that's not enough. It's time for action. Swift, harsh action. Like cutting scholarships. By a third. Whatever the number is, 100, 90, 80 ¦ slice that by 25 or 30 percent and then take that money and donate it to a foundation designed to protect sexually abused children.\nAnother thing, make the Nittany Lions ineligible for bowl games, all bowl games. How about a 10-year ban? No Big Ten playoffs. No postseason bowl. Nothing. Maybe that might help to offset the decade-plus of terror that Sandusky pulled on these young boys.\nBut it probably won't. Nothing will ever make that nightmare go away.\n\"Our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State,\" wrote Louis Freeh, the former FBI director, who was hired by the university to investigate the Sandusky case. \"The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps to protect the children who Sandusky victimized.\"\nThe report, 276 pages long, paints a graphic picture of a university so focused with keeping its reputation intact that there was a massive \"failure of governance,\" according to the report, on the part of university officials and the Penn State board of trustees.\n\"Taking into account the available witness statements and evidence,\" the report said, \"it is more reasonable to conclude that, in order to avoid the consequences of bad publicity, the most powerful leaders at Penn State University repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's child abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"\nOver an eight-month period, Freeh spoke with over 400 current and former Penn State employees, including hundreds associated with the football program. Among the 3.5 million pieces of evidence Freeh went through, he found handwritten notes from Paterno that said not only did he know of Sandusky's behavior but that he was intimately involved with the administration's decision not to tell Pennsylvania child welfare authorities about a 2001 incident when assistant coach Mike McQueary reported to Paterno that he saw Sandusky naked in a shower with a young boy.\nOne of the most chilling paragraphs in the report comes almost at the beginning when Freeh writes: \"The most saddening finding by the Special Investigative Counsel is the total and consistent disregard by the most senior leaders at Penn State for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims. �",

Rot, mildew and warped wood are just some of the brutalizing effects of wet weather, forcing home owners to repaint or replace siding on an all-too-regular basis.\nBut a growing number of builders are looking to curb the effects of harsh weather with rain screens. Essentially, a rain screen gives up on the notion that a home’s exterior should be watertight, and instead opens up a space between the wall and cladding in order to prevent moisture from getting trapped.\n“A rain screen is trying to create a space between the structural sheeting of the wall and the backside of the siding or finish that is applied to the home in order to allow penetrating water to drain out the bottom,” said Hans Porschitz, head of project management for Bensonwood Homes, a New Hampshire-based homebuilding company that advocates the use of rain screens.\nWhile all rain screen systems employ a space to promote drainage, the actual construction can vary slightly. A builder might use a plastic or glass mesh in the space to offer insulation, while still allowing water to escape.\nNot only can rain screens cut down on exterior rot, they can also improve air quality by eliminating the growth of mold and mildew in the home, a huge benefit for those that suffer from allergies.\nSince a rain screen requires putting extra space between the exterior wall and siding, it is often not possible to add to an existing home. Not only would the existing siding have to be torn off, but the added space would cause the home to have recessed windows and doorways.\n“Retroactively to incorporate it is very expensive because you can’t really slide something in between the siding and the sheeting after,” Porschitz said.\nFortunately, rain screens are becoming a",

In fact, the building method has been around since the days of masonry style houses. But as more companies offer rain screen products and the concept gets an increasing amount of attention in building science literature, home builders are starting to rediscover this old method to protect a home from the elements.\nWhile a rain screen does add to the cost of a new construction, the cost is mainly in materials, usually less than a dollar per square foot.

The use of rain screens in commercial buildings is still in its infancy, but is quickly gaining momentum.\n“Rain screens are becoming more and more common as an alternative to traditional cladding in commercial buildings,” said John Tothill, a senior associate with the architectural firm Perkins+Will. “I think it’s because of the durability and the maintenance benefits.”\nTothill said that while the use of rain screens in commercial buildings",

McDuffie is the team’s most versatile player, especially when he is focused and under control on offense.\nI’d put the juniors in the next group — Shaq Morris, Zach Brown, Rauno Nurger and Rashard Kelly — for their skills and steady play.

Neither team has a win over an opponent that is a lock to make the NCAA Tournament, which is a tough way to go. Lunardi’s projection evidently reflects that. Michael Beller at SI.com also has WSU in his last four in.

The physical demands are different than in junior college and he doesn’t seem as bouncy as he did a few weeks ago.\nThis is the first time they’ve traveled this much, played this much against equal athletes and worked this much. WSU started in June and added 10 practices to the workload, plus four games, because of its trip to Canada.\nIt was just last week that Willis made 7 of 8 shots and scored 15 points against SIU.\nConference play is a lot about adjusting and adjusting again. There wasn’t as much of a book on Willis in November and December as there is now.\nWhile plenty of people question the talent in the MVC, few question the coaching. Teams are scouting and planning for Willis and faces a lot of double teams. Illinois State might not feel the need to double him as much, so perhaps he can get rolling again.\nOutdoors writer Michael Pearce says watch the migration of ducks and geese.

        "prompt": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif. – A state appeals court on Tuesday denied a petition by Scott Peterson&apos;s (search) attorneys who were seeking to overturn a ruling allowing the same jury that convicted Peterson to decide whether he lives or dies for his crimes.\nIn a petition to the 1st District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, attorney Mark Geragos (search) also asked to delay the start of the murder trial&apos;s penalty phase, set to begin Nov. 30, and to schedule a hearing on the issue.\nOn Monday, Judge Alfred A. Delucchi (search) denied the defense motion seeking a new jury in San Mateo County or a new jury somewhere else to decide whether Peterson should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole.\nAfter a five-month trial, Peterson, 32, was convicted Nov. 12 of one count of first-degree murder in the death of his eight-months pregnant wife, Laci, and one count of second-degree murder for the death of her fetus.\nGeragos wanted the high court to decide that Delucchi erred in his ruling, to order the penalty phase moved to another county and to seat a new jury, claiming that, among other things, the jury that found Peterson guilty is now tainted by public opinion.\nGeragos cited a frenzied mob who cheered outside the courthouse as the guilty verdicts were read.\nA three-judge panel of the apppeals court refused to intervene, issuing its denial within hours of the filing. Geragos can now appeal any sentence to same high court. The defense lawyer is expected to seek intervention from the state Supreme Court this week on his request for a delay.\nGeragos also claimed Delucchi wrongly sent jurors home after they reached a verdict instead of keeping the panel sequestered through the penalty phase.\nDaniel Horowitz, a criminal defense attorney and regular Peterson trial observer, predicted the appeals court would not intervene, adding that the move is standard strategy in a death penalty case. Defense attorneys often seek to insert as much time as possible between a guilty verdict and a penalty phase to allow for jurors&apos; emotions to subside.\nGeragos also cited the ousting of two jurors in two days during deliberations, noting that one, the jury&apos;s foreman, told the judge there had been threats to his safety and talk in the jury room of the \"popular verdict, the expected verdict.\" Both ex-jurors remain bound by a gag order.\nGeragos said the foreman asked to be removed because other jurors had become hostile to him and felt his decision would be compromised, according to the defense motion for a new jury filed last week.\n\"When I took the oath, I understood it to mean that I needed to be able to weigh both sides fairly, openly,\" Gregory Jackson told the judge before being removed, according to the defense motion. \"And given what&apos;s transpired, my individual ability to do that, I think, has been compromised to a degree that I would never know personally whether or not I was giving the community&apos;s verdict, the popular verdict, the expected verdict, the verdict that might, I don&apos;t know, produce the best book.\"\nJurors apparently became angered at Jackson&apos;s performance after electing him foreman. His replacement, an easygoing firefighter, told the court that Jackson, a lawyer and medical doctor, \"wanted to talk more than other people, and he tends to take a very long time,\" according to the defense motion.\nIn response, prosecutors said Geragos&apos; filing neglects to mention that Jackson \"completely retracted his claim\" he was pressured by other jurors when he was questioned by the judge.\nThe other juror was removed after she did her own research on the case, disobeying the judge&apos;s orders to consider only the evidence presented at the trial, according to the defense motion.\nIn denying the defense motions for a new jury and a move to another county, Delucchi called the case \"a problem without a solution,\" given the intense media coverage around the country.\nBut Geragos claimed the judge erred by not questioning each juror on the panel before dismissing its foreman.\n\"There&apos;s no requirement that Delucchi talk to every juror,\" Horowitz said, adding that Geragos presented no evidence that other jurors also felt public pressure.\n\"There&ap",

        "prompt": "Foursquare, Google Latitude and Facebook Nearby Friends failed to change the way we all meet up. That’s because intent, not location, is the most important thing when connecting people offline. If we want to meet up for food, coffee, drinks, the gym, a party or just to chill, it’s tough to know who else does too. It doesn’t matter if a friend is a block away if they can’t or don’t want to hang out. Always-on location sharing still freaks some of us out, and can drain battery life.\nBut the typical approach of calling, texting or posting on social media to see who’s available is broken too. You look desperate constantly badgering friends or broadcasting too widely asking to get together. The silence is deafening when no one responds. You feel uncool. Spraying push notifications at too large an audience or painstakingly choosing who to ping is discouraging.\nAnd like chat apps, products dedicated to aiding us assemble friends offline only really work if they achieve a level of ubiquity. If a few of your best buddies aren’t there, it’s pretty useless and you might as well resort to direct messaging.\nThat’s what kept Free from gaining traction, and fast-growing Down To Lunch has been criticized for unwanted invites. Because people are often only available to get together with friends a few times a week, it’s hard to achieve consistent use of a standalone app that drives growth instead of churn. Plus, if we’re not already looking there for another reason, people undecided about whether they’re trying to congregate can’t be seduced.\nThis is why Facebook Messenger and Snapchat are better primed to succeed at “gathering” than anyone else.\nIt’s an extraordinarily tough product to design right. But they have the reach (at least amongst the most social age group), style of product and sociology savvy to nail it. The question is if either can.\nThe only time I ever tried to build a company, it was to build this. The app was called Signal. We failed and shut down. There was too much friction to showing intent with wordy plans, it was impractical to constantly be annoying friends with pleas to see them and we couldn’t get people’s whole offline social graph to sign up.\nI’m not the only one who gave it a shot. There was Y Combinator president Sam Altman’s original startup Loopt. Facebook acquired both Gowalla and Glancee, two more attempts. Oh, and then there’s Banjo, Sonar, FacesIn and a dozen more that imploded.\nImagine if instead of just an online availability indicator, we had an “I want to meet up” offline availability indicator.\nTap a button, and your friends in your city or a subset of them could see you’re interested in socializing in the physical world. It’d last a few hours or until you turned it off, and could optionally include what you’re in the mood for. Your closest friends might get notified, but you wouldn’t necessarily have to alert them.\nFacebook Messenger has a whole People tab that’s hardly put to use. It shows your “favorite” friends to chat with, but they’re probably already near the top of your home tab list of chat threads. Yet its role as the top Western messaging app means people are opening it dozens of times per day.\nMessenger’s People tab could display your intent to hang out and you’d be one tap away from starting a chat thread to plan your rendezvous. And since it would just need general location and your explicit approval to function, not always-on exact location that is implicitly broadcast, it wouldn’t need the scary privacy opt out that cut down usage of Facebook Nearby Friends.\nIt’d be a little tougher to shoehorn the feature into Snapchat. There could be room on the Chat or Stories pages. Snapchat’s intense usage amongst teens and college kids with tons of free time to spend with friends could give an offline intent indicator enough visibility.\nBoth social networks want you to share more of your personal lives on their apps. Creating content that’s compelling and doesn’t seem awkward is a lot easier when you’re with friends. They’re your co-stars, your muses and your guides to experience. Becoming the app that fuels these offline meetups might make them the place to share the results.\nI believe this space is eventually destined for a winner, whether it’s Facebook, Snapchat or some startup like Down To Lunch.

Still, there’s no substitute for a friendly touch.\nCollege is seen as the pinnacle of social life because the condensed geography, flexible schedules, similar demographics and outgoing energy enable people to overcome the barriers to assembly. When all you have to do is walk down the hall of open doorways with a six-pack of beer, hanging out is simple.\nBut even being just a building away reduces the transparency and gathering gets harder. As we age, the distances grow to blocks or miles, and schedules fill up. We spend more time alone or just with our significant other. We miss out on laughter, inspiration, culture and collaboration. We sit in our houses or apartments and wish we were together, while our friends sit in theirs wishing the same.\nWe’re social creatures. It’s time our apps brought back what that really means.",

        "prompt": "Moments remains in its infancy, but could emerge alongside Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram as a core mobile app for the social network.\nFacebook's (NASDAQ:FB) mobile app is one of the most popular in the world. More than 1 billion people use Facebook on their mobile devices each and every day. But there's more to Facebook than its core social network.\nThe company has an increasingly impressive array of other apps, each boasting hundreds of millions of additional users in their own right. Collectively, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram reach 2.3 billion people each month, mostly through mobile devices. WhatsApp and Messenger lead the way with 1 billion and 900 million monthly actives, respectively; Instagram adds 400 million. The company has tried many times to add a fifth to that lineup, but most of its initiatives have been outright failures. Last year, Facebook discontinued Slingshot, Riff, and Rooms after they failed to gain sufficient traction.\nBut Facebook has one up-and-coming app that may hold considerably more promise: Moments, a photo-centric app Facebook launched last year, has remained one of the more popular apps in the app store since its debut.\nMoments is fundamentally a photo-sharing app, but not in a social networking sort of way. Moments is instead designed to make it easier to send private photos to friends.\nSay you and a friend both attend a party, during which you each take more than a dozen photos. The photos you took are on your phone, while the photos they took are on theirs. There are several ways you two could exchange them, including email, text message, or, if you both use iPhones, AirDrop. But these methods can be cumbersome, and perhaps too complicated for some users. Enter Moments: With Facebook's app, you can send entire catalogues of photos to your friends with a just a few taps.\nIt took Moments a few months to catch on, but by last fall it had emerged as one of more popular free apps in the app store, and has held relatively steady ever since. It's currently the 55th-most popular free app on the iTunes App Store, just behind familiar staples Chrome, Lyft, and Skype.\nIts popularity has been increasing in recent months. In February, Facebook announced that Moments users had shared more than 400 million photos since last June, with 100 million of those shared in February (via TechCrunch). Facebook has added additional features to Moments to make it more attractive, including the ability to share videos, and has also punished users unwilling to download it. In January, it removed support for automatic photo syncing on its core Facebook app, sticking it in the Moments app instead. Those that still want to use the feature must rely on Moments.\nAs it currently stands, Moments doesn't have any true direct competitors, but in time, it could become the go-to solution for photo management, at least among Facebook users. That could put it in direct competition with other photo apps, most notably Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Photos. Like Moments, Google Photos allows users to sort and share their photos, but also doubles as a free cloud-backup solution. Moments doesn't offer much in the way of cloud storage, but with its Facebook integration, it excels in terms of sharing.\nMoments and Google Photos also share a reliance on artificial intelligence. Each service includes a heavy machine learning component, through which they automatically scan, sort, and categorize images. Google Photos users can search for concepts such as \"cat\", \"screenshot\", or \"Florida\" and see relevant images from the photos they've taken. Moments lacks the complex search of Google Photos, but automatically categorizes photos based on the faces of the people in them. And if you're friends with them on Facebook, you'll automatically be prompted to share.\nDuring Facebook's most recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about the company's efforts in artificial intelligence, and cited Moments as a notable example.\n\"Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us, but we",
        "baseline": "'re already using it in lots of ways. Right now our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends.\"\nLater, Zuckerberg added additional color.\n\"...we are building this Moments app. So that way you can take photos on your phone and if use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend in them, with that person.\"\nAs it stands, Moments remains in its infancy, and is far removed from adding to Facebook's top or bottom lines. But if it remains popular, Facebook could eventually monetize it -- like its other apps -- through advertising. As Facebook's artificial intelligence technology becomes more capable, the company could deliver targeted ads based on the images users share with Moments.\nWith Facebook's core advertising business already firing on all cylinders, it doesn't need Moments to be a hit. But it could provide a source of growth in the years ahead.",

And we've been using it to improve the quality of our ads.\"\nMoments is a relatively new app, and it's still in its infancy. But it's already one of the most popular apps in the app store, and could emerge as a core mobile app for Facebook, alongside Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.",
        "llm_senso_medium": "'re already making progress,\" Zuckerberg said. \"For example, we built a new tool for our Moments app to help people find and share their photos with the people they care about most. It's a simple tool, but it's an example of a new kind of technology that we're building.\"\nThe company has also been working on a new tool for its core Facebook app, which will make it easier to search for photos. The tool, which is in testing, will allow users to search for photos by the people in them, even if they're not tagged. It will also allow users to search for photos by the location they were taken, and by the date they were taken.\nMoments may not be a core Facebook app, but it's certainly a vital one. It's a key tool for Facebook's efforts in artificial intelligence, and it may be the company's best shot at becoming a true photo-sharing and management app.",

Sam Brownback called the GOP-dominated Legislature into session to respond to a state Supreme Court order last month.\nThe court said the state's education funding system remained unfair to poor school districts despite three revisions of school finance laws in the past three years. The justices had warned that schools would not be able to reopen after this month if lawmakers didn't make more changes.\nThe governor and lawmakers expect the plan to satisfy the court.\nThe Kansas House has approved an education funding plan from Republican leaders that would boost aid to poor school districts to satisfy a state Supreme Court mandate and end a threat that the state's public schools might not reopen next month.\nThe vote Friday night was 116-6 on a bill that would increases aid to poor school districts by $38 million for 2016-17 by diverting money from other parts of state government.\nA Senate vote also was expected Friday night. Its approval would send the bill to Gov. Sam Brownback.\nTop Republicans in the Kansas Legislature have rewritten their education funding plan.\nThe plan unveiled Friday boosts aid to poor school districts by $38 million, just as a previous plan from Republican leaders did. It redistributes some funds from wealthier districts to meet a Kansas Supreme Court mandate to make the education funding system fairer to poor districts.\nIt does not rely as heavily on reshuffling of existing education dollars as the previous plan. Instead, it dedicates funds from the planned sale of assets of the Kansas Bioscience Authority to cover up to $13 million of the aid to poor schools. The authority was set up a decade ago to nurture Bioscience businesses.\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved the plan and the full House planned to debate it later Friday.\nA school funding plan from Republican legislative leaders is going back to committee in the Kansas House for potential changes.\nHouse Speaker Ray Merrick reassigned the bill Friday to the Appropriations Committee only a day after the panel approved it. GOP leaders faced dissention among Republicans over how to pay for a $38 million increase in aid to poor school districts for 2016-17.\nLegislators were in the second day of a special session to address a state Supreme Court ruling last month. The justices said the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor districts.\nThe GOP leader's plan decreases aid already promised to 141 of the state's 286 school districts to help poor ones. Critics say the Supreme Court wouldn't accept such a reshuffling of existing education dollars.\nThe Kansas Senate has rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have prevented the state's courts from closing schools in deciding future education funding lawsuits.\nThe vote Friday was 26-13, one vote short of the 27 needed for a two-thirds majority to pass a constitutional change.\nThe measure was a response to a state Supreme Court ruling last month declaring that the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor school districts. The justices warned schools might not reopen after June 30 if lawmakers didn't make changes.\nCritics said the proposal was designed to handcuff the courts.\nBut supporters said future school closure threats need to be eliminated. The proposal also would have prevented legislators from closing schools in response to a court order.\nModerate Republicans in the Kansas House have modified their plan for meeting a state Supreme Court mandate on education funding to make it more palatable to fellow lawmakers.\nRepublican Rep. Melissa Rooker of Fairway said a proposal to divert $6 million in unused economic development funds to public schools has been dropped because of potential opposition. Some Republicans have argued that the move would stymie job creation.\nRooker said the plan would instead divert existing education dollars set aside for school's emergency needs to boost aid for poor school districts. The moderate GOP plan still would tap $9 million in motor vehicle fees.\nThey're all elements of a plan to increase aid to poor school districts by $38 million for 2016-17 to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling last month.\nThe Kansas Senate is debating a proposed constitutional amendment that would prevent the state's courts from closing schools in deciding future education funding lawsuits.\nRepublican leaders expected the Senate to vote on the measure Friday. A two-thirds majority was needed for passage.\nThe proposal is a response to a state Supreme Court ruling last month declaring that the state's education funding system remains unfair to poor school districts.

Supporters said future school closure threats need to be eliminated. Critics said the proposal is designed to handcuff the courts.\nIf lawmakers pass the measure, it goes on the ballot in November.\nA problem with the Kansas House's sound system has forced state workers to bring in a substitute piece of equipment.\nWhen the House's staff arrived Friday morning, a big speaker in the chamber was making a loud popping noise every six seconds. The same problem occurred briefly Thursday morning when lawmakers convened a special session on education funding.\nHouse leaders turned the speaker off and warned members to keep side conversations down because it would be harder to hear any debates.\nWorkers then removed a speaker from the Statehouse's largest committee room, hooked it into the House's system and stood it up on a table next to the ailing speaker in the House chamber, securing it with long Velcro strips.\nAn attorney representing four Kansas school districts suing the state says he believes legislators would satisfy a state Supreme Court education-funding mandate by passing a plan from moderate Republicans rather than one backed by GOP leaders.\nLawyer John Robb said Friday that the plan circulated by Republican Rep.

They may work in a hospital setting, in a doctor’s office, a surgery center, nursing home or in an assisted care facility. Some RNs also work in corporate medicine as school nurses, at community health centers, in home health or in the military. Although the individual industries that RNs work in often dictate appropriate goals, elevating the standard of care for all patients while also taking professional career inventory should be top priorities.\nOften, registered nurses are responsible for attending to multiple patients during a single shift. Often, time is spread thin, so an important goal is to operate in the most efficient way possible. This might include improving time-management and multi- tasking skills, delegating more, as needed, and performing routine tasks in a highly organized manner. Ultimately, the outcome of this goal should be to have a completed shift in which all critical tasks are completed by the time of hand-off to the incoming shift. Ongoing professional development and participation in specialized training programs and professional workshops can help with this effort.\nWhile maintaining efficiency, RNs must be diligent and accurate in everything they accomplish. Goals in this area should include an in-depth understanding of intake, charting, vital sign assessment, as well as in discharge orders and instructions. Tools for measuring whether these goals are being met might include improved statistics on patient response time, or a reduction in reported errors. As different medical settings use different types of processes and procedures from each other, having a goal of an RN in a new setting should be that she should familiarize herself with the best practices specific to that facility.\nAt the heart of an RN's key duties is patient care. Often, time constraints may reduce the amount of time that nurses spend with individual patients, particularly when it comes to non-emergent issues, such as comfort care. A goal for improving patient care could include dedicating \"X\" number of minutes per patient, per shift, for providing comfort measures; assigning certified nursing assistants to perform this function; or, introducing trained, vetted volunteer staff to help non-medical, non-critical patient interaction.\nRegistered nurses frequently interact with, delegate and direct",

Since making the switch two years ago using a grant from Empire Health Foundation, the district has seen savings in its lunch program of about $3,200 a year and a drop in obesity rates among children. And, school officials say, kids love the food.\nGoing healthy hasn’t been as successful in many larger school districts, for reasons including the cost of new equipment, training and additional labor.\nChanges to the federal school lunch program inspired school districts to look at their approach to nutrition. In the past, many used quick, easy processed foods. The 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act aimed to change that. The law requires schools to serve more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and less sodium.\nMany districts are saying the changes have been too expensive and students have quit eating school lunches. Districts across the nation are asking for relief.\nThe national School Nutrition Association, which is made up of thousands of school kitchen workers, think schools should be granted waivers from the federal law because the cost of using more fruits and vegetables is too high.

        "prompt": "The standard operating procedure of the May government is to outsource immigration enforcement to the public, embedding borders in all sorts of different aspects of our day-to-day life. One of the chief ways it does this is through the 'right-to-rent' scheme, which is a far more dangerous development than it sounds. Now we finally have an independent assessment of the operation, via David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.\nThe right-to-rent scheme places a legal requirement on landlords and their agents to carry out immigration checks on all adults who will occupy a property before they enter into a tenancy agreement. The punishment for those who fail to do this are very severe. They face a civil penalty of up to £3,000 and a possible prison sentence of up to five years.\nBolt's inspection report, carried out throughout 2017, paints a stark picture of a scheme that is causing real harm to migrants - both documented and undocumented - people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and society at large. It appears to be being implemented with no meaningful oversight or monitoring whatsoever and is not even achieving its stated aim of reducing or controlling immigration.\nOver the three years since the scheme was first piloted, several migrant rights groups have raised concerns about the harm caused by this policy, including in homelessness, exploitation, and racial discrimination. The report suggests that they were entirely correct to do so.\nA number of organisations told Bolt that there was \"significant concern\" about increased homelessness resulting from right-to-rent. Local authorities have reported \"an increase in families applying for support\".\nHomeless charity Crisis raised concerns that the policy offered \"the potential for rogue landlords to perform illegal evictions, as there is no judicial oversight of the eviction process\". Meanwhile, rights afforded to tenants were removed in other pieces of legislation. They warned that the creation of landlords acting as border guards would prevent tenants \"from reporting and seeking local authority assistance with bad landlords or unsafe properties\".\nThe Migrant Rights Network gave evidence that many tenants were being forced into 'informal' accommodation where they were \"vulnerable to exploitation and abuse\". The Home Office's own evaluation of the pilot phase of the scheme confirmed these concerns, noting that \"the more exploitative end of the sector could increase as a result of the right-to-rent scheme\".\nResearch on the right-to-rent scheme by several migrant rights groups found evidence of increased racial discrimination against tenants. In truth, ethnic minority renters in the UK already face racial discrimination, but the policy is set to make it worse.\nAlmost half (42%) of landlords are now less likely to rent to someone without a British passport, which includes 17% of British nationals. Similar numbers said they would be less likely to rent to people who had the right to rent but were on a non-permanent visa or had documents the landlord was unfamiliar with. There is no mechanism for someone who believes they have suffered discrimination from a landlord to report it to the Home Office. They don't want to know.\nIt is clear that the government is not interested in monitoring the scheme, either in terms of performance or unintended outcomes.\nThe Home Office did complete an evaluation of the pilot phase prior to the wider roll-out, but they conceded that the decision to go ahead had, in effect, already been taken.\nThe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) told inspectors that the stakeholder body set up by the Home Office had no \"data gathering or evaluation function\" and would therefore be unable to properly monitor the scheme. It has not met since November 2016.\nFollowing a meeting with the Home Office last year, JCWI told Bolt that they \"remain deeply concerned that no robust or adequate system for monitoring and evaluating the scheme's operation and measuring its success, cost-effectiveness and proportionality has been put in place, nor is there any plan to do so\".\nThere is no evidence the policy is succeeding in its stated aim of ensuring people leave the country and in fact there is considerable evidence that it is failing.\nSince the introduction of the scheme the number of 'voluntary' returns has not increased. In fact, it has fallen. Over an 18 month period, there were 9,127 users of the government's voluntary returns scheme. Only seven of them cited their inability to rent property as a reason for wishing to leave the UK.\nIn response, officials told Bolt that it is \"important to think of the compliant environment measures as a 'suite' rather than trying to assess them individually\".\nWe should take them at their word. Assessing the hostile environment policies together, what have they accomplished?",

It means more work for already overstretch public servants. It means victims of crimes are afraid to report them. It has led to people dying before accessing hospitals. It has installed government surveillance in every aspect of everyday life. And – together with legal aid cuts and over 45,000 new immigration rules since 2010 – it has helped make it impossible for people to sort out their legal situation.\nBolt’s report notes that immigration enforcement's latest business model aims to reduce the 'harm' caused by undocumented migrants.

Hodor from “Game of Thrones,” actor Mehcad Brooks of “Supergirl,” and more.\nEven in the superhero universe, representation matters — especially to Baltimore.\nThe last-minute announcement left fans scrambling to cancel flights and hotel rooms and recoup the money they’d spent to prepare for the convention. Many said they were frustrated and angry — not just because the event was canceled, but because of the lack of communication from event planners.\nIt also means lost business for Baltimore hotels and restaurants and a large weekend vacancy at the city’s convention center on a prime spring weekend. Officials from Visit Baltimore could not be reached for comment Saturday.\nThe convention organizers did not respond to a request for comment, but apologized on Twitter to the people who were looking forward to the event, particularly those who already booked flights and rooms, and requested time off from work.\nIn their statement, organizers said they tried to supplement the insufficient funds by making “significant personal investments” and scaling back the convention to “create a leaner and more efficient show.” They also raised more than $56,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to help finance the show.\nThe convention has been two years in the making, with the stated goal of providing an event that “fosters true inclusion, diversity, and safety,” organizers wrote on their website.\nIt was supposed to have been a star-studded event, with planned appearances from Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor from HBO’s “Game of Thrones;” actor Mehcad Brooks of “Supergirl;” actor and comedian Orlando Jones of “American Gods;” “Star Wars” actor Billy Dee Williams; Grammy-winning artist Big Daddy Kane; and Kim Chi, a former contestant of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” according to a news release.\nIn response to frequent questions about refunds, organizers said they will honor people’s tickets whenever the convention is rescheduled.\nMany on Twitter complained that organizers bungled the announcement about the postponement. People who had made hotel reservations within a specific block of rooms received room cancellation emails from the hotel before organizers put out any official information.\nSandy Rosenblatt of Rockville bought a ticket to the Universal FanCon as a 44th birthday present to herself. She found out via Twitter on Friday that the event she was looking forward to — and had spent $300 on — was canceled. She said she didn’t get an official confirmation from the event organizers until Saturday afternoon.\n“There was a professional way to have done this and I don’t think that’s what they did,” Rosenblatt said.\nRosenblatt said she’s left thinking about how the $300 she used on FanCon could have been better spent on groceries, rent or paying back debt.\n“It�",

Because the announcement was made so last minute, they only expect to get about $50 back.\nWhen she first heard the news, Tupper thought it must be some cruel joke. Now, she’s left feeling numb and disappointed that she won’t be able to market the diverse comic series she works on, called Kamikaze.\nMany artists who had anticipated selling their work at the convention said an abrupt postponement translates into a big financial hit. Tupper and her husband put together a Tumblr page where people can find the work of vendors who planned to show at FanCon. They hope fans still might purchase merchandise and support the authors and artists.",

However, Disney is aiming to give the story its biggest blockbuster production yet, with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms gearing up for production. Last month, dancer Misty Copeland was the first star to be added to the movie, but now there's word that Interstellar actress Mackenzie Foy has been brought aboard as the movie's lead actress.\nAccording to Variety, Foy has been cast as Clara, the girl who is given a Nutcracker doll by her parents which later comes to life and takes its owner to a magical kingdom on a journey to defeat the evil Mouse King. While The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is primarily based on the original 1816 story, the use of Clara as the protagonist shows there will also be elements of the ballet incorporated into the movie.\nMackenzie Foy is arguably best known for playing young Murph Cooper in 2014's Interstellar, with Jessica Chastain playing the character as an adult. Foy also appeared in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2 as Renesmee Cullen, and she can be heard next month as The Little Girl in Netflix's The Little Prince.\nSo now The Nutcracker and the Four Realms has its main star, but she isn't the only casting that's been announced. THR dropped the news that the powerfully-voiced Morgan Freeman is joining the movie as the \"mysterious\" Drosselmeyer. In the ballet, Drosselmeyer was Clara's godfather, and he was the one who created the Nutcracker for her. Whether that same relationship will be retained in the movie remains to be seen, but with Freeman on board, this movie has some major Hollywood power behind it.

Since its launch five years ago, the Austin-based apparel line has operated as a women-led, inclusive, sustainably sourced, and ethically manufactured clothing line. With a mission such as this, MBS's effortlessly chic pieces are merely an added bonus.\nLed by Miranda Bennett, the company's owner, designer, and namesake, MBS is expanding from online and pop-up shops to a brick-and-mortar at 1211 E. 11th St., Ste. 101, beginning November 17, a move Bennett says is about more than expanding retail access.\n\"It will serve as a sanctuary,\" she says. \"Our store will exist as a place of discovery, where we can educate our customer about our process and where they can see and feel the entire MBS collection, as well as the artisans whose work we wish to highlight.\"\nThe same aesthetic and penchant for thoughtfulness that has turned MBS into a cult favorite among fans and fashion houses alike will extend to the new brick-and-mortar.\nMBS tapped local architecture firm Side Angle Side to design the space while KKDW, the Texas Hill Country design and fabricator shop, handcrafted the millwork from local pecan. True to form, the MBS team will create the store's upholstery using KKDW's leftover pecan shavings to dye the fabric.\n\"The second you walk through our doors, you will know where you are,\" says Bennett. \"[The space] will be a floor-to-ceiling tribute to our story, our apparel, and our partnerships.\"\nThe culture created outside of those doors, however, is what ultimately led the company to this milestone.

The company also works with New Leaf Agriculture, the agricultural arm of the Multicultural Refugee Coalition, to source plants for natural dye from the organization's nearby farm.\nBennett says partnerships like these, as well as collaborations with brands like Eileen Fisher and The Line, are the results of thoughtful growth. \"The journey has felt both slow and organic and lightning fast, all at the same time,\" she says. \"All of the decisions that have led to our growth and some of the wonderful partnerships ... come from a place of saying yes to what feels right, and constantly checking in with what our goals and mission are.\"",

        "prompt": "OAKLAND, Calif. – No one game is critical, Scott Servais will tell you (and his players will faithfully echo), and yet this one loomed as a gigantic marker for the Mariners. Disaster was lurking around every corner, behind every pitch.\nA loss would have been, let’s face it, devastating.\nNot fatal, but about as damaging as you can get at this stage of a season that still hangs in the balance for Seattle. To get swept by the team you are chasing, an Oakland team that is starting to believe it is touched by a higher baseball power, well, that would have been hard to come back from.\nIt’s a moot point, for now, because the Mariners pulled out about as tense and vital a victory as there is in a month that isn’t September, October or November. They won on a home run by a guy who never hits them, on a pitching gem by a guy who has mastered the art of deception, on the backs of a bullpen that kept wriggling out of danger.\nThey won 2-0 on Wednesday, in 12 innings, over an A’s club that the Mariners know they must somehow disabuse of the notion that they are a team of destiny. It was a small nudge in that direction, after two forceful pushes backward by Oakland, but it prevented what could have been another in a series of crises of confidence by a fan base that is constantly on a CSI-like hunt for signs of capitulation by the Mariners.\nEvery pitch, every out. It was that kind of game, in a series of those kinds of games, the kind that the Mariners are resigned to playing all the way to the finish line, close and excruciatingly stressful. The kind of game that they had mastered at one point this year, but then so have the A’s, in fact turning the master’s degree into a Ph.D. and surging past Seattle.\nNo one had more fun on Wednesday than Gordon after he incongruously muscled a home run to right field in the 12th inning, just his second of the year, just the 13th of his career. Gordon nervously waited for the Oakland right fielder, Stephen Piscotty, to catch it, because that’s the way his luck has been going, but when he didn’t, Gordon danced around the bases behind Mike Zunino, who had walked.\nWith the preternaturally dominant Edwin Diaz lined up for the bottom of the inning, the Mariners knew that they likely had just won this game on the sweet stroke of their skinniest player. Gordon kissed his biceps – in the Bay Area, they called that Kaepernicking long before he ever knelt for the anthem – and was engulfed by his teammates in the dugout.\nIt’s down to 40 games for the Mariners now, and they sit 2 1/2 games behind Oakland for the second wild card. They have seven games still to play against the A’s as well as six against the Astros. Yes, the Mariners once led Oakland by 11 games, so there has been a 13 1/2 game turnaround in two months, but they are still within reach, if only they stop playing .750 ball.\nIf Seattle finishes out of the playoffs, yet again, as the M’s have every year since 2002, 17 years of ever-growing anguish, it will be, I maintain, the most maddening and frustrating moment in franchise history. They have had far worse seasons – more than 100 losses five times – but expectations were quickly trampled in those years. They have had agonizing finishes, such as the abrupt and premature end to their 116-win season of 2001. But you can’t get too melancholy about a year in which the team set a record for victories.\nThis time, they got their fan base to believe it was going to happen.

If they can pull it back together, the narrative can be transformed again. This year’s Mariners’ team can still be remembered as the one that broke the drought, that pulled itself out of a tailspin, that defied every prediction of its demise and far surpassed every forecast of the lackluster year they were supposed to have.\nThat’s what’s out there these next 40 games over the next six weeks – lots more days and nights like Wednesday, when it seemed as if everything was riding on that game.\nIt wasn’t, but who’s going to believe that?",

        "prompt": "Job search engines are depressing. After endless browsing I feel like a restaurateur trying to find the perfect dessert - unsatisfied, unwell, and a little fatter than when I started.\nWith websites like Gumtree and Monster advertising thousands of jobs, the internet seems to offer endless possibilities, but hours of searching turn up scant results.\nI am writing as an arts graduate with a strong degree, but even with this qualification the chase can leave you despondent about the three years of study you have just completed, let alone your prospects for the future. Paid entry-level jobs for graduates are hard to come by, and those that there are often place emphasis on attributes other than your education.\nMy friend recently told me that the tipping-point of her interview at a major London auction house was not her Masters Degree in History of Art, but the fact that she was adept with a Twitter account. As David Cameron quipped, 'too many tweets might make a t***', but you could end up feeling like a t*** if you are unable to tweet.\nIn a recessive economy with a surplus of unemployed graduates it is often aspects other than education that can set you apart from the crowd, and one can be left feeling that a degree is not only superfluous but irrelevant.\nThis is especially true if you study a subject that doesn’t offer a well-defined career. I studied English and, in some respects, I am envious of my compatriots who took vocational subjects like Medicine or Law. They have the advantage of not having to spend gruelling hours, plastered to the Gumtree like a mosquito to be fossilised, trying to ‘choose’ a job.\nNot only is the path they need to follow to gain employment more obvious, but many such careers actively benefit from recession; more people fall ill in times like these, which generates business in the medical profession, and businesses tend to press their claims harder, so lawyers can make a profit.\nWhere, then, can the hapless graduate look for consolation? For one thing, it is more important now than ever before to remember that doing a degree is not just about getting a job. This, at least, is what I keep telling myself. Yet I also believe that a climate in which large numbers of graduates need to undertake a further course of study as unpaid interns to secure jobs is highly pernicious.\nI had a conversation with a judge recently who told me about a case in which an asylum seeker living in the UK had been informed that he would have to leave the country unless he earned in excess of an average of £18,000 per annum for three years.\nWhen workers earn money it is of an overall benefit to the economy; unpaid interns are not just less well-off themselves, they are also failing to contribute economically. The CIPD has been calling on firms to pay interns at least £2.50 an hour, and this writer is behind them.

Many companies would be deterred by the expenditure of running such schemes, with the result that internships themselves would become even thinner on the ground.\nSuch a loss would be significant where those internships that offer real prospects of leading to employment were concerned, but the only favourable consequence of those that don’t open any immediate doors is another entry on the CV.\nPerhaps those are the internships that would be worth eliminating, for such programmes provide a poisoned chalice, rendering graduate life an endless race to collect club-scout badges, each one leading to nothing but the next unpaid placement as you give away free labour. In an environment where we are not exactly spoiled for choice to begin with, it becomes ever more crucial to select carefully.\nSo on behalf of despondent graduates everywhere: avoid selling yourself short.

You are being used.\nThe government has recently announced that it will be introducing a new system of internships, which will be paid and will be designed to give young people the skills they need to get a job.

The government should also be looking at ways to make it easier for graduates to find jobs, and to make sure that the jobs they find are not exploitative.\nThe government should also be looking at ways to make it easier for graduates to find jobs, and to make sure that the jobs they find are not exploitative",

Of course, this is a solution that would require an increase in government spending, and the government is not going to be able to do that until the economy is in a better state.\nIn the meantime, the best advice I can give to graduates is to go out and get some experience.

First of all, take a step back from the internet. It can be an incredibly useful tool, but you can also get bogged down in it, and lose sight of the big picture. Secondly, don’t take rejection personally. It can be hard not to, but you need to keep in mind that you are not a person, you are a product. You are not a person, you are a product.

        "prompt": "It's a PKI race to the bottom in 2016. Advances in web site authentication have been rare and nothing inspiring is in the offing.\nIt's official now: Only suckers pay for DV (domain validated) TLS/SSL certificates (hereinafter just 'TLS'). Symantec, the dominant player in the market, is going to give them away through a partnership program with hosting services called Encryption Everywhere.\nEven if unofficial, it has probably been obvious for a while, at least since Let's Encrypt, a free open-source certificate authority (CA) run by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), came online last September. They recently issued their millionth certificate.\nSymantec might have argued that users recognize and trust the Symantec name more than they might \"Let's Encrypt,\" but even if this is true (and I doubt it) those users are making a mistake. No matter who issues it, a DV certificate proves very little about the authenticity of the site. I think Symantec is coming to accept that people know this, to the extent that they give it any thought at all.\nTLS certificates serve two functions: To provide a public key for encrypted communications, and authentication of the site. The encryption you have always been able to do with a self-signed certificate, which you can make for yourself for free. The problem with that is that modern browsers put up 5-alarm warnings when you browse a site with a self-signed cert and make you click several times to ensure you know you're doing something stupid. It's a strange approach considering that browsers don't hassle you when you go to a site with no TLS at all.\nThis approach also presumes that a DV cert issued by a trusted CA demonstrates a meaningful level of authentication. Does it? Yes, but not to a high enough degree that ordinary users who don't scrutinize site certificates should feel safe. All it proves is that the person who obtained the certificate had access to the email account of the site's registered administrative contact. The fact that anyone can easily get a free DV cert from the respectable and democratizing Let's Encrypt, rather than from a commercial CA, just makes matters worse.\nverify the name and address of the applicant using reliable information sources, such as a government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition or a reliable third party database. The CA also confirms the authenticity of the certificate request through some means of reliable communication with the organization (i.e. they verify that the certificate requester is an authorized employee/agent within the subscribing organization). For certificates issued to individuals, the CA verifies the individual's identity using a government-issued photo ID that is inspected for indication of alteration or falsification.\nClearly there is more cost involved in vetting an OV certificate application and a human being must be involved in the process as compared to the automated process for DV certs. An EV certificate requires even more human research and greater expense.\nBut with an EV certificate at least you get the clear identification of the entity holding the certificate. See the image below. At top is an EV certificate. At bottom is a non-TLS site. In the middle is either a DV or OV site, and therein lies a big problem. There's little incentive to spend more for an OV certificate when the user experience is the same as with a free DV certificate.\nTo be sure, OV is more valuable for B2B authentication and authorization in processes which don't necessarily have a visual component like the one above. In such applications EV is probably overkill, because you are mostly paying to be able to have the green bar. OV provides a stronger authentication",
        "baseline": " than DV and is probably strong enough.\nOf course, there is also the encryption of the communications. If you're concerned about Uncle Sam listening in on your web browsing, then it's a very good thing for everyone to be using TLS. But that's not the real threat users are facing. The problem is not exposure of bits on the wire, but the inability for users to know that they're visiting the site they intended to visit and that it's a safe site.\nEven EV does only a half-assed job of this, but it may be as much as we can expect. Unfortunately, DV and OV sites are no more inherently trustworthy than sites with no certificates. The certificates are no substitute for users keeping their eyes open and being able to recognize behavior that is not normal, something we can't reasonably expect of users.\nI haven't heard of any attempts to leapfrog past this fundamental weakness of the web. We use TLS certificates for it because we have nothing better.",

        "prompt": "The first thing you see as you enter the Victoria and Albert’s newly expanded Photography Centre is a huge plate camera on a wooden tripod. It belonged to Henry Fox Talbot, the founding father of British photography. In an adjacent glass case, an array of his other cameras are on show alongside his notebooks and an original copy of his photography book, The Pencil of Nature. The centre’s inaugural exhibition is Collecting Photography: From Daguerreotype to Digital, but it is the process of photography that is the intriguing subtext.\nThere are now two main galleries, rather than one, devoted to the V&A’s photography collection, which means there is now ample room to view the prints on display in an expanded context that illuminates their production. The most visible evidence of this is the vast glass display cases that house not just cameras, but early photography books, manuals, notebooks and periodicals as well as one given over to viewing early stereoscopic images. Most of the other changes made to these repurposed Victorian picture galleries are invisible to the eye, including the complex climate control technology that protects the prints.\nAmong the highlights in the first gallery is a grid of photographs from the collection of Chauncy Hare Townshend, the 19th-century poet, clergyman and mesmerist who – alongside Prince Albert – was the only private English collector of early prints. Among them are various pictorial rural landscapes, a studio portrait of British bare knuckle boxing champion Tom Sayers and the strangely atmospheric Study of Sheep, taken in 1854, by Camille Silvy, who moved easily between the studio, the street and the countryside in search of subject matter, and who was described by his more famous contemporary Nadar as a “zélateur” or enthusiast.\nStranger still is an early portrait of a slumbering hippopotamus by the extravagantly titled Don Juan, Mario Isidro de Borbon, Count of Montizón. The setting is London Zoo, where the hippo drew huge crowds, having been captured on the banks of the White Nile and brought to London as a gift for Queen Victoria.\nLater in the gallery, a seemingly conceptual arrangement of objects – gloves, coins, nails, pieces of rope and fabric – turns out to be a bizarre still life also taken in London Zoo by Frederick William Bond. It is titled Contents of an Ostrich’s Stomach. Close to The Pencil of Nature is the first commercially produced photography book, one of Anna Atkins’s beautiful botanical studies from 1854, Festuca Ovina (Fescuie Grass). Atkins is now acknowledged as both the first female photographer and the first person to make a photography book. Her cyanotypes were created without a camera by placing specimens directly on to chemically treated paper and allowing sunlight to create a painterly silhouette effect.\nAmid the many early photographs that nod compositionally to paintings, there are some prescient moments that seem almost modernist. Frederick Holland Day’s 1905 Head of a Girl, Hampton, Virginia, is a blurred, slightly off-centre portrait of a young black girl that has a timeless quality. Likewise, the full-length self-portrait by Edward Steichen from 1933, in which he poses as if on the threshold of a doorway, which is actually a tiny blank empty picture frame on the wall behind him.\nSteichen is a definite presence here, with a glass case housing spreads from his groundbreaking journal Camera Work, published quarterly from 1903 to 1917. His striking colour portrait of socialite and Vanity Fair editor Clare Boothe Luce dates from 1938, but looks as if it could have been taken just a few years ago. An even more surprising example of early colour is an impressionistic Amsterdam street scene from 1934 by Bernard Eilers, in which blurred shop lights are reflected on a wet street in a haze of dark blues and reds. Elier’s atmospheric image anticipates the painterly style of Saul Leiter’s New York street photographs made two decades later.\nAgainst all this invention, the work in the second gallery seems almost from a different exhibition. The highlight for me is the large grid of 30 street photographs by Mark Cohen. His oddly composed, closeup images of children and teenagers on the streets of his hometown, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, gleefully disrupt the usual tropes of street photography. This is a dance of gestures and shapes: hands, feet and arms filling the frame, facial expressions and skin tones caught in warm natural colours. Cohen’s style is so singular that these images add up to an exhibition within an exhibition.\nIt was also good to come upon a characteristically gritty street tableau by the elusive Graham Smith, arguably the most gifted and certainly the least known of a generation of British documentary photographers working in the 1970s and 80s.\nOn a street in his hometown – South Bank near Middlesbrough – in 1982, Smith asked a passing couple to pose. The man balances shopping bags and boxes on a pram, while the woman holds a garish painting of Elvis Presley. The title is What She Wanted and Who She Got. This is English gritty realism writ large, by turns caustically funny and oddly melancholy.\nThere is also a recently acquired series of the late Linda McCartney’s work, the most intimate being her portraits of her family when they lived in relative seclusion on the Mull of Kintryre in the early 70s. In one, Paul in a dressing gown balances on a fence, while his son, James, jumps off a Land Rover and one of his daughters crouches in the grass. It is a study of domestic ordinariness – albeit on a 600-acre estate – at a time when the ex-Beatle was in retreat from his own myth.\nThis intriguing exhibition culminates with two special commissions that use early art works from the V&A collection as their conceptual starting points. Thomas Ruff riffs on the architectural images of the Victorian soldier-photographer Linnaeus Tripe for a series of interventions titled Tripe/Ruff. (Wouldn’t Ruff/Tri",
        "baseline": "pe be a more phonetically satisfying title?) Ruff has digitally manipulated Tripe’s negatives and then blown up the prints so they become even more detailed. The results are fascinating in a cerebral way – especially Tripe’s painted-on clouds.\nPenelope Umbrico’s inordinately slow-moving video piece, 171 Clouds from the V&A online collection, inaugurates the newly constructed Light Wall. Umbrico has extracted details of clouds from the V&A’s archive of paintings, digitally stitching them together to make a vertical “art sky”.\nHow much you appreciate both pieces will depend on your tolerance for art about art, and it might be better to approach Umbrico’s piece, in particular, on a separate visit. That aside, there is more than enough richly inventive work in the two main galleries to sustain several hours of slow looking.\nV&A Photography Centre opens on 12 October.",

It is a space that is both intimate and expansive, and it is a pleasure to see the V&A’s photography collection displayed in such a way that it is possible to see the process of photography as well as the finished product.\nCollecting Photography: From Daguerreotype to Digital is at the V&A, London SW7, until 7 January 2018.",

        "prompt": "One of the worst parts of traveling is the luggage part. Airlines have almost made it a sin (for which we must be punished) to have even one bag bigger than a wallet. The airlines do not care if we are going to be away from home for one hour or one year, baggage is evil and must be stowed away (for a fee), hidden as soon as we enter the cabin (with limited space), almost impossible to access during flight, and bounced and dropped by handlers as we wait (ever more anxiously) for our precious stuff to show up on the carousel after a flight. When did luggage become immoral and wicked?\nMany pieces of luggage are lost when passengers change planes. In 2016, 47 percent of all cases of delayed bags occurred between connecting flights, especially those with small time frames. Misplaced baggage is more than annoying to passengers, it is expensive to the airlines as recovering and returning lost bags costs the aviation industry $2.1 billion (2016).\nThe hope for the future is based on RFID tracking – making Resolution 753 an industry-wide reality. The SITA Baggage Report estimates the cost of implementing RFID at $0.10 per passenger, generating a savings of $0.20 per passenger. RFID could save the industry more than $3 billion over the next 7 years by improving baggage management and operations, and, of course, improve the quality of life for the passengers.\nIt is reassuring to note that our dearly loved bags may soon have a better chance of joining us as we travel, however, we are still faced with a problem: what to do with the luggage between the time we check out of a hotel or a B&B and arrive at the airport (or train/bus station).\nIn the “old days” the hotel concierge would stow the bags for a minimal charge (or tip), allowing guests the freedom to explore for the day, return for their precious cargo, and head to the station. Today, many hotels have ceased this service under the guise of liability.\nThere was a time hotel management permitted late check-outs (up to 4 PM) to accommodate guests with late transportation departures. Currently, unless you have a special credit card, or received dispensation from a manager, the opportunities to linger in your room and stay close to your luggage, are non-existent…you are expected to have vacated your room by 1 PM (the latest).\nEven if the hotel permits you to leave your bags to explore, it is likely that the accommodations are located in remote areas – not even close to the nearby city, park, mountain, mall – you want to investigate.\nSo, the question remains: what to do with luggage in that time/space continuum between the hotel check-out and the transportation check-in.\nWhat to do? Your flight does not leave for many hours, the airline will not permit early check-in and even if you wanted to hang out at the airport, airlines may not permit early check-ins.\nAn overnight success story (that has taken two years to fund), started when two enterprising millennials had their own dismal experience (schlepping 3 large pieces of luggage around Los Angeles).

        "prompt": "Paul Buijs has had a lot of jobs over his lifetime but his new one might be among the shortest. He was a Marine, a Florida cop and an NYC-based U.S. air marshal. During that period, the most dangerous thing he saw wasn’t on a plane but on the subway to the airport: a drugged-out straphanger threatening a woman in the wee hours of the morning. He’s been a fitness studio manager and is starting a fitness events website, but in the meantime he’s also organizing a not-exactly-sanctioned Citi Bike race.\nThe race (which is being branded as “NOT A RACE,” just in case) is being held 9 a.m. Saturday. The winner is the rider who shows the quickest time from somewhere north of 100th Street to somewhere south of Houston on the iron horses, measured by the Citi Bike app. Choose your own route. The male and female winners each get prizes, including some fitness classes and 100,000 New York Coins, a local crypto currency. May the best bike-share warrior win.\n“I hope I don’t get sued,” says Buijs, 40. To protect himself, the full $30 entry fee goes straight to charity, and the only thing Buijs gets is a bit of buzz for his new website. He says the race is a one-time deal.\nBut there’s something entertaining about the thought of a Citi Bike race flashing downtown. It’s taking an amateur’s tool to a realm of highly specialized gear. It advances an “anyone can do it” ethos in the biking world. You can’t take yourself too seriously if you’re hustling on a Citi Bike, but it does the job.\nWithout much publicity, Buijs has just under 40 people signed up for his regular-person unofficial not-a-race. He’s gunning for 200.\nSo, for a few weeks, his new pseudo-job is bike-race promoter. On a recent publicity push, Buijs took an afternoon to distribute flyers, including at Chrome Industries, a gear shop on Mulberry Street that is much more on the serious side of biking. There he met Francisco Colón, 35, a store manager and racer.\nIf Buijs is your everyman roadster, Colón is a real cyclist. Buijs has ridden in a few casual races and has great stamina. Colón raced in the Red Hook Crit, a wild and crash-prone event that took place in April on a wet course in Brooklyn. Buijs sold his road bike for rent after quitting the air marshall job and now exclusively uses Citi Bike (he’s 750 miles in). Colón has some five bikes, but generously offers that he likes Citi Biking and has done it on occasion when trying to go somewhere, particularly when it’s raining. “The bike itself is rad,” he says.\nColón gamely questions Buijs about some of the race mechanics. Could you have the bike undocked and get a running start?\n“There’s always a way to cheat the system,” says Colón, grinning devilishly.\nColón thinks out loud about the fastest route. Buijs guesses the West Side Highway. Colón says that for real street racers, a straight shot through traffic would be quicker. That kind of bravado riding is par for the course in so",

There, he turned down chilled rosé and instead handed out flyers, pitching the race and admiring a thematic art exhibit on the wall. The objects were meditations on old NY subway tokens, a pre-Citi Bike means of travel.\nThe artist, in attendance, explained that he accepted crypto for his work but hadn’t yet made a sale that way. It’s tough to hustle up a good idea from scratch, as the artist and Buijs and alleycat route planners and Citi Bike users know well. Still, everyone in New York has to be open to new opportunities.",

She had 26 points, 24 rebounds and two blocks – one of which was an earth-shattering rejection that sent waves throughout The Hump and a message to the visiting Gamecocks.\nThe context of Staley’s comment could come as a surprise, though. Staley wasn’t angry about her team’s inability to stop McCowan on either end of the court. She even said she can live with the type of numbers McCowan had.\nShe can’t live with what Mississippi State’s other key contributors did.\nSenior guard Jordan Danberry averages 13.4 points per game. She had 20 against South Carolina. Sophomore guard Bre’Amber Scott averages 6.4 points per game. She had 11 against the Gamecocks.\nEven senior point guard Jazzmun Holmes, who is looking to be more of a playmaker than a scorer on any given night, chimed in with 12 points against a South Carolina team that prides itself on defense.\nMississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer doesn’t like to go deep into his bench, especially in games as important as Thursday night’s. So when sophomore forward Chloe Bibby went down with a season-ending knee injury in the game’s first minute, he needed heightened production from other players.\nWith the exception of an off-night from Anriel Howard, the team’s second-leading scorer, he got what he needed. Howard had a rough shooting night as she went 3-of-13 from the field and only had 11 points. She also got into foul trouble, which negatively affected her performance even further.\nIn addition to Danberry and Holmes’ above-average games, Scott truly made the difference for State.

Scott gave Schaefer 27 minutes in a game Schaefer said was as big as any regular season game could be.\n\"When you get in that moment tonight, you’ve got to play,\" Schaefer said. \"You’ve got to function. Truly, there aren’t many bigger stages than what we had tonight in that game.\"\nThe rest of Schaefer’s bench – freshman point guard Myah Taylor, freshman center Jessika Carter and sophomore guard Andra Espinoza-Hunter – only played 29 minutes combined.

Never mind the smattering of cheesy souvenir shops, tattoo parlors and psychic-reading emporiums; Beale Street's sultry call is irresistible.\nThis summer the city will celebrate with ''50 Years of Rock 'n' Roll.'' The festivities will reach a peak on July 5, the anniversary of the day in 1954 when Elvis Presley, who was 19, walked into Sun Studio, crooned ''That's All Right'' into the microphone and won over Sam Phillips, the skeptical owner of the studio, with his rendition of the old blues song. It was, of course, an overnight sensation, even if the exact birth date of rock 'n' roll is open to debate.\nSince then, Memphis has spawned dozens of singers, from Otis Redding and Tina Turner to Jerry Lee Lewis and Justin Timberlake. Isaac Hayes and Sam the Sham will be among those on hand to celebrate.\nOn Sept. 10, Memphis will open the $250 million FedEx Forum, right behind Beale Street downtown, which, at the request of the resident Memphis Grizzlies basketball team, plays up the city's music theme.

At least not in the view of Kevin Starr, a partner at Third Rock Ventures, which helped found Agios in 2008, providing part of its $33 million Series A funding. In April 2010, Summit, NJ-based Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) poured its first $130 million into Agios, and on Oct. 5, it extended the deal to four years from three, for another $20 million. “From a size standpoint, this is the largest partnership we have among any of our portfolio companies by a wide margin,” Starr says.\nAgios and Celgene are working on a new class of drugs designed to starve cancer cells of key enzymes. Celgene had the option to extend the deal under the original agreement, but virtually no one expected the company to exercise that right so soon. Although Agios has identified several lead clinical candidates, it could be as long as two years before any of them are ready for human trials, says Agios CEO David Schenkein. “What’s most important to us is not the dollars” involved in the Celgene deal, Schenkein says, “but the statement Celgene is making. It shows they’re confident in Agios as a partner.” Celgene has the right to extend the deal again, as well as an exclusive option to license any of the drugs for an undisclosed period of time.\nCancer metabolism is the study of enzymes that alter the metabolism of cancer cells by feeding them nutrients they need to grow.

Starr, who served as the company’s founding CEO, describes the company’s first nine or so months as a carefully calculated effort of integrating diverse scientific disciplines, translating a broad idea into solid intellectual property, and ultimately finding a partner with deep pockets and a common vision.",

Eric Greitens shared details of his new tax proposal on Monday, Jan. 29 during a visit to Palmyra, discussing a new plan that would result in tax cuts for 97 percent of Missouri taxpayers if approved.\nGreitens spoke with scores of people gathered at Doyle Manufacturing, outlining how his tax plan was focused on helping working Missourians and driving business growth. Greitens stressed that the tax cuts would continue to increase jobs and revenue. With unemployment rates at their lowest level in 17 years for the Show Me State, Greitens said more prosperity was on the way through the new plan.\n“We're going to be bringing more jobs and higher pay to the people of Missouri,” he said.\nIf approved, Greitens' tax plan would cut back certain regulations and loopholes — like bonuses to corporations for filing taxes on time and incentivizing companies to hire out-of-state employees — and would reduce corporate income tax rates from 6.25 percent to 4.25 percent. That tax rate would be the second-lowest level in the nation. The plan also called for a revamp to a decades-old law Greitens said would remove the tax burden for 380,000 working-class Americans.\nGreitens said Missouri taxpayers who earned more than $9,072 each year were classified under the top income tax rate based on an existing 1971 law. The tax cut proposal would cut the tax rate for those residents from 5.9 percent to 5.3 percent. Greitens also touted a “Workers First” tax cut, which would enact a 20-percent non-refundable credit against tax liability based on the existing federal earned income tax credit system.\nGreitens said the",

He said Department of Revenue staff studied 7,000 different scenarios, reinforcing Greitens' statements that 97 percent of Missourians would receive a tax cut and 380,000 working-class families would not pay anything on their tax bill.\n“If we do this together — if we stand up together and say we're going to fight for a system that rewards working families and rewards businesses for hiring people, and building here in the state of Missouri... — we're going to take this state in a new and better direction,” he said. Jeff Bettitt, Electrician and Supervisor of the Electrical Department at Doyle Manufacturing, agreed that Greitens' plan would provide far-reaching benefits for Missourians.\nBettitt said that aspects like the corporate income tax break would lead to improved working conditions and the ability to upgrade facilities more often — which he said would benefit people throughout the region.",

        "prompt": "LAREDO, Texas (CN) — “I am not Rana,” an innocent man indicted in a Mexican drug cartel conspiracy, and jailed for 36 days, says he told DEA agents who arrested him and insisted he was a drug dealer known as the Frog.\nFelipe de Jesus Gonzalez-Flores sued the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration and its agent in charge in Houston, Joseph Arabit, on Tuesday in Federal Court.\nGonzalez, 48, a legal U.S. resident through his marriage to a citizen, is a man of routine. On the morning of Feb. 18, 2015, he went to get coffee at a Laredo McDonald’s before heading to work at his one-man car wash, as he had done for years.\n“He was sitting at the McDonald’s by himself — drinking his coffee — when he received a phone call on his cell phone. The caller-ID on his cellular phone showed the call coming from a ‘Restricted Number,'” the complaint states.\nThe caller identified himself as a police officer and said he had some questions for Gonzalez, who agreed to meet him at the McDonald’s.\n“Mere minutes later, Mr. Gonzalez-Flores noticed approximately 30 armed men — some in camouflaged uniforms, others in civilian clothing with badges hanging on their necks, others with military style goggles and helmets, carrying military-style rifles — running around outside the McDonald’s,” the lawsuit states.\nScared and confused, Gonzalez says, he walked outside with his coffee and saw more armed men in unmarked black SUVs and they asked him to identify himself, which he did.\nRana is Spanish for frog.\nThe DEA agents and Laredo police were executing a warrant on a federal grand jury indictment, accusing Gonzales-Flores of involvement in a Los Zetas cartel ring that smuggled tons of marijuana from Mexico into Laredo, shipped it to Dallas, sold it there and sent the money back across the border.\nThe Zetas are an offshoot of Mexican security forces, many of whom received U.S. training. Their founding members worked for the Gulf Cartel but split off and formed their own cartel in early 2010.\nGonzalez says the agents arrested him and asked if he wanted to leave his pickup at the McDonald’s or take it to his car wash. On the drive to the car wash, he says, the agents interrogated him without reading him his Miranda rights.\nOne officer asked him: “Where did you disappear to all this time? Where have you been all this time, Rana?” Gonzalez’s attorney wrote in the 33-page complaint.\nGonzalez says the agents ignored him when he said he had been living a simple life for eight years, leaving his modest Laredo home each morning, stopping by McDonald’s for coffee, going to his car wash, “where day-in and day-out he would wash cars in the scorching Laredo heat — shirtless and in plain view of any passerby” and going to a local bank two or three times a week to deposit cash from his car wash.\nGonzalez was taken before a U.S. magistrate judge who declined to set a bond for him, or appoint him an attorney.\nHis wife had to borrow $10,000 to pay for his defense and he spent 36 days in federal custody — five days in Webb County jail and the rest in a prison outside Laredo owned by the GEO Group, a private prison company. After he spent five weeks and a day in jail, the government filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.\n“No explanation was provided by the prosecutors of the United States Attorney’s Office as to why the indictment was being dismissed against Mr. Felipe Gonzalez-Flores,” the complaint states.\nDespite his release from custody, and his innocence, Gonzalez says, the damage to his reputation lingers on the Internet and in public records.\nIn January this year, nearly a year after his arrest, a PACER search of federal court records brought up his name as a defendant in the case.\nA Google search of “Felipe Gonzalez-Flores Laredo”",

        "prompt": "Immigration Resolution Now Criticizes \"Amnesty\"\nUPDATED: Months after it was first drafted, a resolution seeking to inform Congress that Texas supports efforts to overhaul the country’s broken immigration system has been changed to gain support from Texas Republicans.\nThe House State Affairs Committee gave preliminary approval to HCR 44 on Thursday evening. It passed following an 8-2 vote.\nEarlier, state Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, said that in addition to adding language that specifically criticizes amnesty, the text of the original resolution was also changed to favor a path to “earned legal status” and not citizenship.\nIn order to be considered by the full House, the measure must appear on the House calendar by Tuesday.\nHoping to win conservative support, legislators have added stronger opposition to amnesty to a resolution urging Congress to reform immigration laws. House Concurrent Resolution 44, by state Reps. Ana Hernandez Luna, D-Houston, and Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, was initially drafted in February but finally got a hearing from the House State Affairs Committee late Wednesday.\n“I feel that we are at a point where immigration reform is imminent and Texas should be speaking with a strong voice on this issue,” Anchia said. “Texas has as much to gain with comprehensive immigration reform as it has to lose” without it.\nInitially, the nonbinding resolution included key talking points from Republican groups that urged reform, including the Cato Institute and the Partnership for a New American Economy. Language citing a 2006 study by the state comptroller, which showed that deporting millions of Texans in the state illegally would have resulted in a loss to the state’s gross domestic product of $18 billion, was also included, as were statements of support for immigration reform from former state Reps. John Garza, R-San Antonio, and Raul Torres, R-Corpus Christi. Those are still in the measure, but Anchia said it was necessary to change some of the language due to what he said was conservative opposition to anything hinting at amnesty.\n“Nobody in this House supports outright amnesty but rather an earned legal status,” Anchia said.

Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, who worked with Anchia to draft a resolution more palatable to House Republicans.\nBill Hammond, the president of the Texas Association of Business, said supporting the reform effort was timely, and would also address one of the key concerns many stakeholders have.\nThe committee didn't vote on the resolution.

They keep the major customer contacts and supplier relationships to themselves. Operational logistics and other key aspects of the business aren’t documented. As a result, the primary source of the firm’s success walks out the door as soon as the deal closes. Having a management team capable of continuing the business uninterrupted will improve sale prospects.\nDue diligence can uncover shortcomings in a company’s recordkeeping. These might include out-of-date customer contracts and regulatory reporting, vague and incomplete marketing or production information, and inaccurate inventory tracking. Without thorough and accurate records, purchasers won’t know what they’re buying and will be reluctant to close the deal.\nSome people put a positive spin on information at the expense of accuracy. The first time a buyer discovers something factually incorrect, suspicions start. If more inaccuracies are revealed, things get worse. Even if the exaggerations don’t add up to much, many buyers will walk away for fear there is a larger surprise hidden in the shadows.\nConfront a strategic weakness head on. For example, you may not have an HR manager, but realize you have a bunch of personnel headaches you have yet to deal with. While you may not be able to correct the issue before the sale, letting the prospective owner know the problem in advance can turn it into an opportunity – perhaps the acquirer has a fully integrated HR department that could pick up the slack. Regardless, trying to hide the issue raises suspicions.\nIf your company’s being sued or you are pursuing a suit against another entity, and either lawsuit could materially impact your business, there isn’t much chance you’ll be able to sell until everything’s sorted.\nIf there’s any environmental contamination on your business property, the chance of selling is greatly diminished. You must complete environmental testing and, if necessary, remediation before a deal can be done. For minor cleanup issues, a Phase 1 environmental audit (which inspects and reviews past uses of the land) and disclosure of the problem is probably enough. However, many deals have broken down over these concerns.\n“Normalizations” is the polite term used to reference expenses that won’t recur under new ownership. It’s often a euphemism for personal expenses put through a business to minimize taxes, such as salaried spouses and children who provide little or no services to the company. Normalizations come in many forms. I once asked an owner of a consumer products business about the “marine equipment” item on the income statement. Turns out it was expenses related to a yacht he used for corporate entertaining — not something that generally passes muster with Revenue Canada as an eligible business expense. Someone who plans to sell a company in the next year or two should eliminate or minimize normalizations on the income statement and stop running personal expenses through the business. Doing this will increase the value and price the business eventually sells for, since earnings will be higher and most valuations are based on a multiple of earnings. It will also reduce the number of embarrassing conversations about dubious accounting practices.\nThis often occurs when a vendor is uncertain about selling. When",

In a sense, the TBS marketing team’s challenge is to effectively help fans break a 32-year habit, inasmuch as the national semifinals have aired on CBS since 1982.\nWhile the various executions are literally too numerous to list, suffice it to say that the usual suspects are all in play. There are linear spots running in heavy rotation on TBS, TNT, truTV, CNN and HLN, a color strip ad in Friday morning’s USA Today, digital out-of-home displays in 31 markets, and an integration with NCAA.com.\nOn game day (Saturday, April 5), TBS will tap a number of digital outlets, including Xbox, Pandora, YouTube, Spotify, Facebook and Twitter. A day-long homepage takeover of the USA Today site is also set to tip off tomorrow morning.\nSaturday also marks the debut of TBS’ Teamcast coverage, which is designed to super-serve diehard fans of Florida, UConn, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Along with the national broadcast on TBS, which reaches 98.6 million households, Turner will simulcast each game on two of its other networks. For example, when the Huskies and Gators square off in the first game, a Florida-centric telecast will run on TNT while a UConn-friendly presentation can be seen on truTV. The same applies to the 8:49 p.m. EDT game (Wildcats-Badgers).\nWhereas the primary telecast will feature CBS Sports’ Jim Nantz and Greg Anthony and TNT’s Steve Kerr, the Teamcast games will be called by announcers with ties to a particular team. For example, the UConn truTV simulcast will be called by CSN New England’s Eric Frede and former Huskies small forward Donny Marshall.\nAlong with catering to each team’s fan base, the Teamcast coverage promises to generate some incremental ad sales revenue for Turner and CBS.\nThe 2013 Final Four averaged 15.7 million viewers and a 9.4 household rating, up 3 percent from the previous year. Louisville-Wichita State drew 14.5 million viewers and an 8.7 HH rating in the early window, while Michigan-Syracuse scared up 17.1 million fans and a 10.2 HH rating.\nPer Kantar Media, Turner and CBS together raked in $1.15 billion in March Madness ad sales revenue, marking the second consecutive year the two partners generated a 10-figure haul.

The top advertisers in last season’s tournament were General Motors, which invested $80.7 million, AT&T ($70 million), Anheuser-Busch InBev ($38.9 million), Coca-Cola ($37 million) and Capital One ($36.8 million).

        "prompt": "Marx or Madison: Which Revolutionary Do You Stand With?\nThis is a rush transcript from \"Glenn Beck,\" January 4, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nGLENN BECK, HOST: We&apos;re kicking off the new year, 2010, with final arguments on all the big issues that we laid out the case last year. You need to make a decision before we can move forward.\nDo you believe many of the people in the White House follow the beliefs of this revolutionary? This is James Madison. Or this revolutionary, Karl Marx? You have to decide, because it really is one or the other. It&apos;s either James Madison or Karl Marx.\nYou can&apos;t just take a pinch of Madison and add a dash of Marx; they&apos;re diametrically opposed to each other. I will tell you that I am presenting one side of the argument. I desperately would like the other side of the argument. I try to do my homework as I showed you earlier today.\nBut unless that phone rings, this is the only side of the argument you will hear because the White House will not call to refute anything. They refuse to set the record straight. Instead, all they do is attack. They attack me. They attack this network. They attack tea party goers. You name it — anyone who stands in their way.\nThe White House has only responded to myself and FOX by saying, \"It&apos;s not really a news network at this point.\" Well, some of the George Soros-funded, Hillary Clinton-created liberal blogs named me, as I told you earlier, mis-informer of the year.\nWell, gee, it&apos;s funny, because they weren&apos;t able to come up with a single lie or piece of actual misinformation. They only listed several of my opinions and then they disagreed with those and responded with their opinions. That is called debate.\nThis is a tactic from the radical leftist Saul Alinsky. Talk about the facts, guys. No, no, no. Instead, Saul Alinsky — he said, pick the target. Freeze it. Personalize it and polarize it. That&apos;s what they&apos;re doing. It&apos;s a distraction.\nAnd it&apos;s a dangerous distraction because they&apos;re moving on with their agenda. Well, I&apos;m done, America, and I hope you are about finished with this distraction and this game. Until we&apos;re having an open and honest debate — and we know where everyone is coming from, truly, case closed.\nI&apos;ve been showing you the evidence tonight and here is some more. I&apos;ve just mentioned this guy, Saul Alinsky. Not a lot of people know who this guy was at least two years ago. They had no idea of Saul Alinsky. Many in America still don&apos;t know who he was.\nWell, let me tell you, he was a radical leftist who wrote the book — in fact, I have it on the stack over there — \"Rules for Radicals.\" He wanted to take from the haves and give to the have-nots. That&apos;s not this revolutionary. That&apos;s this revolutionary.\nHe wouldn&apos;t put a label on himself, but that puts you much closer to Marx than Madison. He also said, \"The ends justify almost any means.\" He also said, quote, \"Success or failure is determinant of ethics.\"\nOK, that&apos;s weird. It always thought ethics and morals were the starting point. But not according to Saul Alinsky. See, ethics start — either start at the ethics — that&apos;s more Madison than Marx. To Saul Alinsky, those are just an afterthought.\nSaul Alinsky is irrelevant in today&apos;s world. That&apos;s what the left will tell you. That&apos;s what the left - the left will mock you, \"Oh, they&apos;re bringing up some `60s radical again. Oh, please, he&apos;s old news.\" Is he?\nDo you remember this photo? Let me show you the photo. Remember this? This is President Barack Obama, Professor Barack Obama back in Chicago. No one in the media bothered to look at what he wrote on this blackboard. I did, a couple months back.\nIt did the journalist&apos;s job for them. Here they are. Can you show that? Here I am, showing it&apos;s November 18th. You know what he was teaching? He was teaching Saul Alinsky. This is Saul Alinsky&apos;s tactics. It&apos;s spread the wealth. The socialist who — morally bankrupt individual who would use any means to achieve his ends.\nHe is willing to teach the views of Saul Alinsky. But what do the rest of us get? No comment. President Barack Obama declined an interview request on the topic of Saul Alinsky during the campaign. No, he doesn&apos;t want to talk about it. He&apos;ll teach it, but he won&apos;t talk about it.\nWell, that doesn&apos;t make sense because, I mean, if you&apos;re a professor who stood at the blackboard and taught Saul Alinsky, you should be an expert on him. You should know. You should know where you stand on Saul Alinsky and his tactics and no American president would accept Saul Alinsky. They would all reject him.\nWell, he knows who he is, because he taught him. So the question remains, is the president of the United States a Saul Alinsky guy? More Marx than Madison? Or is our president more Madison than Marx?\nSee, the media won&apos;t follow up on these questions because the same goes for them. The media is more Marx than Madison. Some love him so much that they get a thrill up their leg when they hear President Obama speak. Chris Matthews said that.\nHe also said that it was, quote, \"My job to make this presidency a success,\" end quote. Well, what does Chris Matthews, the man who loves this president so much, say about Saul Alinsky, a guy who is completely irrelevant, remember? Roll the tape.\nCHRIS MATHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Well, to reach back to one of our heroes from the past, from the &apos;60s, Saul Alinsky, who once said that even though both sides have flaws in their arguments and you can always find something nuanced about your own side you don&apos;t like, and it&apos;s never perfect, you have to act in the end, like there is simple, black-and-white clarity between your side and the other side or you don&apos;t get anything done. I always try to remind myself of Saul Alinsky when I get confused.\nBECK: Yes. By the way, he was talking to the only socialist in the Congress, Bernie Sanders. And that happened two days before Christmas, or maybe it was three days before Christmas.\nMr. Thrill-Up-My-Leg-Over-Obama always tries to remind himself of, quote, \"one of our heroes of the past, Saul Alinsky.\" One of our heroes. I found the keyword there to be \"our,\" Chris Matthews. Many in the media who cheerlead for this president also hold up Saul Alinsky as their hero, the same Saul Alinsky who wants to take from the haves and give to have-nots.\nGee, where did we hear this before? The same Saul Alinsky who will let success determine his morals. The same Saul Alinsky who will use any means possible to achieve his ends.\nLet me give you one more name here. I talked about him before we went on vacation. It&apos;s this guy, Robert Creamer. Remember him? Robert Cream",

Does it fit the professor who knows Saul Alinsky&apos;s extraordinary tactics extraordinarily well? Professor Barack Obama?\nI believe it&apos;s beyond a reasonable doubt. Case closed. I know where the media stands. I know where the elites are in Washington. The question is, where do you stand, America? You must make it clear. You decide. They&apos;re both revolutionaries.

        "prompt": "Impact Wrestling Star On How Chris Jericho Could Benefit The Company - Wrestling Inc.\n\"At this point I wouldn't be shocked because of everything you just read. Canadian-based company, Don Callis, Scott D'Amore, I wouldn't be shocked. Before when he teased years ago coming in I would be like, 'Ah, that's not gonna happen', but now I wouldn't be as shocked. Jericho's doing his own thing, he's going off to New Japan and his cruise and all that kind of stuff. He doesn't really need WWE anymore. He's got his band, all that kind of stuff. So why not for him have a little bit of fun? I've even heard him getting in his last run backstage he'd be be getting heat with somebody because politics, whatever the case may be. He's gonna come to IMPACT and there'd be none of that.\n\"But let me say this, I have no idea if he's coming. I figured those decisions will probably be held really close to Scott, Don, probably Sonjay and Jimmy. Those are probably the only four people that know if he comes. If he doesn't come in or if he comes. But they're not gonna spread that, they're not gonna let that leak out or whatever the case may be. And then the next question is what do they do? Who does he feud with? When does he come? How does he so it? All that kind of stuff which will probably be for future podcasts if he ends up coming to IMPACT.\"\n\"Oh yeah, absolutely. It's business, pretty much. TV is business, right? So the hardest part about TV and all that kind of stuff is getting on network television, okay? That's the hardest part. You look at companies and stuff like that and they have all the talent in the world, it's just hard to get a TV deal. There's only so many spots, so many TV shows. There's more than just wrestling shows going for those spots. It's hard.\n\"Back when we first went to Spike and Rhyno was our champion, in Windsor at a BCW show we had to put the belt back on Jeff Jarrett. Why? Because he was our most recognizable person for us to go onto Spike TV with. Rhyno wasn't. Jeff Jarrett was. And at the time, I think we were just getting the Dudleys. So that was like us getting bigger stars and all that kind of stuff. So yeah definitely use those names as marketing tools and bargaining tools and all those things for bigger contracts, for television or going to a different network or whatever the case may be. So yeah, absolutely.\"\n\"Yeah, you're gonna use Jericho as a bargaining tool. Obviously you look at what networks are bigger, you look at how many viewers potentially can watch Pop, right? Which is less than how many viewers can potentially watch Spike. I always go back to Spike because that's probably the biggest network we've ever been on. At the end of the day, I think any wrestling company would want to be on broadcast television if they were big enough. Not cable, but the ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox type thing, those ones where you only need an antenna to watch it, if wrestling were that big again. I mean that's the goal, right? Or to get on cable shows that are providers for... you know, they're on all the cable packages and that kind of stuff. So yeah, definitely.\n\"If IMPACT can move to a network that has more potential viewers, they're gonna go for it. It'd be stupid not to. You can't build a company and stay stagnant if you didn't. But it's not like I'm saying anything that's edgy or anything because I think Pop knows that like, 'Hey, this company grows, they're probably gonna leave us or unless we give them more money or whatever, maybe they will be the ones that are like flagship show pretty much'. It's like, 'Hey, they're gonna help our network build' and in that case then they lean on us more and then they'd have to pay us more money and all that kind of stuff. Everybody knows it's business. Everybody.\"\n\"I would say 'great'. I've never actually met Chris",

You killed the business!' and all that kind of stuff, or he could be like, 'Hey man, great job getting that move over' and all that kind of stuff or whatever. I mean, I'm all for it. Anything that's gonna help the company build and stuff like that, I've never heard he has a negative reputation, or a bad reputation I should say, and he's already a locker room leader over at WWE when he goes there.

How many of those people would you suspect are loyal, that is planning on sticking with the company? 34! How many of those people would you estimate are headed out the door? 36!\nThese findings from the 2007 Walker Loyalty Report for Loyalty in the Workplace states that just 34% of employees are sticking while another 36% are about to walk. That leaves 30% who either haven’t made up their minds or are just going with the flow.\nShould you be concerned? I think so. If only a third of the people are with you then it means that two-thirds are either on the fence or going against you. No wonder you have difficulty getting things done.\nThe Walker Report measures loyalty five ways: fairness at work, care and concern, trust in employees, and feelings of accomplishment, and daily job satisfaction. Managers can affect all of these factors, but the single most important one may be trust. Trust is an operative driver; it affects the other four. So if you want to boost loyalty, then attacking trust may be the leverage point, but it is one that may be the most difficult to establish.\nDo what you say you will do. Obvious, of course! But how often have you seen a manager make a promise and forget it? It happens everyday. So how can you make certain you follow through? Document it. Let people know what you plan to accomplish. When you finish, let folks know. More importantly, if you are falling short, either due to lack of time or resources, raise your hand – tell people about it. Give them a progress report. Then follow up until you do follow through.\nBack your people when it counts. When a milestone is achieved, the boss needs to share the glory. More especially, he needs to put the team first. That is, talk up their achievements to senior management. Some folks will think this will jeopardize their chances of advancement.

        "prompt": "The future of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, one of Russia’s most important historical sites, is uncertain. The imperial monument in St. Petersburg has served as a state museum for ninety years. But now, city authorities plan to transfer the building to the control of the Russian Orthodox Church, causing a bitter dispute between the people of St. Petersburg, conservationists and clerics.\nOn Jan. 10, St. Petersburg’s governor Georgy Poltavchenko announced that the state would gift the landmark to the church in an agreement which will last 49 years.\nSt. Isaac’s is known for its lavish interiors and golden domes, which provide some of the best views on Russia’s former imperial capital. It took 40 years to build, largely overseen by the repressive reign of Nicholas I and finally finished under Alexander II in 1858. In the 1930s, the Soviets turned the building into an anti-religious museum. But since the fall of the USSR, the UNESCO world heritage has housed a state museum with a permanent exhibition while also hosting religious sermons.\nChurch officials have said that in the West, pointing specifically to Italy and the Vatican, cathedrals are operated by religious authorities. They have also promised that the cathedral will remain open to the public. In a press conference, the spokesman for the Orthodox Church Vladimir Legoida said it plans to scrap the 250 ruble fee to enter St. Isaac’s and pledged to “guarantee access” to it.\nBut opponents of the move doubt that these promises will be kept.\n“It will be destroyed,” says Nikolay Burov, the museum’s current director. He clarifies that nobody will literally destroy the building but that the new management will be unable to cope with its maintenance. “I am a realistic man of the 21st century, I know how the economics of this place work,” says Burov, adding that St. Isaac’s requires constant renovation and employs almost 400 people.\nBurov worries that under the authority of the church, St. Isaac’s will lose its “utilitarian function” as a public building open to the people of St. Petersburg.\nHe is not alone in this opinion—the city did not take the decision well. Over 190,000 people have signed an online petition against the decision. The day after Poltavchenko announced the news, a few hundred people gathered outside the cathedral in a spontaneous protest demanding city authorities retract the decision.\n“St. Isaac’s is a symbol of our city and its fate should be decided by the citizens of St. Petersburg,” says Bogdan Litvin, one of the organisers of the protest. Instead, the decision was made by one person: the governor Poltavchenko.\n“We should solve this issue using direct democracy,” says local pollster Roman Mogilevsky. Protesters, who plan another demonstration on Jan. 28, are demanding a referendum on the fate of the building. But city authorities have already dismissed this idea. St. Petersburg’s ultra conservative vice governor Mikhail Mokretsov called this idea “an exotic way to fulfill federal law,” further angering protesters.\nIt is not the first time controversy around the question of St. Isaac’s ownership has arisen in the city. Burov says this debate goes back 150 years, when the cathedral was first built. In prerevolutionary Russia, the church’s Synod asked the imperial government to transfer St. Isaac’s from the jurisdiction of the interior ministry to the full control of the church—but it repeatedly refused to do so.\nBurov sees echoes of the same debate in today’s Russia.\nOnly last Spring, city authorities rejected a church request to hand over the building on economic grounds. Then, local church authorities grew quiet and did not protest the decision. Yet, less than a year later, the St. Petersburg government appears to have made a U-turn.\n“This could only have come from the Kremlin,” says Andrei Desnitsky, an expert on the Russian Orthodox Church. “It looks like an exchange for a favor,” he adds. Desnitsky believes the timing of the affair is no coincidence. As Russia enters the centenary year of the Russian revolution, the state will be looking to emphasize national unity over rifts. The Kremlin may be looking to stage a show in which it needs church support.\nOne of these shows could be burying the remains of Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria, which were found in an Ural forest, separated from the rest of Russia’s murdered royal family. Funerals for the pair were repeatedly scheduled and repeatedly called off by the church, which does not recognize the remains as authentic despite scientists largely agreeing on the matching DNA. “Burying them could be a strong political signal for the state this year,” says Desnitsky. In order to do so, the Kremlin would require church participation. Gifting St Isaac’s to the Patriarchy could convince it to agree.\nBurov, too, cannot help but draw the parallel to the centenary. “I am a statesman not a revolutionary, but I do not think this is the right way to mark this jubilee,” he says.\nSince the fall of the USSR, the transfer of religious buildings to the church has been ongoing, but the institution’s power as a landlord has been strengthened significantly under Putin. In 2010, the Duma passed a law allowing major state buildings to return to the church. In 2016 alone, 133 buildings were given to the patriarchy and there are thousands more listed as eligible for the",
        "baseline": " same treatment on the official site of Russia’s Federal Agency for State Property.\nThe more property the church gains, the more conservationists fear for its ability to look after the buildings. “I worry that there are not enough voices inside the church who think about how to look after the buildings,” Desnitsky says. Even the burning of scented candles during religious ceremonies damages interiors.\nKonstantin Mikhailov, the head of Russia’s conservationist society Arkhnadzor, calls for calm in the situation. “We need to think of the church as a business,” he says, calling for it to put forward a plan on how it will finance and maintain St Isaac’s. Making the plans for the maintenance of the public cathedral, he warns, should happen before, not after, the takeover. “This is a national treasure and we cannot afford to experiment with it,” says Mikhailov.",

Burov says that the church has not been able to maintain the buildings it has been given. Vladimir Legoida, the church’s spokesman, has admitted that the church has not been able to keep up with the maintenance of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.

        "prompt": "A review of Etsy-preneurship: Everything You Need to Know to Turn Your Handmade Hobby into a Thriving Business, by Jason Malinak.\nJason Malinak's fifth chapter in Etsy-preneurship: Everything You Need to Know to Turn Your Handmade Hobby into a Thriving Business (John Wiley & Sons, $19.95) opens with the allegory of Susan Spendfreely and Megan Moneywise. Over the river and through the Internet woods, boy did my eyes roll.\nTedious and confounding, the 206-page book's useful parts (what Malinak would call \"nuggets\") are obscured by throat-clearers -- empty set-ups that dither until you get to your point. I fall into throat-clearing mode when I'm, you know, speaking. But on the page, they might as well be lethal: accidental death from clinging to the Jane Schaffer method of paragraph-writing. \"Nothing kills your business like wasting time.\" \"Every year, new cameras come out with improved features.\" Pretty soon I'm going to end this sentence and start another one.\nHere's the thing: Malinak and I are in total agreement. Etsy is awesome. The 400,000 vendors on the self-touted \"world's online marketplace for handmade and vintage items\" sell everything from Game of Thrones maps to eco-friendly engagement rings to Jon Stewart onesies. My 10 purchases from Etsy -- eBay's successor and Pinterest's precursor -- include a hand-stamped \"I Read Banned Books\" bracelet.\nMalinak is an accountant, not a writer. He caters to advice seeking customers with eBooks and spreadsheets in a pair of Etsy shops. Last year, Etsy sold $538 million in goods. Piggybacking on such success, authors have turned books about Etsy into a small publishing subcategory. (Starting an Etsy Business for Dummies; Etsy 101: Sell Your Crafts on Etsy, the DIY marketplace for handmade, vintage & crafting supplies; Regretsy: Where DIY Meets WTF, et cetera.) Malinak's CPA background offers a new angle.\nWhile he claims not to be an artist, Malinak takes major creative license with the exclamation point (on one page, I counted five), even wedging one in after the word \"audit.\" Ahem [throat clear], I mean \"audit!\" In a recent essay for The Atlantic's website, Grantland writer Rembert Browne summed up the anti-Malinak approach: \"I would be lying if I described my feelings toward seeing an exclamation point as loathe or not a fan of. The hate in my heart for the misused, overly used piece of punctuation is very real, and I couldn't be prouder, seeing as that it might be the only thing I truly stand for.\" Malinak's exclamation points reminded me of the airplane trick parents use to spoon-feed babies -- watch the birdie while we learn about bookkeeping, taxes and operations.\nSince Malinak's not an Etsy employee, readers miss out on the Etsy origin story (I understand his point of view, but I almost felt -- stupidly -- that Malinak denied one of the founders the chance to write a this-is-how-we-did-it-back-in-2005 book with the titular neologism \"Etsy-preneurship\"). I struggled to determine Malinak's target audience, and also whether the book was well-timed. Initially, the book seemed explicitly meant for crafters who are actively planning an Etsy outpost. However, Malinak's six core strategies apply to the foundation all businesses. Achieving top positions in an Etsy search function is exactly like navigating the world of search engine optimization to get your website a higher Google ranking.

Every type of protocol is explained step-by-step. (Etsy, PayPal, shipping fees.)

Today&apos;s drop extends a more than 12% decline yesterday given the market&apos;s initial reaction to the news.\nFor perspective, I noted yesterday that even though Criteo has made progress in its transformation to a multiproduct platform in recent quarters, this situation partly echoes Criteo&apos;s plunge in late 2017 after Apple rolled out new Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) technology for its iOS platform and Safari Web browser.\nSure enough, this morning KeyBanc Analyst Andy Hargreaves argued that while \"incentives and antitrust issues make a full ITP-like solution in Chrome very unlikely, ... we will not be able to disprove the bear case until Google provides more clarity on its plans, which is likely to create an overhang on CRTO that we do not expect to ease in the near term.\"\nMeanwhile, SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton worried not only that Chrome may represent around half of Criteo&apos;s current revenue, but also that Google&apos;s move could encourage other smaller",

It cleared the panel in a 28-20 party-line vote.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi supports the legislation and plans to bring it to an eventual vote in the full Democratic-held chamber. If the House passes the bill, it would mark the most significant step toward raising the federal minimum wage since 2009, the last time the pay floor increased. The U.S. currently has a $7.25 minimum wage.\nThe legislation has only a slim chance of becoming law. Republicans in the GOP-held Senate — like their colleagues in the House — will likely oppose it. The White House has also trashed the idea of hiking the federal wage floor, though President Donald Trump has not weighed in recently himself.\nDemocrats see the measure as a way to cast themselves as the better party for working Americans ahead of key 2020 presidential and congressional elections. They have cast Republicans as out of touch — particularly through criticizing the GOP tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans.\nDemocrats say the legislation would give nearly 40 million American workers a raise. They argue the increase will help laborers better keep up with rising costs of living, and boost the economy by giving those workers more money to spend. Under the bill, the pay floor would rise to $15 per hour in 2024 and would continue to climb in line with median wage growth.\n\"We now have an opportunity – and a responsibility – to restore the value of the minimum wage, lift millions of hardworking people out of poverty, and boost the economy in Main Street America,\" Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said in opening a bill markup hearing Wednesday.\nRepublicans have argued the plan would hurt small-business owners by increasing costs. It would force them to cut positions and hours for low-wage workers and potentially increase automation, critics contend.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business organization in the nation, has also lined up against the legislation.\n\"Going from a $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage to a $15 an hour minimum wage is, at best, a foolish policy proposal,\" committee ranking member Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said Wednesday. \"At worst, it's an intentionally dishonest political stunt that promises bigger paychecks to hardworking Americans when in reality it would result in significant job losses for millions of hourly workers around the country.\"\nThe debate over a $15 per hour federal minimum wage comes as states and cities around the country have increasingly embraced",

Twenty-nine states currently have higher minimum wages than the federal level, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nSome critics of a federal minimum wage hike have argued states should decide appropriate pay floors based on cost of living.

One of those inmates shares his story.\nMy name is Candido Santiago. I served a 10-year prison sentence at North Central Correctional Institution in Massachusetts for selling cocaine and was released last year.\nIn the final year of my sentence, I was one of the first inmates to sign up for a dog-training program run by Correctional Officer Reagan, which was supported by an organization called Don’t Throw Us Away. The program partners inmates with dogs rescued from Southern kill shelters where they in turn care for and help rehabilitate the dogs over the course of eight weeks, caring for its every need. I rehabilitated, trained, loved, and cared for six stray dogs over the course of that year. These dogs had experienced tough pasts, like myself and the other inmates. The dogs had been abandoned, neglected, or abused—sometimes all three. From the start, I made it a point to show each dog compassion and to earn their trust. I decided to participate because I am a dog lover and wanted the opportunity to have a companion while I was in prison, as well as learn how to train a dog.\nMy experience working with dogs in prison had a huge impact on my life. At times during my sentence, I was really lonely and no one visited me. It was very tough. I once sent myself a card in the mail with my address on it just so I would have a letter to look forward to receiving. These dogs always lent me a non-judgmental ear when I talked to them, which is hard to find in an environment like prison. They were the ultimate companions. Each dog I was responsible for provided me love, trust, confidence, and a purpose.\nThere was one dog in particular, a chihuahua named Sam, which really needed a lot of attention, love, and patience from me. When he first arrived, Sam wouldn’t come out of his crate at all. Let me tell you, it’s not easy building a bond with a dog when they are nervous, shaking, and won’t come out of their crate. So every day I crawled halfway into his crate to let him know I was there for him and I wasn’t going to hurt him. Eventually, Sam started to trust me and I didn’t have to crawl into his crate anymore! During my time with these dogs, I developed a bond with all of them and I cried when each of them left to go to their new home. It was bittersweet but I knew they were going to a much better place than prison, that’s for sure!\nI was able to gain momentum in bettering my sense of self-worth from all of the positive feelings the dogs gave me, which carried over as I was preparing to leave prison and re-enter society.\nThe dogs helped us inmates become closer as well, as evidenced by members from rival gangs being able to find a common ground in the program. There were two gang members representing different colors who wouldn’t speak to each other. At one point, they were even on the verge of fighting. When the program came, it took a little bit of time, but bonding over the dogs eventually led to a friendship between both men.\nCurrently, I am employed at a bakery that makes éclairs, where I work 12-hour shifts on the assembly line.

Kelly was hanged in 1880 for crimes that ranged from robberies to killings to cattle theft. His remains were buried in a Melbourne jail, but exhumed for transfer to another nearby prison in 1929, at which point they were looted and Kelly’s skull disappeared. The remains were again exhumed in 2009 after a skull claimed to be Kelly’s was presented to officials.\nCalled a “cold-blooded murderer” by some and celebrated as “a folk hero” by others, Kelly led a small gang that robbed banks, incited the Irish-Australian population to revolt, burned an entire town’s mortgage deeds and dictated a notable letter protesting the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police",

        "prompt": "The senatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the Ekiti Central senatorial district, Barrister Obafemi Adewale, has alleged that some hoodlums loyal to the All Progressives Congress (APC), who allegedly followed the convoy of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo into the state on Monday vandalised his campaign materials and removed others.\nObafemi, who is former Secretary-General of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and ex-Attorney- General of Ekiti State, also described the alleged destruction of his campaign materials as a rude shock to his party and unwholesome development against democratic precedents.\nHis words: “We are having this press briefing because of the significance that we attach to the latest development that occurred in the state, particularly in Ado Ekiti on Monday. In furtherance of our campaign for the February 16 polls, we have mounted our campaign materials all over the state just like any other candidate; it was, however, a rude shock to us and for me particularly as a senatorial candidate of PDP in Ekiti Central to wake up on Monday morning to the ugly acts of some undemocratic forces who went all over the state to vandalise our campaign materials and remove many of them.\n“We found out that only the materials for me and other candidates of the PDP were so vandalised by those hoodlums. We also observed that none of the materials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was so vandalised; this unequivocally establishes the fact that it was done by either member of APC or hoodlums, criminals sympathetic to APC; we noted in particular, one of our billboards in front of Eyitayo estate on Iworoko Road, Ado Ekiti, was vandalised by miscreants who were within the convoy of the VP, and there are eyewitnesses to this development. It is very clear that this was done by the APC and we are worried by the fact that the ruling APC is displaying intolerance to the opposition in the state.\n“Maybe they wanted to give an impression to the VP that they are the only one on ground here; we want the world to know that the stronghold of PDP is Ekiti Central senatorial district; this is a PDP state and it has been demonstrated by the results of past polls in the state since 2003.\n“The democratic space is been polluted and shrunk by the activities of these undemocratic elements in the state. We demand peaceful, free and fair polls not only in Ekiti but in the nation. It is the only way we can guarantee true democracy; what happened in Ekiti on Monday if not checked was a message that the opposition cannot operate freely in the state but we refuse to be intimidated. I urge my supporters not to remain undaunted, determined and hold out firmly against oppression, intimidation and undemocratic forces; Nigeria is a great country and Ekiti is a land of honour; we want to behave ourselves honourably and we plead with the ruling party to allow peace to reign in the state. One of the hallmarks of democracy is a periodic change in administration through democratic elections; this election cannot be considered democratic if the ruling party is not allowing the opposition to operate freely.\n“The presidential candidate of the PDP Atiku Abubabar visited Ekiti last week and PDP members did not vandalise campaign materials of APC or other parties because Atiku was in town; what would APC have lost if they allowed the VP to know that there are other parties campaigning in Ekiti. I tell you, the highest form of deceit is self-deceit; what APC is trying to do is to give a false impression that they are the only one on the ground, but by the results of the coming polls, we will show them",

        "prompt": "When buying a commercial app or working with a vendor to create one from scratch, organizations are specifying too many requirements, including ones that are non-essential or cosmetic. According to one Info-Tech Research Group Ltd. consultant, the key to successfully selecting a vendor for packaged or custom applications is to identify core requirements quickly and keep the initial selection team small.\n“If you have a team of more than five people who are commissioned with finding the right solution and requirements, you’re probably wasting a lot of effort,” said Andy Woyzbun, lead analyst at London, Ont.-based research and consultant firm. Especially for customized projects, design by large committee almost never works, he added.\nWhile some organizations gather staff from across multiple departments to work through all aspects of a project — from the initial requirements gather project through to vendor selection — Woyzbun warned that this practice will cause most companies to miss the essentials.\n“Don’t sweat the details until you’re well into the development process,” he advised, adding that it’s a far better strategy to select a vendor or develop a set of key project requirements without wasting too much staff time outside of the initial development team.\nBringing in employees from various departments is great to validate what’s been chosen and what features can be added on top of the core functionality of an application, he said.\nFor example, when building out a payroll system, some employees might want to see customizable fields and fonts show up on their pay stubs. While this is something that should be taken into consideration for the latter stages of the project, the focus of the payroll system needs to be on its core features.\n“Don’t worry about the colours of the walls before you’ve bought the house,” Woyzbun said, adding that the companies he’s worked with tend to “overcook” their requirements and the vendor selection process in general. This is especially true on large ERP, CRM, or business intelligence initiatives, he said.\nThe organizations that keep their requirements teams small and zero in on key objections will waste the least money and get a usable product turned around quicker, Woyzbun said.\nThis advice comes just one month after New Castle, Del.-based software development consultancy IAG Consulting found that the average North American enterprise wastes 33 per cent of their budget on app projects due to",

        "prompt": "Without robust worker protections built in to single-payer legislation, health-care workers will continue to be undervalued.\nIf you get a check-up at any health clinic in America today, you may have no idea how much it will cost, but two things are virtually certain: The bill will be too high, and the nurse who saw you will be paid too little. The sickening paradox at the root of the American health-care system is that, despite skyrocketing costs for patients, front-line workers like medical assistants and home-care aides are shockingly underpaid—while insurers and health-care corporations pocket the difference. The health-care-reform debate in Washington is finally starting to grapple with the equity gap in the health system for consumers, and momentum is gaining for a fairer government-run single-payer system. Yet, for all the promise of the “Medicare for All” proposal, there’s surprisingly little discussion on how an overhaul of our health-care system would affect the people delivering our care.\nThe new single-payer legislation in Congress, alongside parallel state-level proposals, promise free care for all. But according to Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), however services are financed, hospital-based institutions are set to consolidate and downsize, and workers will be left with more work for less pay.\nCould health-care reform fix the imbalance? By centralizing health-care finance and eliminating private insurance, single payer would protect consumers from corporate profit motives, since all providers would by definition be publicly funded and managed. However, the single-payer proposals currently before Congress include scant detail on labor standards. So, beyond the cost of care for patients, could a better-regulated system also provide a living wage and a union? Would home-care workers get a $15 minimum wage or paid parental leave under Medicare for All? Whether your clinic is funded through an insurance company or a Medicare-for-All-type government-run plan, many workers might end up with a painful pay cut without additional protections for health-care labor.\nUnder current workforce trends, there has been an increase in black workers in outpatient facilities, a doubling of Latino workers, and a more than 80 percent increase in Asian and other workers, with women driving the job growth across sectors. From 2005 to 2015, black men’s earnings sank by more than 12 percent, driven by declining wages for medical technicians and assistants. Female technicians and professional staff in outpatient facilities, while continuing to earn less than male coworkers across the board—with wage gaps of about 8 to 24 percent—earn substantially less than their in-hospital female peers. Even mostly college-educated social- service workers in outpatient centers earn less than $38,000 a year, less than what a unionized nurse might earn in a hospital.\nHowever, given the relative strength of public-sector unions—which, as state-based entities, would presumably be free of union-busting corporate monopolies—a single-payer system could help expand union representation, so that outpatient staff could keep up with the incomes of their counterparts at large medical institutions.\nThis is where organized labor could play a critical role in health-care restructuring: Collective bargaining could ensure fair, stable pay scales and working conditions. There have been strong unionization drives in health care in recent years; for instance, the SEIU has campaigned in several states to provide representation to home",

Still, despite some expanded federal labor protections under Obama, home-care workers overall remain irrationally underpaid, working under high-stress conditions for only about $10 an hour, often without adequate health benefits themselves. These workers, under any management system, will need stronger labor standards combined with a culture shift in the health-care industry that fairly values a labor force that is fueled by women of color and immigrants.\nIn the coming years, the health-care system is poised to restructure to respond to our communities’ diversifying needs. If this system is going to be sustainable for the whole community, the workforce will need an upgrade too. Moving toward an integrated, universalized model of care for all should also integrate labor, so the state, unions, and communities ensure that every worker is taken care of.",

        "prompt": "100 years after the Somme: \"We ain't a-marching\"\nI AM part of the first generation of our species in a thousand years that has never been asked by my government to kill people.\nAt 7.30 one century ago this morning, Britain launched the first of its many grand offensives of the Great War, aiming to dislodge German troops from a ridge line on the Somme.\nThe young men of Newfoundland were called on at 8.45 to reinforce the rest of their 87th Infantry Brigade, stuck on the wire in no-man's land. It was a blunder. German crossfire cut them to shreds, massacring rank upon rank even as they rose from their trenches.\nPrivate James McGrath, wounded in three places, was left in no man's land for 17 hours. Another 324 other men were left there, dead.\nNinety percent of the unit were hit; of all the regiments that went into battle that day, the Newfoundlanders suffered the second worst casualty rate.\nIt took 20 minutes to wipe out the Newfoundland Army. The local paper in Newfoundland advertised \"Extra: Lengthy Casualty Lists\" on July 5 but families were in the dark about their sons' fate for years to come.\nAnd the tiny country couldn't bear their loss; they lost so many young men the country agreed to be annexed by Canada a few years later. July 1 is Canada Day everywhere except Newfoundland, where the national holiday is not celebrated. Instead, today is Memorial Day.\nA total of 57,000 English speaking men were killed or wounded that day, a century ago, plus tens of thousands of Germans, French and colonial troops. The battle continued for five more months and the war for two more years.\nOne Australian, simply known as Tank Stand Tommy was deployed to the tiny fortification in Pozieres they called Gibraltar in the middle of July.\nIt's a ruin nowadays, but you get a sense of the scale of the place from the entrance, which is less than five foot high, concrete and incredibly claustrophobic. He'd have bent to walk under the tight ceilings, you'd imagine.\nOver the course of a week, the Germans dropped tens of thousands of tonnes of TNT on the town around him, killing or wounding 7000 Australians: a direct hit would have wrecked the place.\nThough he survived the fight, Tommy could never live indoors again. He died a broken man years later, frozen to death under a rural water tower, the town drunk. He was likely not given back pay he was owed and his pension was probably confiscated by the state. He was Indigenous, and no less a casualty than if he'd been shot.\nSergeant John Ryan, 47th Australian Infantry Battalion, was overrun by a huge German offensive at Dernancourt, outnumbered eight to one.\nHe left three young sons and a wife who allegedly fell apart at the news; his sister meanwhile sued for their custody and his pay. The news was false. He was in a prison camp in Bavaria. Even when it does not kill, war can tear families apart.\nMost were not even that lucky; his unit suffered 225% casualties over two years. That is, it was wiped out, replaced, wiped out and replaced.\nOther units lost many more. Three hundred thousand Australians went to France or Gallipoli. Half of them came home wounded, crippled, maimed, legless, armless, blind or insane. Sixty thousand never came home.\nThe Australian Army took the highest casualty rate of any in the entire war - except New Zealand's.\nThis wasn't even unusual, historically speaking. There was a terrible war before the Great one, and another after it. For millions of humans throughout history, war was their very first adult experience - straight from the farm or the school and marched directly into the phalanxes or the tercios or the battalions and were carried thence directly into coffins, never to grow old.\nMillions of virgins died or were killed before graduating school. Hundreds of millions of mothers, widows, sisters, brothers, sons and fathers waited for years to be told that the government regrets to inform you that your son has been blown into red mist for your country. Dulce et decorum est is an old lie, as old as civilisation.\nAnd yet they were willing to do this. It's something you read again and again in diaries and memoirs: willingness to risk or sacrifice life and limb to end their need to do so.\nAnd they have been, more or less successful: that sort of thing doesn't really happen these days.

We have more or less slain the great dragon, the worst demons of our nature have been overcome by the angels of it.\nI see this as the great success of the 20th century, far greater than landing on the moon. It means I will never have a white unnamed grave and I will never not be grateful for that.\nToday is also a reminder of the duty of our generation to make sure they stay that way.\nCredits to Queensland Theatre Company for the Indigenous soldier's anecdote, and to Battle Scarred by Craig Deayton for the married man's.",

        "prompt": "NEW YORK (AP) — In filing for bankruptcy, Toys R Us joins a list of dozens of store chains that have done so already this year as online leader Amazon increasingly exerts its influence over a huge part of the retailing world.\nThe toy chain, hobbled by $5 billion in debt and more intense competition, filed for protection from its creditors ahead of the key holiday season. Like so many retailers that find it harder to co-exist with Amazon, analysts say Toys R Us needs to improve its online services and offering special experiences in the stores.\nFor Toys R Us, that might be game demonstrations or hosting birthday parties. It says it’ll keep its 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores open, and keep serving customers while in bankruptcy. Still, the chain faces hurdles — price is a big issue for shoppers, and Toys R Us acknowledges that it can’t compete there.\n“We will go to Toys R Us to check out the current toys, and while we are at the store, we will be looking up prices on the phone on Walmart.com and Amazon,” said Randy Watson of Fort Worth, Texas.\nHe used to pick up items at Toys R Us for his kids. But for his grandchildren, he uses the store to see what’s available and then shops elsewhere to get lower prices.\nThe bankruptcies of nearly three dozen retailers since the beginning of the year — many of them very small companies, but also well-known names like Payless Shoe Source, Gymboree Corp. and True Religion jeans — has resulted in job losses and store closings. Toys R Us didn’t say if it would trim its workforce of nearly 65,000 employees worldwide.\nCredit Suisse believes that there could be 8,640 store closings this year, which would surpass the 2008 peak of 6,200. In 2008, the number of bankruptcies was at a historic high of 569, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmazon, meanwhile, has been using its $99-a year-Prime Membership as a way to gain fierce shopper loyalty as it adds more perks like same-day delivery Amazon Now for a growing number of markets. It’s also making partnerships with brands like Sears and Kohl’s, and now has hundreds of Whole Foods stores that it could use as distribution points.\nToys R Us was a major force in toy retailing in the 1980s and early 1990s, and was one of the first of the “category killers” — retailers that focused on one merchandising category and offered low prices. That combination hurt mom-and pop shops that couldn’t compete on breadth of inventory or price.\nBut like its peers, the now-defunct Sports Authority, Borders and Circuit City, Toys R Us started losing shoppers to discounters like Walmart and Target, and then to Amazon.\nGlobalData Retail estimates that about 13.7 percent of toy sales were made online in 2016, up from 6.5 percent five years ago. And Toys R Us has also been hurt by children shifting to mobile devices as playthings.\nBut the toy industry still needs Toys R Us, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of the toy review website TTPM. He cites the fact that it sells toys all year, rather than just at the holidays, and has helped launch toy crazes such as ZhuZhu Pets during the downturn.\n“If toy companies lost Toys R Us, it would be a hardship for a lot of companies,” said Silver.\nToys R Us has also struggled with debt since private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005.

        "prompt": "In 2010 the FSB adopted Principles for Reducing Reliance on Credit Rating Agency (CRA) Ratings. In 2012, the FSB set out a roadmap implement those principles and reduce mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings in standards, laws and regulations, which if implemented would remove mandatory use of credit ratings. The 2014 peer review of national authorities' implementation of the 2010 principles found that more could be done to address gaps in individual action plans.\nCRA assessments have a strong impact on asset allocation, such as for pension funds that have internal guidelines based on ratings. Because of this impact on demand, ratings also impact the interest rate borrowers pay for obtaining financing. Ratings are also written into certain prudential regulations. The Basel II framework hard-coded ratings into the capital requirements, while the Basel III framework allows banks to determine the risk weights for capital requirements on the basis of CRAs’ evaluations. Credit ratings are also used by central banks in the lending eligibility policies and foreign exchange reserves management, and provide a guideline for investment funds’ strategies. As part of efforts to implement the 2010 principles, In the United States, for example, financial regulators replaced mandatory use of credit ratings with alternative approaches that include the use of definitions, regulatory models, and evaluation by third parties, but as noted above, CRA ratings are still allowed to be used by banks in their internal risk models.\nThe FSB has no plans to conduct additional peer reviews of CRAs. Going forward national level reviews will be the main follow-up.

This would complement the above agreement, which focuses on analysing risks from these factors to companies’ businesses, but does not incorporate analysis of the impact of company actions.

        "prompt": "After years in the making, the village's conversion to city water should take place sometime next year.\nCOSHOCTON - The Coshocton city and the Village of West Lafayette councils have approved a deal for the city to sell water and water services to the village.\nCoshocton City Council members voted 5 to 0 in approving the agreement. Councilman Roger Moore was absent, but had previously expressed his support for the project. Councilman Tom Grier also voiced his support, but abstained from voting as he was the village administrator for West Lafayette when talks first began a couple years ago. Voting yes were Mike Gross, Chad Johnson, Jackie Salmans, Brad Fuller and Glenn Mishler.\nWest Lafayette Council approved the contract by a vote of 4 to 3 with Mayor Stephen Bordenkircher casting the tie breaking vote. Ron Lusk, Craig Bordenkircher and Christie Maurer voted for the deal. Timothy Cheney, Charles Wheeler and Bo Fortune voted against it. Those voting to the negative have long said they were against the village giving up direct rights to its water utility. Those who have supported it have long said it would offer better quality water at a cheaper rate to customers while providing loan and grant funding for needed infrastructure improvements.\nThe tentative schedule is for all funding applications and engineer drawings to be finalized by end of the year. Groundbreaking for the project would be early next year and conversion to city water for the village to take place later in 2020. An exact date has not been set.\nThe project will have the city running waterlines to the village and tie into existing infrastructure. Coshocton would then provide water and maintain services for the village's approximate 900 customers. The total project is estimated at $6.6 million. The city would not start receiving fees from customers until it starts providing the water.\nThe contract has the city taking ownership of the village water system, not including the wellfields. Items include underground pipes, hydrants, valves, meters and other appurtenances, water treatment plant, equipment, water storage facilities and associated real estate interests. The village would abandon its wellfield as it would no longer be needed.\nAbout 22,000 feet of 12-inch waterlines will connect the city water system to the village water treatment plant. Additionally, the project will see 13,000 feet of substandard waterlines replaced inside the village and extending up to 10,600 feet of 6-inch and 8-inch diameter waterlines to select areas of the village.\nVillage water users will not be subject to the current debt reduction charge city water customers have on their bills of $9.75 per month. Village residents will receive the inside city rate and outside the village customers will receive the outside city rate. Currently, the inside rate is $16.79 per month for a minimum user and the outside rate is 1.5 times that. The rate could go up by the time of activation, but the contract states there will be no rate increase for village water customers within the first 12 months after services from the city starts. The city will be responsible for invoicing and collecting fees.\nThe contract establishes the creation of an advisory committee to advise the city regarding water system improvements and rates. It will be comprised of the village administrator, a member of village council, a member of the Lafayette Township and Tuscarawas Township trustees, the city utilities director and a person appointed by the city mayor.\nThe city has recently completed a waterline expansion to Hillsdale Drive and is working on another along County Road 10.

        "prompt": "Slashing $100 billion: What's first to go?\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Incoming House Speaker John Boehner has made it very clear: When he takes control of the House, slashing the federal budget by $100 billion will be priority number one.\nRepublicans view their midterm electoral victory as a mandate to cut spending, and cutting $100 billion from a $3 trillion federal budget sounds like a reasonable goal.\nBut GOP leaders say they will focus only on non-security discretionary spending, and won't slash funding for defense, Social Security or Medicare.\nThat makes their task a lot harder.\nCutting non-security discretionary funds by $100 billion means a 21% annual reduction in the part of the budget that includes funding for education, health and human services and housing and urban development, among other things, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\nIn other words, the sacred cows of domestic Democratic policy.\nAsked which programs will be cut to get to the $100 billion target, Boehner did not offer specifics.\n\"But I will tell you,\" he told reporters earlier this month. \"We are going to cut spending.\"\nRepublicans point out they have already voted to ban earmarks -- money appropriated by a member of Congress for a special project -- within their own caucus.\nThe problem is that earmarks aren't additional spending -- they're a portion of the total amount lawmakers have agreed to spend for a given year.\nStill, Boehner already has his starting point picked out: reducing Congress' own budget.\n\"We'll start first by cutting our own budget. It will be one of our first votes,\" Boehner said earlier this month. But the savings available there are paltry. The total budget for the legislative branch was $4.7 billion in 2009.\nThat leaves the GOP with a lot of ground to make up.\nRepublicans offered some clues as to how they might cut discretionary spending in the party's Pledge to America document and the YouCut program introduced earlier this year.\nThe Pledge to America is short on specifics. Among its proposals: cap discretionary spending, freeze hiring of federal workers and cancel unspent stimulus funds.\n\"I think getting control of the discretionary accounts is a great first step,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a leading Republican economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe YouCut program actually put some GOP ideas to the test. During the last Congress, Republicans took 14 ideas to cut the budget and brought the items to a vote in the House. If they had all passed, more than $120 billion would have been cut from the budget.\nProblem: Not one measure passed.\nIt's unclear how much easier it will get. In 2011, Republicans will control the House, but they will still face a slight Democratic majority in the Senate and, of course, Obama in the White House.\n\"The president is still the one setting the agenda,\" said Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum.\nBoehner wants to start cutting right away, saying that Republicans want to roll back discretionary spending to 2008 levels as \"soon as possible.\"\nDemocrats, knowing the fight was ahead, tried",

        "prompt": "A new scientific report supports the theory that the 1692 witch trials in Salem, Mass., may have followed the widespread consumption of a poisonous fungus similar to lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD.\nNineteen women and men were hanged as witches after they, or children in their presence, acted as if ''Satan were loosed in Salem,'' according to descriptions by colonists at the time.\nA report in the current issue of American Scientist suggests that the aberrant behavior of the adults and children, which included convulsions and hallucinations, probably was brought on by ergot, a fungus that grows on rye in cool, damp weather.\nWhen eaten, the fungus can cause symptoms, especially in children, that are said to resemble behavior that the early colonists attributed to witchcraft.\nThe ergot theory was first suggested six years ago in an article in the journal Science. But soon after the Science article was published, a long analysis in the same journal dismissed the explanation as improbable.\nIn the latest report, a historian, Mary K. Matossian, an associate professor at the University of Maryland, concludes that the original proposal was probably correct. Dr. Matossian, who has been studying the effects of mold poisoning on social behavior, based her report on an analysis of court transcripts, climate indicators, diaries and other records of the 1692 witchcraft episodes in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\nDr. Matossian writes that the trials of 1692 were ''the worst outbreak of witch persecution in American history.'' When Governor Phips of Massachusetts ordered a general reprieve the following spring, about 150 accused witches were released.\nThe idea that ergot was to blame was originally proposed by Linda R. Caporael, a graduate student in psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She argued that symptoms displayed by the children thought to be bewitched - fits and complaints of being pricked or bitten, for example -were typical of ergotism.\nThe rebuttal, by Nicholas P. Spanos and Jack Gottlieb, psychologists at Carleton University in Ottawa, noted that the children did not report some symptoms typical of ergot poisoning. Among them were nausea and vomiting, followed by ravenous hunger.\nThe witchcraft affair, she adds, ''may have been part of a largely unrecognized American health problem.'' Occasional cold, damp periods in coastal lowlands, she believes, allowed rye to become infected with ergot.\nAmong the symptoms of severe ergotism is ''formication,'' a feeling that ants are crawling under the skin. The victim may also suffer coldness of the extremities and spasms of limbs, tongue and facial muscles. In severe cases, epileptic seizures, partial paralysis and coma are followed by death.\n''Animals suffering from convulsive ergotism may behave wildly, make loud,",

They may not have reported other symptoms such as nausea because those were not expected in witchcraft victims.\nIn the American colonies at that time, according to Dr. Matossian, rye bread was still a dietary staple and the crop was vulnerable to ergot. From widths of tree rings formed during that period, she found, the growing season in eastern New England was abnormally cool in 1690, 1691 and 1692.\nDiaries kept in Boston during the intervening winters showed they were ''very cold.''

The trials ended in the fall, when the weather became warmer and drier.\nThe ergot theory is also supported by the fact that the Salem witchcraft trials were preceded by a similar outbreak in Connecticut, she says.

Some historians have suggested that the trials were a symptom of the social and economic turmoil of the time. Others have suggested that the accused witches were simply scapegoats for the misfortunes of the community.\nThe report by Dr. Matossian, who is also a research associate at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, is based on an analysis of the weather in the New England area in 1692.

Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are, in comparison, spectacular in every way.\nMind you I am not a casino player, and I assume that the gambling experience, time at the tables or working slot machines, is pretty comparable at all three casinos.\nBut in most other respects — dining, entertainment and shopping opportunities — the reservation casinos are remarkably more interesting.

The elegant casino facades almost mock the extensive blight that stares back.\nIt's like showing up in a dive bar wearing a tuxedo.\nThe concept, a new and interesting one in casino design, was that there would be a natural flow between the city and the casino, that stores and restaurants of the casino would face the street, drawing in city passers-by, and casinogoers would drift outside to the sidewalks and merge into the urban experience.\nIt's not working, at least not yet. The people I saw trudging by on their way to the bus stop didn't seem interested in the posted menu for the casino steakhouse, with entrée prices breaking the $30 mark.

But what are you, some sort of plebe? Of course not. You need your Bentley done to your specs. And they'll do that for you. For a price.\nIn the rest of the world, Bentley's customers are really into personalization. They'll have Bentley build a car that fits their exact spec, and they're ok waiting a little bit for it.\nBut America is a grab and go sort of society. We eat on the go, we're always on our phones, and when we go to a car dealer, we tend to just buy the car on the lot that's closest to what we want.\nThat stands true for pretty much every brand, even Bentley and Rolls-Royce. People go to a dealer, see a black Continental GT with most of the options they want and decide \"that'll do.\" It seems hard to believe that a multi-millionaire that can be so discerning in all the other parts of their life would just settle when it comes to a car.\nSo Bentley is taking a page out of the rest of the world's book and pushing it's bespoke program here in the US. And there's really no reason not to do it, unless you need a Bentley RIGHT NOW.\nWhat bespoke does is tailor the car to your exact taste. In the case of this Bentley Flying Spur, it has an outrageous blue called Kingfisher on the outside, which isn't close to subtle. Inside there are two hides (colors of leather, to you non-patricians), one called Portland and the other called Porpoise. It has 21 inch wheels, red calipers, special wood, and more.\nThe look is, in short, \"the business.\"\nAnd as a chauffeured car for a bachelor, it rocks. The interior is subdued but the exterior color is outrageous. Everywhere we went we had people asking if it was our car and what it was. We also had people glaring at a bunch of 20-somethings getting out of a bright blue Bentley, wondering what they'd done so wrong in life/what we've done so right.\nThere also is no better way to transport a hungover groom-to-be than in the backseat of a quiet, comfortable, opulent, and rich Bentley. Mainly because he can nurse that hangover by controlling the radio, cooling his seats, getting a massage, and acting like the member of the aristocracy that he isn't. After what we made him drink that night (photos were not taken for a reason), the least we could do was politely coddle him the next morning.\nWhat isn't bespoke is the powerplant, which is still the 616 horsepower W12, an engine that is smooth and silky, but not nearly as evocative or fun as the V8 power that is now offered in the Continental and Flying Spur. But the engine isn't supposed to be in the foreground of the W12 powered offerings,",

We wanted to be coddled, to relax off the mix of liquor or beer that was go juice in college but a death sentence just a little bit later in life.\nWas it the perfect car for the trip? Pretty much. Would it have been better in a more boring color? Not really. In a world where Bentley's are becoming more common, do you really want to come across one that's exactly the same as yours?\nNo. You want to be the only person with that car.

        "prompt": "Sidhu was sentenced to eight years in prison today, for his part in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash in April of last year.\nThe truck driver who caused the deadly Humboldt Broncos bus crash a year ago was sentenced to eight years in prison Friday in a Melfort, Sask., court.\nJaskirat Singh Sidhu, 30, pleaded guilty in January to 29 counts of dangerous driving causing death or bodily injury. Sidhu lived in Calgary and was working for a Calgary-based trucking company at the time of the crash.\nJudge Inez Cardinal expressed empathy for the victims' families as she read out her sentencing decision.\nI approach this matter with the recognition that no sentence I impose will make the victims or families whole again or ease the suffering they endure. Nothing can turn back the clock and return the victims, the families, or Mr. Sidhu to the place they were before this tragedy unfolded.\nThis collision was avoidable. Jaskirat Singh Sidhu was solely responsible for this collision as evidenced by the forensic accident report. He missed key indicators of an approaching intersection, and his prolonged inattention resulted in the deaths of sixteen people and caused bodily harm to thirteen others.\nI accept that Mr. Sidhu did not deliberately drive through the intersection in the sense that he was trying to meet a deadline or that he was running late. However, the focus cannot simply be upon what occurred at the intersection. I must consider everything that led up to his driving through the intersection and the resulting catastrophic collision.\nAs he approached the intersection, Mr. Sidhu had a clear view of the scene in front of him. Nothing was blocking his view as the trees in the south-east quadrant were not an issue. However, he failed to take note of the approaching intersection, the approaching bus, or the five signs indicating an intersection with a stop sign was ahead. Had he done so, he should have made the conscious decision to start adjusting his driving so as to do what was required in the immediate future - to bring his large, heavy rig to a complete stop at the intersection.\nDespite its large size and weight, the semi-tractor and trailers could be brought to a stop in a short distance. Calculations were done to determine the \"distance to skid\" in a panic braking situation, based on the perception-reaction time of 1.5 seconds for a sober, rested driver (Report, page 44). This showed that at 86 km/h Mr. Sidhu could have stopped his rig in 99.61 meters. At 96 km/h, in a panic braking situation, the unit could have been brought to a stop in 119.10 meters.\nUsing these calculations, and as illustrated by the chart at page 43 of the Report, Mr. Sidhu had ample time to react - over 400 meters and nearly 15 to 17 seconds – as he approached the intersection, had he been paying attention. As noted at page 44 of the Report, had he been travelling at 86 km/h, and only noticed the sign \"Highway 35 South/Highway 335 West/Highway 35 North\" immediately before the stop sign, and reacted by making a threshold braking application, the collision would not have occurred. This fourth sign was 104.3 meters east of the stop sign so the semi would have skidded to a stop before reaching the stop sign. Even if the semi was traveling at a speed of 96 km/h, it would have skidded past the stop sign, and the impact would have been narrowly, but completely, avoided.\nThe semi-tractor unit with its \"Super B\" configuration was a huge, heavy, and deadly vehicle. It was made even more so by an inexperienced operator in unfamiliar territory who was not giving his full attention to the road ahead of him. He continued past the stop sign without any attempt at braking or evasive action. His large unit straddled both lanes of the highway and left no avenue of escape for the bus.\nIt is baffling, and incomprehensible, that a professional driver, even one with little experience, could miss so many markers over such a long distance. His inattention displays risky behaviour given he saw the signs but they did not register because he continued to focus on the trailers behind him.\nI find Mr. Sidhu's moral blameworthiness to be high, especially considering his prolonged inattentiveness while operating a large, loaded semi and the tragic consequences that flowed from his actions. These offences require a strong message of deterrence and denunciation be sent to ensure Mr. Sidhu never operates a vehicle in such a dangerous manner, and that others, especially operators of large vehicles, understand that the dangerous operation of a motor vehicle will result in lengthy sentences of imprisonment.\nSomehow we must stop this carnage on our highways. It should not take an event such as this to make people realize that operating a motor vehicle requires the full attention of the driver. Stop signs must be obeyed and everyone, regardless of what type of motor vehicle they are operating, must come to a complete stop before proceeding. As is apparent in this case and the cases noted, seconds matter. Attention to the road matters.\nArriving at a just and appropriate sanction requires a balancing of the relevant principles of sentencing, keeping in mind the overall sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Having considered all of the sentencing principles outlined in the Code, the circumstances of the offence and the offender, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as well as other sentences given to other offenders in similar circumstances, I find that a significant period of incarceration is warranted.\nIf it can be said that there is a sentencing range outlined by the case law for these offences in Saskatchewan or Canada, based on the cases cited, then this case is clearly outside that range. The longest sentence handed down was in Saini, being six years' incarceration, after trial, where four died and nine were injured. Even taking into account Mr. Sidhu's guilty pleas, and even if it could be said his moral blameworthiness was less because his actions were not deliberate, a sentence of more than six years is mandated due to the horrific consequences of his actions.\nConcurrent sentences are appropriate, rather than consecutive, given the offences all arise from the same circumstances. The principles of totality and restraint also guide this decision. I prefer to assign a significant sentence and order all sentences concurrent to each other. If I were to order Mr. Sidhu to serve even short periods of incarceration consecutive to each other, it would not send the same message as a single, lengthy sentence, and would otherwise result in an unduly long and harsh sentence given the number of counts in the information.\nOn count one, dangerous driving causing death, I sentence Mr. Sidhu to eight years' incarceration. On each of counts 2 through 16, inclusive, the remaining counts of dangerous driving causing death, I impose sentences of eight years' incarceration, concurrent to count 1 and concurrent to each other.\nOn each of counts 17 through 29, inclusive, being the thirteen counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, I sentence Mr. Sidhu to five years' incarceration, concurrent to each other and concurrent to counts 1 through 16 inclusive.\nThere are ancillary orders in the Criminal Code that flow from a conviction for dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm. Driving prohibitions are discretionary orders for each offence in the information. Pursuant to s. 259(2)(b), I exercise my discretion and, on count 1 make an order prohibiting Mr. Sidhu from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place in Canada. This order starts today and is for a period of ten years plus any period to which he is sentenced to imprisonment.\nThese convictions are secondary designated offences for which an order for forensic DNA analysis may be made at the discretion of the sentencing judge. In exercising my discretion, I conclude it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to make an order considering the factors as contained within s. 487.051 (3) of the Criminal Code.

        "prompt": "A band of Hong Kong art guardians are on constant standby at the city’s sprawling protest site. Their mission: to swoop in and save a vast array of creative works – including the towering “Umbrella Man” statue – if the police move in.\nOver nearly a month of protests calling for greater democracy in the southern Chinese city, a kilometre-long stretch of highway opposite the government headquarters usually choked with traffic has been transformed into a riotous open air exhibition.\nAt the centre sits what protesters have dubbed “Umbrella Man” – a four-metre-tall wooden sculpture symbolising the protester’s inventive use of umbrellas to defend themselves against everything from rain and tropical heat to police batons and pepper spray.\nWalk through the camp and demonstrators can be seen sketching new works on the road in chalk or hand-crafting hundreds of origami umbrellas. Virtually every wall, central reservation and pillar has become a hanging space while large banners flutter from two bridges crossing the occupied thoroughfare.\nAll the while a team is on constant alert for any sign of an impending police crackdown.\nThe political, grassroots nature of the protest works are far removed from Hong Kong’s usual art scene, dominated by pieces that sell for record-breaking sums.\n“Everyone can see it, everyone can go, everyone can participate,” McGurgan says of the impromptu outdoor art venue.\nBut activists are acutely aware it could all be lost if the police attack.\nMuch of the art at a secondary protest site in the working-class neighbourhood of Mongkok was destroyed in recent clashes with officers.\nNumerous artists have already given their permission for volunteers to remove the pieces at the main site. But finding a place to store them has been more problematic, with the city’s museums balking at taking the works.\nAbout a dozen galleries have stepped in to fill the void, offering to store the pieces safely until more permanent plans can be made. Trucks have also been donated and are ready to remove the pieces should police move in, she said.\nFor pieces such as “Umbrella Man” that task will hopefully be relatively simple: get in, grab the statue, and get out.\nFor the “Lennon Wall”, however – an emotive stretch of wall covered with thousands of sticky notes inscribed with messages from both supporters and detractors of the movement – the task is more complex.\n“We’ve taken large-scale photographs from far away and gridded them off into sections,” McGurgan says of the fragile pink and yellow mosaic.\nIf the situation becomes too dangerous to remove the art safely, she adds, UMAP’s volunteers will do their best to document “the destruction of something beautiful”.\nThat material would then be added to a digital archive that UMAP is also building, potentially even using it to recreate any pieces that might be destroyed.\nIt’s not just the art that activists are struggling to preserve.\nThe Umbrella Movement Visual Archive and Research Collective, another organisation coordinating with UMAP, is working with volunteers to document “how people form a community here, and how they transform the space”, says one of its founders Sampson Wong.\nThat includes everything from street signs that have been altered to show pro-democracy slogans or poke fun at",

It was estimated to be about 3 years old at death, probably female and a member of the Australopithecus afarensis species, the same as Lucy’s.\nAn analysis of the skeleton revealed evidence of a species in transition, the scientists said in interviews yesterday.\nThe lower limbs supported earlier findings that afarensis walked upright, like modern humans. But gorillalike arms and shoulders suggested that it possibly retained an ancestral ability to climb and swing through the trees.\n“Her completeness, antiquity and age at death make this find unprecedented in the history of paleoanthropology,” said Zeresenay Alemseged, the Ethiopian leader of the discovery team and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\nTwo reports of the findings are being published in Nature. The National Geographic Society, a supporter of the research, will run a popular article on the fossil child in the November issue of its magazine.\nAt a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the scientists gave the fossil the name Selam, which means peace in Ethiopia’s official Amharic language.\nScientists not involved in the research said the fossils were a significant find that should provide new insights about the afarensis species and a little-known period of early human origins.\n“The child really confirms that afarensis was walking upright,” said Tim D. White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It has the potential to answer old questions and raises some new ones” — including their behavior in trees. Dr. White, who has found even earlier human ancestors in Ethiopia, participated in the analysis of the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy fossils. They were uncovered not far away in Ethiopia in 1974 by Donald C. Johanson, who is now director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.\nOther discoveries show that the afarensis species, a major branch of the human family tree, lived in Africa from earlier than 3.7 million to 3 million years ago.\nDr. Wood, a paleoanthropologist, also noted how rare it was for the fragile bones of infants to survive long enough to fossilize. “But if they do, they provide precious evidence about the growth and development of the individual and the species,” he wrote.\nUntil now, Dr. Wood said, the earliest comparably complete specimen of a human-related child was that of a Neanderthal who lived less than 300,000 years ago in Syria.\nThe discovery team said the largely intact condition of the fossils indicated that the child was presumably buried in sand and rocks shortly after death during a flood in a desert region known today as Dikika, in northeastern Ethiopia.\nThen, in December 2000, along came a team of fossil hunters led by Dr. Alemseged. On a steep hillside, one of the men, Tilahun Gebreselassie of the Ethiopia Ministry of Culture and Tourism, was the first to see the child’s tiny face looking up from a block of sandstone. It was a long and projecting face with a flat nose.\nThe face and skull were clearly that of a young afarensis, the scientists concluded almost immediately.\nDr. Alemseged’s team spent much of the last five years extracting the rest of the specimen from the surrounding stone with dentist’s drills and picks. The tedious work exposed the full cranium and jaws, the torso and spinal column, limbs and the left foot. The child’s one complete finger was curled in a tiny grasp, much like a young chimpanzee’s. The skeleton is much more complete than Lucy’s.\nAlthough the fossils are still being studied, Dr. Alemseged and his colleagues noted several important findings and areas for further research",

The Dikika girl’s brain size, for example, was about the same as that of a similarly aged chimpanzee, but a comparison with adult afarensis skulls indicates a relatively slow brain growth slightly closer to that of humans.\nThe presence of a hyoid bone was a surprise. It is a rarely preserved bone in the larynx, or voice box, that supports muscles of the throat and tongue. The bone in the infant appeared to be primitive and more similar to those found in apes than in humans, the scientists said, but is the first hyoid found in such an early human-related species and thus important in research about the origins of human speech.\nThe first relatively complete shoulder blades to be found in an australopithecine individual was one of the most puzzling aspects of the discovery, several scientists said. The lower body appeared to be adapted for upright walking by afarensis. But the shoulders and long arms were more apelike.",

        "prompt": "What's behind the rise in c-sections?\nNurses face a particular burden of documentation because unlike most physicians—who are typically self-employed or employed by obstetrical practices—nurses are almost always employed by hospitals, and hospitals provide malpractice insurance for their employees. The hitch, however, is that hospitals will not cover a nurse in a malpractice claim if she did not document that protocols were followed. In fact, consistently breaking protocols is a cause for termination of employment. As nurse Michele Saxton tells me, “If you’re not keeping up on your reading and you’re not up on your standards of care and you don’t know the protocols, you’ll get yourself in trouble. They won’t protect you if you didn’t follow those procedural policies.” Thus nurses become the “enforcers” of protocols; the burden of “compliance” is placed on the least-powerful professional actors, a common practice in organizations. This burden was a common concern of nurses. Some may be surprised to hear that most nurses with whom I spoke are very critical of the way maternity care is being delivered, with a particular scorn toward interventions, such as routine inductions, use of Pitocin for labor acceleration, and, especially, nonmedically indicated c-sections. I think this would especially surprise many midwives, who often have a somewhat cynical view of nurses. Nurses are structurally placed in a situation where they must enforce protocols and document that those protocols have been followed.\nI thought it might interest you to know that I am going to a full-day seminar entitled: “Advanced Fetal Monitoring 2007 and Legal Implications.” There’s no mistaking what this course is about. One of the lectures is titled: “Monitoring for Asphyxia: What You Need to Know and Document.” The reality of the event is the same, but how you document it (and therefore how it’s presented to a jury) is what counts. I think about law all day long.\nConferences spread documentation as the answer to liability threat and also perpetuate a focus on law among maternity providers.\nOne can see how, put in such a position, maternity providers may focus too much on how attorneys will perceive their actions. For example, physician Philip Burgin tells me, “[I think], ‘This wouldn’t have been a shoulder dystocia if you hadn’t delivered that head.’ Because the question posed to a doctor [is], ‘If you’d done a c-section, would this baby be paralyzed now?’ I hear lawyers talking in my head all the time.” It is clear that Doctor Burgin thinks about liability and how attorneys will interpret his actions constantly, likely obsessively.\nYou watch how the physicians are practicing now, and because of malpractice and things that have happened in our own state. . . . Doctors [who] I have worked with for fourteen years, who we call the men and women with “all the feel,” they would watch a strip [with] variables and decels, and they’d [say], “Let’s try this, let’s try that—change position, use amnioinfusion, give herb tea,” whatever. . . . Let’s just say there were five things that you could do when a strip looked bad. Now they are trying one or two things, and if it’s not immediately better, we go down the hall for a c-section.\nPerhaps the most shocking story I heard comes from physician Joe Haley, the mild-mannered, friendly obstetrician who bought me coffee. He lowers his eyes and speaks quietly when he says, “I call my wife when I’m hanging out in labor and delivery, and I say, ‘Oh, the strip looks like this,’ and she says, ‘Just do a section.’ [I feel threatened], and in a serious way, because . . . I mean, she’s not a doctor. But you really are vulnerable, and there’s really no protection.” This is perhaps the most telling example of the fear maternity providers face in modern maternity care. Asking one’s nonphysician spouse for advice on how to manage a woman’s labor seems unbelievable, but it does happen, perhaps in this case as a way Doctor Haley manages his stress and anxiety over caring for women with complicated deliveries.\nMaternity providers feel caught in a bind. The defined way to escape being held accountable for unpreventable negative birth outcomes is to perform a c-section. Then, if a bad outcome happens, they are less likely to be blamed—they did all they could. From the perspective of maternity providers, they are caught in the fundamental irrationality of organizational change. Organizations have defined c-sections as the answer to liability threat. This definition causes maternity providers to change their behavior and perform more c-sections because they fear if they do not they will be blamed for bad birth outcomes, even those outcomes that are not preventable or predictable. The current economic, political, and legal environment binds organizations, and organizations change to protect organizational interests. In this case, professional organizations, malpractice insurers, courts, and hospitals have coalesced in their suggestion that c-sections solve liability threats.\nCourts also enforce this view by focusing on the timing of the c-section. For example, physician Robert Hinson tells me, “When you get deposed in a malpractice lawsuit . . . you will be asked if you could have done the cesarean five or ten minutes earlier or done it an hour earlier . . . and could that have made the difference.” In short, what maternity providers tell me repeatedly is that the message they get from courts on how to prevent malpractice suits is to perform more c-sections and to perform them early. Surgical birth becomes the answer to preventing liability threats, even though there is little evidence that c-sections prevent most bad outcomes.\nI also commonly heard about the role of professional workshops and conferences. As I mentioned just a few pages ago, these workshops and conferences teach maternity providers the importance of documentation in preventing liability threats. However, the messages from these workshops and conferences go beyond documentation that protocols were diligently followed. Physicians talk about how these types of conferences affect how they assess risk in labor. Physician Philip Burgin speaks about a workshop he attended in which a prominent malpractice insurance plaintiffs’ attorney lectured: “One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers said something I [will] never [forget]: ‘OK, if you’re thinking about a c-section, you should be doing a c-section.’” Similarly, physician Lois Timberlake tells me of a lecture she attended at a professional conference: “There was one lecture I heard at a New England ob-gyn society meeting. . . . He started out as an obstetrician, and then he got his law degree, and he was very much, ‘When in doubt, section . . . don’t even think twice about it.’” In other words, attorneys spread fear of bad outcomes and c-section as an answer to this fear.\nLitigating attorneys also spread fear of liability by seeking potential clients through advertising on local radio and television stations. Physicians commonly spoke about litigation attorneys’ television commercials that target them for malpractice lawsuits. Physician Rosemary Steel tells me, “I’m sure you’ve seen those commercials with the lawyers saying, ‘Is your child not as smart as you think [she] should be? Maybe it was a birth injury. Why don’t you give us a call?’ I mean, those kinds of commercials, of course, drive me crazy because they’re picking on things that don’t even exist sometimes.” These types of media presentations are perceived as threatening to maternity providers.\nAre C-Sections Just More Convenient for Obstetricians?\nIt is important here to digress for just a moment to examine the idea that physicians perform c-sections out of convenience, something that is heard in everyday conversation. I argue that convenience should be understood within the organizational constraints physicians face. For example, physicians would likely rather do c-sections outside of office hours rather than attend vaginal births during office hours because they need to see patients to earn money to pay skyrocketing malpractice premiums. Most health insurance companies pay a global fee for birth. That means that health insurance companies pay the physician a single rate, usually between $2,500 and $3,500, for all prenatal visits and the birth. Physicians are not compensated for attending a long labor, and if a physician interrupts office hours to attend a birth, he or she will potentially lose money by not seeing scheduled patients. Remember, as malpractice insurance premiums escalate, obstetricians must see more and more patients just to cover that increased rate. Protecting office hours becomes a necessity. Further, although providers performing c-sections in the evening may seem to smack of convenience, it is also the case that evening c-sections allow providers not to miss any office hours and to sleep at night. Getting a good night’s sleep is in the interest of providers who, because of increasing malpractice insurance rates, feel a pressure to see patients as many days in the week as possible. Many maternity providers told me they often have a full slate of patients, even if they were on call the night before. Obstetricians also expressed concern about the safety of c-sections during the nighttime because everyone is likely to be more tired.\nIn other words, liability may underlie “convenience” because of the pressure to earn money to pay malpractice insurance premiums. It may be that some physicians are performing c-sections to go play golf or to go to dinner, but with most physicians operating in group practices, this is not as much of a concern as it used to be with solo practices. In short, organizational constraints are a better explanation of practices that seem to be convenient for physicians.\nSo why not? . . . We’re not stupid. You kick us long enough, we respond. Do we believe in it? No. Do I believe we’re doing far too many c-sections? Absolutely. But every once in a while, you’ll try to let someone labor longer, even if it’s unpredictable because nature’s unpredictable, shoulder events, something will happen, and we’ll get blamed for it. So until society decides it doesn’t want to put up with this anymore, we’re going to continue to move in this direction because that’s what society has asked us to do.\nOrganizations have responded to uncertain legal, political, and economic environments, and one response that has coalesced among organizations has been to define c-sections as the gold standard for a “safe” birth.\nStill, women do not commonly perceive that their births are being held in the hands of providers who feel backed into a corner. They trust their doctors and believe that if they recommend a c-section, it must be necessary. The Listening to Mothers II Survey found that, while 62 percent of women believe that the current malpractice system causes providers to take better care of their patients, well less than half believe that providers would perform an unnecessary c-section to avoid being sued.

Yeah, so it was a little disappointing, but at the end all that matters is a healthy baby and healthy me, of course. Right?” What would women like Dianne think if they knew how preoccupied their providers are with being blamed for a bad outcome?

        "prompt": "We spent a few days with a gasoline-powered 2018 Chevy Equinox back in May, but now we've driven a much rarer version.\nThe 2018 Chevrolet Equinox Diesel will start to arrive at U.S. Chevy dealers within two weeks, the company says.\nOn Wednesday, as part of a comprehensive presentation on the five diesel engines GM uses globally, we got some \"seat time\" in a diesel Equinox.\nUnfortunately, it was a very, very short drive: about 12 minutes, most of it at speeds below 40 mph.\nWe goofed on one part of the route instructions, and managed to travel two exits (about 1.5 miles) at highway speeds on a short section of one of the many Interstates in and around Teaneck, New Jersey.\nOur conclusions thus far: the diesel version of the Equinox seems relatively quiet for a diesel vehicle, and it's entirely acceptable on the road.\nThat's really about all we could discern, and it roughly matched our expectations.\nThe more interesting question will be what kind of fuel economy the diesel Equinox returns.\nUnlike the diesel Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan, which can be ordered with a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 9-speed automatic transmission, only a 6-speed automatic is available in the diesel Equinox.\nThe engine's chief engineer, Mike Siegrist, explained that because the same 137-horsepower 1.6-liter turbodiesel-4 is used in both vehicles, the extra gears largely went unused as the engine worked harder to move the heavier Equinox.\nBut the Equinox comes with a front- or all-wheel drive option, which the Cruze doesn't.\nBoth versions of the diesel crossover are rated at 32 mpg combined, and 28 mpg in the city. The AWD version loses 1 mpg on its high-speed rating, going from the front-drive model's 39 mpg highway to 38 mpg.\nChevrolet's presentation compared only the highway rating of the diesel Equinox to those of various hybrid compact crossovers, not the car's combined rating.\nIt stressed several times that the diesel Cruze and Equinox will be most attractive to drivers who cover lots of miles at highway speeds, where the vehicles may well overachieve on their EPA ratings.\nIndeed, over our standard drive route of two-thirds highway miles and one-third city and suburban traffic, the automatic Cruze Diesel we tested earlier this year returned a stunning 48.2 mpg reading on the trip computer.\nThat was significantly better than the car's EPA ratings, which are 31 mpg city, 47 mpg highway, and 37 mpg combined.\nDiesel fuel has roughly 20 percent more energy per gallon, but its cost differential with gasoline is less than that in most states, making it a good value.\nThe price differential for the diesel engine",

The message boards warped into meltdown mode.\nIzzo has directed five of the last 11 Michigan State teams to the Final Four. He understands the rhythms of how habits formed in December shape what happens in March. A player as gifted and as gritty as Kalin Lucas needed to lead more forcefully than Lucas was leading.

        "prompt": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a.k.a. the stimulus act, provides more money for college financial aid. President Obama's proposed budget includes even more changes, but they need congressional approval.\nHere's a look at what will happen under the stimulus act and what could happen under Obama's budget.\nPell Grants: The stimulus act increases funding for Pell Grants, which go to students from low- and moderate-income families, generally those making less than $40,000 a year. These grants do not have to be repaid and can be used for tuition and living expenses.\nFor the 2008-09 school year, Pell Grants range from $400 to $4,731. The stimulus bill adds $500 to the maximum for 2009-10 only. Including a previously scheduled increase, that brings the year's maximum to $5,350.\nMark Kantrowitz, publisher of Finaid.com, estimates that the stimulus bill will increase the number of Pell Grant recipients by about 800,000. Many new recipients won't get the maximum grant, though, \"because they will be on the edge of eligibility,\" he says.\nObama's budget would transform the grants into an entitlement program, like Social Security and Medicare. That means money would go into the program every year automatically, according to a formula, instead of being partially dependent on annual appropriations from Congress. The maximum Pell Grant would start at $5,500 in 2010-11 and go up each year by the consumer price index plus one percentage point.\nNancy Coolidge, who coordinates student financial aid for the UC system, supports the entitlement idea, but would like Obama to go a step further and index Pell Grant eligibility to the regional cost of living, so more students in high-cost areas would qualify.\nTax credit revamp: Today, most undergrads or their parents - depending on who pays the bills - can claim one of three tax breaks: the Hope Scholarship, the Lifetime Learning credit or the tuition and fees deduction. All three have different rules and income limits.\nThe stimulus act replaces the Hope Scholarship with the more generous American Opportunity Tax Credit. The change is effective for only for tax years 2009 and 2010, unless Congress extends it.\nThe existing Hope Scholarship, which is really a tax credit, can only be claimed for students in their first two years of college. The maximum credit is $1,800. It is phased out, or gradually reduced to zero, for singles with adjusted gross incomes between $48,000 and $58,000 and for married couples with incomes between $96,000 and $116,000. The Hope credit is not refundable, which means you cannot claim it if you don't earn enough to pay income tax. It can be claimed only for tuition and fees.\nThe American Opportunity tax credit can be claimed in years one through four of college. The maximum is $2,500 per year. The income phaseout range rises to $80,000 to $90,000 for singles and $160,000 to $180,000 for couples. And it's partially refundable: You can claim up to $1,000 even if you don't pay federal income tax. It can also be claimed against textbook expenses.\nObama was hoping to replace all three college tax breaks with the American Opportunity credit, but the other two are still available.\nThe Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition and fees deduction can be used for any year of college, including grad school. But Kantrowitz says most families will choose the American Opportunity credit over the other two for undergrads, because the other two are less generous and have lower income limits.\nWork study: The stimulus act adds $200 million for federal work study, enough for an additional 181,000 recipients, Kantrowitz estimates.\n529",

Angus King (I-ME) is holding a 3;30 pm et presser in Brunswick, ME to discuss with which party he will caucus next year.\nHe was telling everyone who’d listen last night that he’s open to caucusing with the GOP if they retook the Senate. That appears to be his Plan B. Plan A was (or is?) to organize some sort of independent/centrist caucus in the Senate that would serve as a balance of power between the two parties. Er, why would any Republican moderate want to join a caucus like that now that they’re back in charge, knowing that it might cost them committee chairmanships to do so?\nIt’s one thing to switch parties, as Joe Manchin might conceivably do. That would indicate a commitment to one’s new caucus that would, presumably, persist even if the other party takes the Senate back in 2016. There’s value in that. What would the GOP get, though, from accepting King into the fold and handing him some plum committee slots, with no assurance that he wouldn’t turn around and caucus with Democrats again two years from now? It’d be one thing if they were sitting at 59 votes and he was promising to be the 60th vote for cloture on all bills supported by the leadership, but even with 55 seats Republicans would be nowhere near that. In which case, why would they care if King wants to caucus with them? What’s he offering here? Stay tuned. He’s going to speak at 3:30.\nUpdate: If Sullivan and Cassidy win and King and Manchin both agree to caucus with the GOP, now you’re at 56 seats. The closer you get to 60, the more attractive it is to add indies and centrist Democrats to your caucus. But, er, there are no indies and centrist Democrats left after these two, right?

The GOP can argue that they are the true party of broad-based governance if they can attract an independent like King to switch caucuses, and a Democrat like Manchin to switch parties. It would be a PR move, and a wise one at a low cost. They might bargain more for Manchin than for King, who really has nowhere else to go as an independent, but both Senators would still be joining the GOP caucus on the GOP’s terms.\nUpdate (AP): Clown show, bro.\nAngus King announces that he will NOT switch to the GOP.

Youthfully naive, he was scared he might lose his if he came too close.\nThe pain of witnessing this strained interaction between her children inspired their mother, Tracey Clark of Columbia, to join the national war against cancer.\nRallying on the National Mall in Washington yesterday, Clark and her daughter, who is in remission, joined an estimated 80,000 cancer patients, loved ones, activists, celebrities and politicians who united behind a single message: It's time for a cure.\n\"We want to be the generation that ends the war on cancer, and ends it with a victory,\" said Vice President Al Gore.\n\"We are united as Americans to fight this cause.\"\nIn the United States alone, cancer claims an estimated 1,500 people every day. Yesterday's event, known as \"The March, Coming Together to Conquer Cancer,\" was billed as the first large-scale demonstration against the disease to involve people and groups other than patients, physicians and researchers. Organizers said they hoped to draw attention to the need for more investment in cancer prevention, research and quality health care for Americans.\nThroughout the day, speakers showered the crowd with statistics related to the disease: Cancer is expected to kill 564,800 Americans this year, the American Cancer Society estimates. Half of all men, and one-third of all women, will develop some form of cancer.\nIn Maryland, the society projects that 10,500 people will die of the disease in 1998. Statewide this year, the society expects 22,900 new cancer cases to be reported.\n\"People are angry and frustrated,\" said Dr. Donald Coffey, an oncology researcher at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.\n\"They believe that there has been a war, and it has failed. This hasn't been a war on cancer. This has been a skirmish.\"\nCoffey, former president of the American Association for Cancer Research and an organizer of yesterday's events, complained that 75 percent of cancer research grant proposals are denied funding.\nThe doctor joined about 250 people who crammed into five buses at the Johns Hopkins Medical School campus early yesterday and made the trip to Washington.\nThe event was endorsed by more than 500 organizations, including the American Cancer Society.\n\"There are so many people affected, and this is such a great opportunity to reach a wider audience,\" said society spokesman Steve Jones, who estimated that the mid-Atlantic division of the organization bused in 1,500 people, many from Maryland.\nBrian Devlin, 48, of Baltimore, who co-chairs the Greater Baltimore Alliance for Cancer Survivorship, said the event was momentous because for the first time, activists seeking cures for the various forms of cancer were launching a unified campaign, instead of squabbling for funding. \"Research cures cancer -- that's the reality,\" said Devlin, who is in his eleventh year of remission after being diagnosed with leukemia.\nVicki Davidson, 46, of Pottstown, Pa., believes she was helped by research. Doctors told her last year that she had an advanced form of lung cancer that was inoperable. But after she endured nine courses of an experimental chemotherapy, doctors were able to remove what remained of the tumor.\n\"I want to help other people,\" said Davidson, pointing out that her hair was returning. She held a sign that read, \"I want to live, not die.\"\n\"Some people are calling me a miracle,\" she said.\nSinger Aretha Franklin and super-model Cindy Crawford gave the event celebrity status. Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the event's honorary chairman, gave a spirited, podium-pounding speech, insisting that elected officials follow through on promises for more research funding.\nGore, whose sister died of lung cancer, called in his address for more access to clinical trials, tighter privacy laws for medical records so Americans who are told that their genetic code makes them likely to develop cancer are not denied health coverage, and more spending on research. The Clinton administration and Congress are already planning to increase the cancer research budget for next year.\nBut in the shadow of the main stage were smaller-scale events perhaps equally as important.\nClark, the Maryland mother -- whose daughter, Morgan, now 5, has received a good prognosis for a full life -- was introduced at an early-morning ceremony where she helped to unveil a mammoth quilt, covered with little,",

Bennett of New Haven Mills, Vt., told a panel of leading physicians that cancer doctors need to be more patient-friendly. Bennett has started a support group in his town for prostate cancer patients.\nAt another tent, members of People Animals Love spoke of how they cheer up cancer patients in hospitals and nursing homes by bringing animals to visit.\n\"We visited a retired general recently,\" said Margo Edmunds, standing beside her 7-year-old border collie, Tess. \"He was very depressed, and terminally ill.

        "prompt": "Palin says an Obama comment was reckless.\n(CNN) - Sarah Palin said Friday several of Barack Obama's comments about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been \"reckless\" and disqualify the Illinois senator for consideration as the next commander-in-chief.\nThe comments are among the Alaska governor's most pointed to date regarding the Democratic presidential candidate's readiness to serve and come one day after she aggressively jousted with Democratic VP nominee Joe Biden.\n\"Some of his comments that he has made about the war…I think, in my world, disqualifies someone from consideration as the next commander-in-chief,\" Palin told Fox News Friday. \"Some of the comments he's made about Afghanistan, what we are doing there, supposedly just air-raiding villages and killing civilians - that's reckless.\"\nPalin was referring to an answer Barack Obama gave at a August 2007 town hall meeting with New Hampshire voters, during which the Illinois senator was asked whether he had plans to shift U.S. troops out of Iraq to other terrorist hotspots like Afghanistan.\n\"We've got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous pressure over there,\" Obama said of the U.S.'s mission in Afghanistan.\nThose comments were immediately seized by GOP critics. The Republican National Committee sent out a press release shortly after calling them \"offensive,\" and demanding he apologize. The McCain campaign has also highlighted the comments several times this campaign season. An AP Fact Check later reported Western forces had been killing civilians at a higher rate than insurgents.\nPalin also commented Friday on her widely-panned series of interviews with Katie Couric, telling Fox interviewer she did not think the CBS News anchor asked enough issue-based questions.\n“I did feel there were a lot of things she was missing in terms of an opportunity to ask what a VP candidate stands for, what the values are that are represented in our ticket,\" Palin said. \"I guess I have to apologize for being a bit annoyed, but that’s also an indication about being outside that Washington elite, outside that media elite also, and just wanting to talk to Americans without the filter and let them know what we stand for.\"\nIn two separate and lengthy interviews with Couric over the last week, Palin seemed to struggle with a number of answers, including a defense of McCain's record on regulation issues. She also appeared to stumble when relating her views on the financial bailout, her foreign policy credentials, her preferred news sources of news, and a Supreme Court case she disagrees with.\n\"Man, no matter what you say you are gonna get clobbered,\" Palin told Fox about her heavily-scrutinized performance. \"You choose to answer you are going to get clobbered on the answer. If you choose to pivot and try to go onto another subject that you believe Americans want to hear about, you get clobbered for that too.\"\nThis woman is really starting to be annoying! Not only her screechy voice, but her self-righteous, know-it-all attitude, which just basically shows she is desperatley trying to disguise how inept she is.\nAmerica, please don't let her or McCain near the white house!!\nShe was wonderful in the debate.\nAwwww please.....I am voting for Barack just because I do not want to hear her 3rd grade answers again!\nShe survived the debate which she and her about 20 advisors crammed for. Now how's about we go on to Meet the Press or any other intelligent interviews?\nAnd Sean Hannity or the other dunces at Fox News don't count!\nJust because she isn't an elitest, East Coast snob does not mean she is stupid folks. Personally, I am sick and tired of this bunch of idiots on the \"hill\" telling the rest of American what we need. Obama is by far the worst snobby, smirking, \"I'm better than you\" elitest of them all. I would rather vote for a team that knows what I experience than that lying, South Chicago, Daley-Machine robot Obama. Because he doesn't have a clue.\nAnd not knowing what I vp does, or not thinking much about a war that had gone on for years (Iraq) doesn't automatically disqualify her?\nThis is the same woman who would use her \"power as vice president\" over the senate. Yes the vp is the president of the senate and acts as a tie breaking vote, but I think she missed the boat about the checks and balances and seperations of our three branches.\nAs for Obama raising taxes the has constantly been proven as misleading, maybe her campaign should look at the fact that ECONOMISTS feel the Obama camp is offering the better economic plan.\nSarah should go home and keep a sharp eye out for Putin flying over.\nSilly Sarah might be qualified as a writer for Saturday Night Live but, anything else, no way!\nWhat he did was speak the truth...Sarah Palin obviously cannot handle the truth.\nThis women showed me last night althought she is very \"folky\" that I want to have a VP twhoknows more than what she was taught in a few weeks.\nI do not understand the people that will vote for McCain because Sarah Palin is a mom and is nice!!!\nThis is our Country we are talking about!!

        "prompt": "The wristwatch was nearly killed off by the cell phone revolution, but with the rise of the smartphone it’s about to evolve into something more powerful than it’s ever been.\nInvestors, and a number of industry heavies, have just acquired the smartwatch business of Meta Watch, as well as all its IP. The players include Juho Pinomaa, the former president of Sunnto (which makes dive computers, smart sports, and GPS watches), formerly of Nokia, and Bill Geiser and David Rosales, who used to lead the connected watch division of Fossil. The developer-centric Meta Watch is already due on sale this month, but these moves show that there’s serious interest in the future of the digital watch–and Meta is only one of the players. Lest you doubt the seriousness of these moves, consider that one of the players involved is Apple.\nChances are, you don’t wear a watch and haven’t for quite some time. Meanwhile, your smartphone is shoved into a pocket, briefcase, or purse right now, and all your SMS’s, phone calls, Twitter updates, and Facebook statuses are reeling on in the fabric-lined darkness. It would be amazingly handy (pun intended), in a world where more and more of us “check in” to places, snap photos, and share status feeds at an ever increasing pace, to have all that possible on your wrist.\nFaced by shrinking sales of its traditional watches that really do little more than tell the time, Fossil began a project some time ago to develop a future connected watch–a digital device that would offer much more data to a tiny display. Meta Watch was the result, a mini computer, with Bluetooth and display, running a custom operating system. It’s now an independant entity, and it has an unusual remit: To appeal to developers and hardware hackers, to try to establish an ecosystem of apps and new ways of utilizing the display as an additional way to access what’s going on on your smartphone (mainly Android units, at first).\nAnd Meta Watch isn’t alone. In Italy, two entrepreneurs are busy finalizing the design of the I’mWatch. It’s tiny, slim, highly styled (and highly expensive–in some jewel-encrusted iterations it costs around $15,000) and unlike the Meta it has a full-colour display and sophisticated touch interface enabled by its own on-board Android OS. It’s on pre-order starting at €250 now, and is due to make its first public appearance at the ARM tech conference in just 44 days. Though the company is cagey about what it can be used for, its promotional material shows calendar apps, weather feeds, MP3 players, news feeds, Facebook apps, and Twitter too–and it’ll come with a bunch of pre-loaded apps as well as extras via the proprietary “I’mStore.” Though it’s compatible with the iPhone, the I’mWatch seems to be a cleverer implementation of something Sony tried with its LiveView innovation for its own Android units.\nThese two devices are smart, sophisticated extra displays that run in addition to your smartphone and let you take some of the utility onto your wrist: They can buzz, for example, to let you know a call is coming in and prompting you to peep at the watch to see who’s calling–much easier than fishing a phone out of a pocket or bag–and if you were on a morning commute, you’d then perhaps decide to leave the call until later.\nBut don’t forget Apple–its touchscreen iPod Nano was an unexpected hit as a watch, spawning a large industry in peripheral watch straps. Apple seems to, at first, have not expected the Nano to be used in this way, and though it sported an attractive analog watch display, it wasn’t enabled to pop up when the iPod was prompted from sleep–it took an update to make this change. But the existing Nano doesn’t have any connectivity, and while it does run apps, they’re all proprietary and can’t be changed. We know Apple is planning an update to the device, possibly adding in a camera–but that’s all we know.\nIt’s possible Apple is planning something novel with the device to turn it into a full-fledged wrist computer, if not for this immediate update then for one in the near future. The first clue is the incorporation of Bluetooth 4.0 in newer Apple gear. The standard is a lower power consumption one than current Bluetooth hardware, thus improving battery life, and offers simpler “pairing” between devices–meaning it would be perfectly plausible for your iPhone or Mac to quickly, efficiently, and simply send data to your nearby Nano.\nAnd with Apple’s control of the app ecosystem, a connected iPod Nano could become a powerful competitor to the I’mWatch and Meta Watch. You can easily imagine Apple building in a motion-gesture system to the device, meaning you’d simply have to shake your wrist to reject an incoming call on your iPhone. And though the prototype iPod Nano had a camera on the back, there’s not much to stop Apple adding it to the front or side of the device to act as a FaceTime camera or useful go-everywhere camera. With sophisticated voice recognition on the way for the iPhone, the tiny screen of a wrist Nano wouldn’t even be a barrier to",
        "baseline": " updating your Twitter feed.\nAnd that’s why you’ll buy another wristwatch. Smartphones are, of course, incredibly powerful tools. But as they get more powerful, many seem to be getting slightly larger–even the iPhone 5 is rumored to be bigger, if flatter.\nThe always-accessible nature of a smartwatch may appeal to a generation who’re used to “checking in” on Foursquare everywhere they go, as well as basic status reading and updating on Facebook. And all those rumors of NFC payments get even more interesting if you consider that you could actually pay by simply waving your wrist over a sensor pad, with all the NFC circuits in the watch and its wristband, and all the hardware handshaking–including store loyalty cards and in-store downloaded ads–happening on the phone, securely in your pocket.\nMerely telling the time by glancing at your wrist?

        "prompt": "As UK Film Shows Sri Lankan General Silva Bragging of Killing 1500 Civilians, What Will UN &Ban Ki-moon Say?\nUNITED NATIONS, March 15 -- During the killing of tens of thousands of civilians by the Sri Lankan government in 2009, the UN withheld its own count of casualties, withdrew its international staff and even played a role in luring to surrender people who were then summarily executed.\nThe UN Secretariat never called for a ceasefire, and the UN Security Council never had a formal meeting on the mass killings. Now one of the military leaders of the campaign, Brigadier General Shavendra Silva, has been made a part of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's Senior Advisory Group on Peacekeeping Operations, and Ban has had nothing to say beyond \"it's up to member states.\"\nSilva appears in UK Channel 4's \"Sri Lanka’s Killing Fields: War Crimes Unpunished,\" which premiered last night on television in the UK, and re-appeared overnight on YouTube. Click here to view, for Silva from Minute 21:56.\nThe documentary focused on four particular war crimes, including an assault on Putumattalan which killed at least 1,500 civilians.\nThe direct assault was carried out by the 58th Division under the command of Shavendra Silva, who appears on screen describing it as \"very successful.\"\nWhile the Sri Lankan Mission to the UN has in a letter sent to Ban's spokesman's office and select UN scribes attacked Inner City Press for writing about Silva, claiming as subsequently did some in the UN Asia Group that Silva's 58th Division is not directly indicted in the UN Panel of Experts report, this new footage including Silva's bragging should put an end to that.\nWith so much talk at the UN about accountability, how can the general who led and bragged about the killing of 1,500 civilians continue as an adviser to the UN on peacekeeping? We'll see.\nThe documentary also has former UK foreign minister David Miliband and former UN humanitarian chief John Holmes taking positions much more protective of civilians than what either did when they had power. Holmes, for example, resisted calling for a ceasefire.\nOn the May 2009 trip to Sri Lanka with Ban Ki-moon and his outgoing political chief Lynn Pascoe, which Inner City Press went on and covered, Holmes on the record on the plane bemoaned all the e-mail pleas he was receiving from Tamils, saying \"I just delete them.\"\nAfter from Colombo Inner City Press reported the quote, Holmes demanded that it be removed, using other journalists from UK-based media organizations to pressure Inner City Press. Maybe he misspoke. Now in a cushy academic job, Holmes says Sri Lanka got away with it. Yes: with the UN's and OCHA's help.\nHolmes refusal in 2009 to call for a ceasefire stands in contrast to his successor Baroness Valerie Amos' stance on Syria. But is this a personal or political difference?\nInner City Press asked the UK Mission to the UN \"does the UK have a position on if it is appropriate that Sri Lankan Brigadier General Shavendra Silva serve on the UN Senior Advisory Group on Peacekeeping Operations, given the way he and his 58th Division are depicted in the S-G's Panel of Experts' Report on Sri Lanka, and in UK Channel 4 films, past and to be broadcast in the UK tomorrow night?\"\nMidday on March 14, UK Mission spokesman Daniel Shepherd replied that the UK \"highly values the Senior Advisory Group, and our own representative on it will work to help the Group come up with the best possible recommendations on the issues they are addressing. The Chairperson of the SAG has, following consultation with other SAG members, advised Major General Shavendra Silva that his participation is not appropriate or helpful for the purposes of the Group. We understand that he will not participate in its deliberations.\"\nThat is still by no means certain. Inner City Press covered the Asia Group meeting at which Sri Lanka tried to rally other countries in the Group to the defense of Silva; Ban Ki-moon has not spoken in support of Frechette.\nDespite the harrowing footage and the high number of civilians killed, the Sri Lanka issue does not have the traction of Syria, or even #Kony2012. As viewers, mostly in the UK, tweeted about the film on Wednesday night, many expressed disgust at Ban's UN and said that if Sri Lanka had a lot of oil, the West would have intervened as it did in Libya.\nBut there are others not directly interested in oil who have held back on Sri Lanka, perhaps due to the specter of terrorism. To a three organization panel at the UN on March 14, Inner City Press asked if Silva's position as UN adviser on peacekeeping, and Ban Ki-moon silence, were appropriate.\nThe representative of Amnesty International said that advisers should be \"vetted\" for war crimes. But the representative of Human Rights Watch, when asked Wednesday on UN TV, had nothing to say on the topic. Video here, at end. HRW has previously refused to even summarize its boss Ken Roth's meeting with Ban Ki-moon, saying that to do so might undermine HRW's \"access.\" Access for what?\nThere are many for whom it is convenient that the killing of tens of thousand of civilians in Sri Lanka in",

As exposed by Inner City Press in video, Ban Ki-moon made time to watch the government \"rebuttal\" before he ever watched Killing Fields I.

        "prompt": "Are we really secular or pagan?\nBy Peter Sellick - posted Wednesday, 12 April 2017 Sign Up for free e-mail updates!\nSecularism is an ideology that tells us that there exists a neutral and rational sphere of knowledge by which communities may be ruled to the exclusion of any religious knowledge. While religious ideas are tolerated, they are relegated to the realm of the private. Thus political actors are expected to place their religious understanding to one side and to collaborate within the neutrality of secularism.\nThe first thing to be said about this is that there is no such neutral sphere. The error of secularism is that it limits what it understands as being religion to identified belief systems and fails to see that religious thought and practice does not have to be named as \"religious\" to hold humanity in its power. It is a common observation that anti-religious regimes in the past such as the French and Russian revolutions, nazism and fascism all exhibit religious aspects. These include the attachment to ideology, personality cults, ritual practices and mass man mentality.\nIn order to understand the absence of a neutral sphere we must understand more deeply the essence of religion. Religion is that which, after the Latin, binds. Thus religion cannot be restricted to the known and recognised religions but exists as the common human desire to trust in something and to be bound by that something. Indeed, it is impossible to live without unsupported assumptions and the belief that is derived from them. We are all believers of some kind.\nThis analysis reveals that secularism is not neutral and never can be because there is no sphere of human existence that is free from deep investment in something. We can name such secular idols as the market, life style, health, prestige, power, influence, progress, self-esteem, consumption etc. All of these can be idols; things that determine human hope, desire and action may be found within a supposedly non-religious sphere. As Luther observed: the heart is a factory for idols.\nThe deceptive thing about idols is that anything, even the most basic impulses and foundations of our lives can become idolised. The family, for example, exists as the place of nurture and love for all of us. However, the family can become idolatrous as in the Mafia. Idols do not exist without human investment. It is that investment that robs us of our freedom and installs idols of the heart.\nIt follows that there is no such thing as a neutral sphere from which government can operate that is free of idolatry. We might think that we can govern under the auspices of reason alone but this is to misunderstand how reason works. Reason always brings with it presuppositions that cannot be derived by reason alone. A brief course in European philosophy will hammer this fact home. There have, been attempts to find foundations for reason that do not presume anything and thus do not rely on some kind of belief. In the seventeenth century it was thought that mathematics could be such a foundation. However, the results have been stunted and obviously fail to address the simplest questions such as \"who am I, and what should I do?\"\nSecularists have used reason as a weapon against religious thought from the beginning even in spite of two thousand years of theological research that held reason as its guiding light. The priests of secularism have driven a wedge between faith and reason that may make sense at the level of simplistic belief but is wide of the mark when it comes to the theology of the Church. When one reads Augustine, or Aquinas, or Calvin we find reason at work on the key questions that face humanity of identity, meaning and purpose. Reason is a tool that is used to understand and extend traditions of thought about what it means to be human.\nI read recently that it is inaccurate to describe Australia or indeed any country as being secular. Rather, a more accurate description would be that Australia is in the grip of paganism. Paganism is multiple idolatry: the worship of many things that are not God. The idea that the secular sphere is free of such idolatry is easily confuted as theologically naïve. It is the nature of the human heart to manufacture idols and the ideology of secularism has no power to stem the flow. Indeed, it seems that in the absence of the iconoclasm of the Church, which is one of its central functions, idolatry increases on every front.\nSecularism is paganism in disguise. It assumes that because no identifiable traditional religion can be identified that religious assumptions and practices are absent. In our quest to free ourselves from religion we have fallen into the very pit of religious thought in the same way that the quest for freedom in the French and Russian revolution led to the Terror and the worst tyranny of all.\nA key function of the Church is iconoclasm, the destruction of idols. It is also true that the Church, in faintheartedness and in fear for its own life, has betrayed us in this task. The Church does not seem to see that it presides over the destruction of \"religion",
        "baseline": "\" in order to bear witness to the one icon of God, the image that replaces all idols, the crucified Jesus.\nPart of our problem is that we have assumed that all religions vary in details but are much of a muchness. But Christianity differs from the world religions in that it contains a critique of religion itself. It was because of this critique that Jesus was framed and murdered, such was the fear of the religious authorities of the time.\nSo there is a paradox here, Christianity looks like a religion quacks like a religion and so must be a religion. However, it also bears witness to the end of all religion and the beginning of faith. In the shadow of the cross religion is faithlessness. It is in the passion of Christ that religion is judged because it was religion that hammered in the nails.\nChristianity is the critique of all religion including the secular kind that declares that it is not a religion. In the final analysis, secularism does not really exist.",

Earlier on Friday it was reported that about 180 military personnel had been called in to assist the investigation into the attempted murder of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.\nThe additional personnel were deployed to remove potentially contaminated evidence. Meanwhile, police were seen at the cemetery where the grave of Skripal’s wife, Liudmila, and a memorial to his son, Alexander, who both died in the last few years, lie in adjacent plots that had been cordoned off earlier in the week.\nPolice placed a blue forensic tent over the memorial to Alexander at Salisbury’s London Road cemetery. Fire officers in hazmat suits were seen pinning down the tent, while other officers in white suits and gas masks were seen packing items from the cemetery into a yellow barrel.\nIt had previously been reported that Liudmila died of cancer in 2012 aged 59, while Alexander Skripal died in March last year in St Petersburg, aged 43, in unknown circumstances.\nThe Metropolitan police said reports that a body had been exhumed on Friday were untrue. It is believed that Yulia Skripal may have visited her brother’s memorial stone on his birthday, 1 March – three days before she and her father were taken ill.\nAs the investigation entered a new phase, the authorities were still seeking to establish exactly where and when a British police officer was poisoned.\nDS Nick Bailey is seriously ill in hospital having visited the home of Skripal after the defector and his daughter were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday afternoon.\nInvestigators want to know whether Bailey visited the scene where the two Russians were found and was poisoned there or by items there, or whether the officer was contaminated on his visit to Skripal’s home.\nSources say that, while it is not certain, it is believed more likely that Bailey became contaminated on his visit to the home.\nUncertainty about how and where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned led to police requesting military assistance on Friday to secure contaminated evidence. It is understood that personnel from the Royal Marines, the RAF and chemical teams were involved in the operation.\nThe Met police said the units were called in because they had “the necessary capability and expertise” and urged the public not to be alarmed.\nSergei, 66, and Yulia, 33, are comatose in hospital after being found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre.\nThe investigation widened on Thursday as police sealed off the memorials to Liudmila and Alexander, and said 21 people had been treated as a result of the incident.\nBailey was described by Kier Pritchard, Wiltshire’s temporary chief constable, as “a massively dedicated officer”. Pritchard said the detective sergeant was “very anxious, very concerned” but sitting up in bed and talking. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, met Bailey during her visit to Salisbury district hospital on Friday.\nThe NHS confirmed that the Skripals were in a critical but stable condition, while Bailey was conscious in a serious but stable condition.\nRudd said: “It is still very serious for the two people subject to this outrageous attack. For the police officer, it is still serious but we understand he is conversing and engaging.\nRudd did not reveal further details about the substance, how it was deployed or who used it.\nIan Blair, who was Metropolitan police commissioner when the former spy Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London, has suggested one line of inquiry is that Skripal may have been exposed to the nerve agent in his own home.\n“Clearly what they’re trying to find out at the moment is how was this delivered personally.

They would be able to establish where it came from – the level of authority is another matter,” he said.\nThe use of a nerve toxin is seen as a key indicator of possible Kremlin involvement, with such substances usually held only in state military stockpiles.\nMoscow has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack, the same line used when Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in his cup of tea.

        "prompt": "From now on you know our name.\n--Women Artists Visibility Event protest song.\nSinging \"I'm so blue, I wanna show my art to you,\" about 100 women will stage a protest \"performance\" against sexual discrimination in the art world on Saturday on the steps of City Hall beneath a 16-foot-tall archetypal goddess, her arms raised triumphantly above her head.\nThe noon Women Artists Visibility Event (WAVE) is part of a demonstration to be waged simultaneously in 12 cities across the nation.\nThe Women's Caucus for Art, a national, nonprofit advocacy group, is sponsoring the event to promote visibility for women artists and to draw attention to what it's calling a gap between opportunities available to men and women in the professional visual art world.\n\"The purpose of WAVE is to dramatize the excellence of contemporary women artists' work,\" said sculptor Linda Cunningham, WAVE national coordinator, \"to call attention to the significant achievements of women artists and to raise questions with major art institutions about their failure to recognize and present this work to the public.\n\"More than half of the people graduating with master's degrees in art are women. But in the last six years, at the Whitney and Guggenheim museums, for example, only five of 58 solo shows were devoted to women; 53 were devoted to men. So there's something terribly askew at the professional level.\"\nWAVE organizers say protesters' plans include a march with balloons reading \"genius has no gender\" from the Whitney Museum to the Guggenheim Museum in New York; a gathering outside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington; exhibits, pickets and a barge ride down Texas' San Antonio River.\nLocal WAVE participants, all members of the Southern California chapter of the women's caucus, have conducted research to support their charges, as have many other WAVE groups.\n\"The neglect is at higher and higher levels,\" said artist Ruth Weisberg, USC fine arts professor and caucus national vice president. \"It's now fairly commonplace in Los Angeles for women to have gallery representation, but the problem is with museum retrospective exhibitions, catalogue representation and newspaper and magazine articles about solo shows.\"\nAnnie Shaver-Crandell, caucus national president and an art historian, said, \"My objection is that the institutions targeted by WAVE are often recipients of federal money. That money is generated from people like myself and I expect it to come back to people like myself.\"\n--Neither the County Museum of Art nor the Museum of Contemporary Art have ever mounted a major solo retrospective exhibition of a woman artist.\n--Between 1980 and 1986 at the County Museum of Art, 11% of all solo exhibitions featured women artists.\n--Los Angeles Times reviews of all solo exhibits--written by various Times art reviewers--from January, 1982, to March, 1986, averaged 24% women artists.\n--Herald Examiner reviews of solo exhibits--only those written by critic Christopher Knight in the paper's Sunday section--from October, 1983, to April, 1985, were 10% women artists.\nLocal WAVE researchers also cite a National Endowment for the Arts finding that in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area, 33% of professional artists are women.\nArtist Carol Neiman, co-coordinator of the local protest, said letters containing all local statistics will be sent to the County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A Times' reporter read the findings to directors of both museums last week before they had received the letters.\n\"I don't see that it's the business of the museum to start establishing quotas,\" said County Museum of Art Director Earl A. (Rusty) Powell tersely. \"The issue of quotas is not relevant to an educational institution devoted to quality and to the whole history of art.\"\nPowell said several women have recently been subjects of solo exhibits at the museum, including Eileen Cowan, Barbara Kruger, Maren Hassinger and Wendy MacNeil. He also noted the museum's 1977 group exhibit, \"Women Artists: 1550-1950.\"\nPowell acknowledged, however, that \"we have not had a major retrospective solo show of a woman artist; that would be true. But the museum has not excluded the work of women artists--the record certainly confirms that fact--and we never will.\"\nRichard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, said, \"This is a matter of great concern to us and a subject that plays a part in our decision-making process. We feel there's room for tremendous improvement and we will continue to improve that aspect of our programming.\"\nKoshalek also listed women artists who have had shows at the museum and said that next summer the museum will present a solo retrospective of about 50 works by Elizabeth Murray.\nNeiman said local WAVE participants hope to meet with Powell and Koshalek to discuss possible changes in the museums' representation of women artists. She suggested several artists for solo retrospective exhibits, from Georgia O'Keeffe to local artist Betye Saar.\nLos Angeles Times art writer Suzanne Muchnic, responding to the statistics, said, \"During my career as a critic, the situation has improved for women artists. Their work has become more adventurous, more prominently shown and more frequently reviewed. But our current coverage reflects the shows that are out there; we can't review exhibits that don't exist.\"\nHerald Examiner art critic Knight said, \"There's no question that women artists have an extremely tough time compared to male artists. But what bothers me is this approach. It adopts a kind of corporate, bottom-line mentality where you're looking at figures on paper and nothing else matters. It's addressing a cultural reality not through art but through business techniques.\"\nNot all the local caucus' findings were negative, however.\nResearchers found that from 1980 to 1986, 44% of all Municipal Art Gallery exhibits, group and solo, were devoted to women artists; that 43% of all shows at the County Museum's art rental gallery (which rents to museum members only) exhibited women artists' work, and 32% of all performance and video presentations from 1983 to 1986 at the Museum of Contemporary Art were women's works.\n\"There are people in Los Angeles giving really appropriate and significant attention to women artists,\" said Weisberg, who will deliver a speech Saturday.\nWeisberg, Neiman and local WAVE co-coordinator Cheri Gaulke all took part in a similar demonstration at the County Museum of Art in 1981. The trio was part of an ad-hoc committee, Artists Coalition for Equality, charging inequ",

(The 31-chapter caucus has about 4,000 members nationally--400 in Southern California--united to strengthen the role and status of women in art.) But WAVE organizers say this is the first demonstration of its type waged nationally.\n\"Our goal is to make people aware that progress has been uneven,\" Weisberg said, \"and to overcome the sense that the issue of inequality for women artists--and minority artists--is all in the past; that the problem has all been taken care of. We have made significant progress, but there is a lot more to accomplish.\"",

        "prompt": "ACCORDING to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, John Seigenthaler Sr. is 78 years old and the former editor of The Tennessean in Nashville. But is that information, or anything else in Mr. Seigenthaler's biography, true?\nThe question arises because Mr. Seigenthaler recently read about himself on Wikipedia and was shocked to learn that he \"was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John and his brother Bobby.\"\n\"Nothing was ever proven,\" the biography added.\nMr. Seigenthaler discovered that the false information had been on the site for several months and that an unknown number of people had read it, and possibly posted it on or linked it to other sites.\nIf any assassination was going on, Mr. Seigenthaler (who is 78 and did edit The Tennessean) wrote last week in an op-ed article in USA Today, it was of his character.\nThe case triggered extensive debate on the Internet over the value and reliability of Wikipedia, and more broadly, over the nature of online information.\nWikipedia is a kind of collective brain, a repository of knowledge, maintained on servers in various countries and built by anyone in the world with a computer and an Internet connection who wants to share knowledge about a subject. Literally hundreds of thousands of people have written Wikipedia entries.\nMistakes are expected to be caught and corrected by later contributors and users.\nThe whole nonprofit enterprise began in January 2001, the brainchild of Jimmy Wales, 39, a former futures and options trader who lives in St. Petersburg, Fla. He said he had hoped to advance the promise of the Internet as a place for sharing information.\nIt has, by most measures, been a spectacular success. Wikipedia is now the biggest encyclopedia in the history of the world. As of Friday, it was receiving 2.5 billion page views a month, and offering at least 1,000 articles in 82 languages. The number of articles, already close to two million, is growing by 7 percent a month. And Mr. Wales said that traffic doubles every four months.\nStill, the question of Wikipedia, as of so much of what you find online, is: Can you trust it?\nAnd beyond reliability, there is the question of accountability. Mr. Seigenthaler, after discovering that he had been defamed, found that his \"biographer\" was anonymous. He learned that the writer was a customer of BellSouth Internet, but that federal privacy laws shield the identity of Internet customers, even if they disseminate defamatory material. And the laws protect online corporations from libel suits.\nHe could have filed a lawsuit against BellSouth, he wrote, but only a subpoena would compel BellSouth to reveal the name.\nIn the end, Mr. Seigenthaler decided against going to court, instead alerting the public, through his article, \"that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool.\"\nMr. Wales said in an interview that he was troubled by the Seigenthaler episode, and noted that Wikipedia was essentially in the same boat. \"We have constant problems where we have people who are trying to repeatedly abuse our sites,\" he said.\nStill, he said, he was trying to make Wikipedia less vulnerable to tampering. He said he was starting a review mechanism by which readers and experts could rate the value of various articles. The reviews, which he said he expected to start in January, would show the site's strengths and weaknesses and perhaps reveal patterns to help them address the problems.\nIn addition, he said, Wikipedia may start blocking unregistered users from creating new pages, though they would still be able to edit them.\nThe real problem, he said, was the volume of new material coming in; it is so overwhelming that screeners cannot keep up with it.\nAll of this struck close to home for librarians and researchers. On an electronic mailing list for them, J. Stephen Bolhafner, a news researcher at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, wrote, \"The best defense of the Wikipedia, frankly, is to point out how much bad information is available from supposedly reliable sources.\"\nJessica Baumgart, a news researcher at Harvard University, wrote that there were librarians voluntarily working behind the scenes to check information on Wikipedia. \"But, honestly,\" she added, \"in some ways, we're just as fallible as everyone else in some areas because our own knowledge is limited and we can't possibly fact-check everything.\"\nIn an interview, she said that her rule of thumb was to double-check everything and to consider Wikipedia as only one source.\n\"Instead of figuring out how to 'fix' Wikipedia -- something that cannot be done to our satisfaction,\" wrote Derek Willis, a research database manager at The Washington Post, who was speaking for himself and not The Post, \"we should focus our energies on educating",
        "baseline": " the Wikipedia users among our colleagues.\"\n\"People will be defamed,\" he said. \"But that's the way free speech is. Think about the gossip world. It spreads. There's no way to correct it, period. Wikipedia is not immune from that kind of maliciousness, but it is, relative to other features of life, more easily corrected.\"\nIndeed, Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0 and a longtime Internet analyst, said Wikipedia may, in that sense, be better than real life.\n\"The Internet has done a lot more for truth by making things easier to discuss,\" she said. \"Transparency and sunlight are better than a single point of view that can't be questioned.\"\nFor Mr. Seigenthaler, whose biography on Wikipedia has since been corrected, the lesson is simple: \"We live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and research, but populated by volunteer vandals with poison-pen intellects.\"",

        "prompt": "CALGARY, April 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - TransAlta Corporation (\"TransAlta\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:TA) (NYSE: TAC) today issued a letter to shareholders and filed its management information circular (the \"Circular\") for its annual and special meeting of shareholders (the \"Meeting\") to be held on April 26, 2019.\nTransAlta encourages shareholders to read the Circular to gain insight into the extensive efforts undertaken to seek and reflect shareholder input, assess a wide range of strategic alternatives, engage constructively with shareholders, and secure an outstanding transaction with a leading global renewable energy investor and operator to advance its strategy. The Circular also addresses TransAlta's recent engagement with Mangrove Partners (\"Mangrove\") and Bluescape Energy Partners (\"Bluescape\"), which have notified the Company that they intend to nominate director candidates.\nTransAlta urges shareholders to vote the Blue proxy FOR TransAlta's director nominees in order to: (i) secure a strategic $750 million investment from Brookfield Renewable Partners, a world-class renewable energy investor and operator; (ii) strengthen TransAlta's ability to advance its strategy, invest in growth and accelerate the return of capital to shareholders; and (iii) add world-class renewable energy and capacity market expertise to its Board of Directors. A copy of the Circular can be downloaded from the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and the Company's EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. The Circular is also available at TransAlta's website.\n\"Over the past several years, TransAlta has successfully developed and implemented a strategy designed to navigate fundamental regulatory changes and a weak economy in our primary market, all while delivering record free cash flow, reducing debt, and continuing to grow the Company,\" said Ambassador Gordon Giffin, Chair of the TransAlta Board. \"Securing Brookfield's investment and expertise is a continuation of that work. It responds to the feedback we have received from our shareholders and gives us everything we need to accelerate our strategy to create significant and sustainable shareholder value.\"\n\"The market has reacted very favourably to our deal with Brookfield. It has the full support of RBC Global Asset Management, TransAlta's largest shareholder with a 12.4% stake in the Company, as well as the equity research analyst community,\" Ambassador Giffin continued. \"We believe shareholders should vote the Blue proxy in favour of TransAlta's Board nominees to protect these gains and all of the strategic benefits this investment provides.\"\n\"TransAlta's shareholders have been patient and supportive as we've transformed the Company. Now they deserve to reap the rewards. We urge shareholders to move forward rather than backwards. We are poised to deliver compelling value, whereas Mangrove and Bluescape represent risk and uncertainty, at best,\" said Ambassador Giffin.\nTransAlta has successfully navigated challenging external market conditions since 2015, when the Alberta Government introduced policies to shut down coal by 2030, impose a significant carbon tax, and targeted 5,000 MW of additional renewables into an already oversupplied market. This coincided with a period of historically low power prices in Alberta, a weak Alberta economy, significant competition for new assets and weak capital market conditions.\nIn the face of these challenges, TransAlta developed a long-term strategy to create value by achieving 100% clean energy by 2025, converting 100% of its Alberta coal fleet to natural gas, unlocking the value of the Company's hydro assets, investing in long-term contracted gas and renewable projects, reducing its operating costs and maintaining a strong balance sheet. TransAlta has made progress towards each of these goals and has significantly outperformed the TSX Capped Utility index when measured on a three- and one-year basis.\nHarry Goldgut is a Vice Chair in Brookfield's Renewable Power and Infrastructure Groups. Mr. Goldgut has been responsible for the acquisition of the majority of Brookfield's renewable power assets and has played a role in the restructuring of the electricity market in Ontario as a member of the Electricity Market Design Committee and the Clean Energy Task Force.\nRichard Legault is a Vice Chair in Brookfield's Renewable Group, Vice Chair in Brookfield Asset Management and served as the CEO of Brookfield Renewable Partners until August 2015. During his 28 years at Brookfield, Mr. Legault led the development and expansion of Brookfield's renewable business in North and South America, as well as in Europe. He also served as CFO at Brookfield Asset Management from 2000 to 2001.\nRobert C. Flexon was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Dynegy Inc. from 2011 until its acquisition by Vistra Energy Corp. in April 2018. Dynegy Inc. was a U.S. independent power producer engaged in the operation of power generating facilities and listed on the NYSE. Mr. Flexon brings a wealth of skills and experience with independent power producers, thermal generation, capital markets, accounting, finance, tax and risk management.\nEach of the nominees brings exceptional and highly relevant expertise to TransAlta. The fact that Mr. Goldgut and Mr. Legault have been nominated by Brookfield as part of its cornerstone investment in the Company is a significant benefit of the transaction. TransAlta would add these two directors under any scenario, simply for their expertise and enormous knowledge of renewable energy assets and the Canadian market. The addition of Mr. Flexon further enhances our Board's strength, particularly as we execute our coal-to-gas conversion strategy.\nThese nominations continue a pattern of Board renewal at TransAlta. Including the three new nominee directors, the Board will have added eight new directors in the past five years. TransAlta notes and appreciates the positive endorsement that Bluescape Executive Chairman C. John Wilder gave in recent correspondence about the quality of the new TransAlta Board nominees.\nTogether with the three new director nominees described above, TransAlta's Board has the right mix of skills, capabilities, experience and market knowledge to provide effective oversight and direction to the Company's strategy and ongoing successful efforts to drive shareholder value creation. The Board nominees' expertise includes renewable and thermal operational capability, as well as public markets, environmental, technology, legal, regulatory, governmental affairs, engineering and technical expertise. The exceptional qualifications of our Board members have been proven through the significant leadership positions they have held as officers and/or directors at very sizable, publicly-traded companies with complex operations.\nTransAlta's Circular details the Board's extensive engagement program over the past three years with many of the Company's largest institutional shareholders. The purpose of these discussions was to gauge Shareholders' support for, and input into, our strategies and to discuss possible strategic investments, financings or other transactions or events to unlock TransAlta's value. The sum and substance of this feedback was that investors are supportive of the Company's strategy, but wanted to see more action taken to accelerate the implementation of the Company's plan. The insight gained from this engagement is one of the factors that compelled the Board to seize the opportunity to secure the Brookfield transaction when it did.\nThe Circular also describes TransAlta's relationship with Brookfield, which has been an operating partner on a BC hydro facility since 2009 and a meaningful shareholder of TransAlta for over four years. As with all of the Company's major shareholders, TransAlta has had discussions with Brookfield throughout this period on a variety of topics. Of particular note, Brookfield's recent investment was informed by extensive prior discussions and due diligence over the past three years with Brookfield (and other potential investors) aimed at a wide range of strategies for enhancing the long-term value potential of the Company's hydro and coal assets, as well as the value of the Company as a whole, including through potential sale transactions. As a result, Brookfield was very familiar with TransAlta and its hydro assets, and TransAlta knew Brookfield could be an outstanding partner to help fund and implement the Company's value creation strategy.\nTransAlta welcomes constructive shareholder engagement and has had numerous discussions with Mangrove and Bluescape since they emerged as TransAlta shareholders in recent months. In the course of these discussions, as detailed in the Circular, Mangrove and Bluescape supported Mr. Flexon as a candidate for election to the Board, and rejected an offer to also have Bluescape Executive Chairman C. John Wilder join the TransAlta Board. Mangrove and Bluescape subsequently submitted a term sheet demanding, among other things, that the Company issue to Mr. Wilder C$150 million in common shares at a 6% discount to the market price, based on a 21-day volume weighted average. This was a demand that no board could reasonably accept.\nAmbassador Giffin added, \"Had the dissidents accepted our offer, Mr. Wilder would have a seat at the Board table. Instead, they notified the Company of their intention to nominate five new directors, which suggests they are seeking the ability to terminate the Brookfield investment and implement the playbook they have used at other companies of selling renewable energy assets and doubling down on coal-fired generation, which is a dead-end strategy and something we will not do.\"\nTransAlta cautions shareholders that a potential slate of dissident nominees from Mangrove and Bluescape threatens to disrupt TransAlta's strategic direction by: (i) terminating Brookfield's investment, and all the value and expertise that comes with it; (ii) abandoning TransAlta's move towards clean energy by retrenching to coal, or to go in search of potential alternative transactions, a process that could take months or years with no assurance of producing anything of greater – or even similar – value; and (iii) adding further risk and delay to returning meaningful value to TransAlta shareholders who have supported the Company throughout its strategic transformation.\nIn a March 29, 2019 press release, Mangrove and Bluescape ask: \"Is the Brookfield Investment in the best interests of all TransAlta shareholders?\" The answer is a resounding \"yes\" – and all evidence indicates that the market agrees. In the four trading days following the announcement of the deal, TransAlta's share price increased by more than 9% and equity research analysts have published favourable commentaries and increased their consensus 12-month price target for TransAlta's stock by 24%.\nIn addition to the benefits outlined above, the investment is structured to enable TransAlta shareholders to participate in the future value of the Company's hydro assets through both the deferred sale arrangement (i.e., post 2024) and through the retention of at least 51% of the Hydro portfolio. The structure is significantly more accretive than potential alternatives, such as issuing equity at the current share price (which would dilute existing shareholders at sub-optimal value), selling an interest in the Company's coal-to-gas assets which are central to the Company's long-term strategy, or weakening the balance sheet through excess borrowing, which would inhibit the execution of TransAlta's value-creation strategy and not be in the best long-term interests of the Company or its shareholders. Furthermore, Brookfield is aligned with shareholder interests through its position as a long-standing significant investor in the Company, as well as through Board nominations and the associated fiduciary duties of its nominees to TransAlta and its shareholders. Brookfield has committed to purchase TransAlta common shares in the open market to increase its share ownership in TransAlta to 9% subject to certain conditions, and TransAlta and Brookfield will form a joint operating committee to focus on optimizing the operations and maximizing the value of the Company's hydro assets.\nAs it relates to the value of TransAlta's Hydro assets, the 13x EBITDA multiple used in the transaction to value the future cash flows from TransAlta's Hydro assets is in line with analyst estimates and is consistent with the 10x – 16.3x multiples for precedent merchant hydro transactions that involve selling 100% of the assets (whereas Brookfield will only have rights to acquire a minority interest). Higher multiples may be observed in control transactions in markets that are more liquid, more contracted based on higher capacity or power prices or more interconnected with neighbouring markets than Alberta, but that is not where TransAlta's hydro assets are located. In addition, Brookfield is paying 13x the future EBITDA in the future, after the PPA expires, when TransAlta expects the assets to generate significantly more EBITDA than they do currently. All other precedent transactions are based on current EBITDA.\nFinally, the Brookfield investment will be highly accretive for TransAlta shareholders as it will permit TransAlta to repurchase up to $250 million of shares through a substantial issuer bid and its normal course issuer bid program.\nTransAlta's single largest shareholder, RBC Global Asset Management, is supportive of our strategic partnership with, and the investment by, Brookfield. RBC has committed to vote all of the common shares under its direction or control, representing 12.4% of TransAlta's outstanding common shares, FOR the election of all of TransAlta's director nominees at the Meeting, as well as in favour of the other items of annual and special business that shareholders are being asked to consider at the upcoming Meeting.\nBrookfield, which currently owns approximately 4.9% of TransAlta's outstanding common shares, also plans to vote FOR the election of all of TransAlta's director nominees at the Meeting, as well as in favour of the other items of annual and special business that shareholders are being asked to consider at the Meeting.\nTransAlta asks shareholders to read the Circular carefully and to vote the BLUE proxy FOR all 12 TransAlta director nominees at our upcoming Meeting on April 26, 2019. Shareholder support is critical as we work to build a foundation for long-term, sustainable value creation as a leading clean energy company.\nA vote FOR TransAlta's director nominees will be a vote to realize the value of TransAlta's diverse and quality assets for decades to come, a vote for an experienced and engaged Board and a vote to share in the upside of TransAlta. Becoming a voter is fast and easy. To support TransAlta's Board, vote only your BLUE proxy or voting instruction form today.\nIf you have any questions about the Meeting, please contact Kingsdale Advisors, TransAlta's strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent, by telephone at 1-877-659-1820 (toll-free in North America) or 1-416-867-2272 (collect outside North America) or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.\nTransAlta owns, operates and develops a diverse fleet of electrical power generation assets in Canada, the United States and Australia with a focus on long-term shareholder value.

        "prompt": "In Pakist­an where litera­cy rate is to be nearly 50 per cent, many questi­on the effica­cy of digita­l media.\nKARACHI: In a country where the literacy rate is estimated at only slightly above half of the entire population and the lowest 40 per cent have less than one-fourth share in total household income, many question the efficacy of digital media as part of the marketing mix.\nBut that is the exact perception Symmetry Digital is determined to change with the launch of Digital Minds – a competition initiated by the company to inculcate the ‘digital mindset’ at grassroots level.\nThe competition, an industry initiative spanning over the next two months, targets the youth of Karachi in a bid that once the students involved in the contest graduate from universities and join the workforce, they will be able to act as catalysts for the promotion of digital marketing – a ‘smarter, cheaper and more measurable’ choice for advertisers, according to one expert.\n“The concept of digital media has been completely misunderstood in Pakistan,” said Adil Ahmed, the Chief Operating Officer of Symmetry Digital. He explained that people assume that the digital medium is restricted to the internet and fail to take into account other platforms – mobile phones, for example.\nCellular subscriptions have crossed the 99 million mark during the last financial year. “People do not realise this but the number of Facebook users in Pakistan has also increased to 2.5 million from the mere 0.25 million recorded in December 2008,” highlighted Ahmed.\nHowever, according to the man behind one of the largest digital media agencies in the country, the mindset in Pakistan has not been able to evolve beyond the traditionally accepted mediums of marketing. “Since digital marketing is not being properly taught at local universities, the market cannot move beyond a certain penetration point,” contended Ahmed.\nHe may have a point as even the handful of courses that are taught on the subject focus on e-commerce and the internet. ‘Out-of-home’ digital platforms, for instance, are unheard of in Pakistan. These include interactive LED screens and augmented digital kiosks among other innovative mechanisms to communicate with the target market.\nHence, Digital Minds aims to fill the void by offering participants the opportunity to design innovative marketing plans that are either solely based on digital media or rely on it heavily.\n“The most important aspect of digital media is the ability to target a specific market,” declared the head of online strategy at a local media group.\nMeanwhile, Ahmed termed the digital medium much more ‘measurable’ than, for example, television. “While we",
        "baseline": " are not pushing for a complete digitisation of advertising, it must be realised that a suitable marketing mix is essential to achieve the desired results,” he maintained.\nWith companies constantly seeking to cut costs, reassessing the feasibility of above-the-line advertising tools deserves merit as not only are these techniques more expensive, their results are very difficult to measure since potential customers are targeted across the board, in a blanket attempt to capture attention.\nAlthough there exists tremendous potential to capitalise on demographic data collected through digital interfaces, Ahmed pointed out that many companies in Pakistan have not made the effort to boost sales by tracking behavioural characteristics or psychographics.\n“It is estimated by many that less than two per cent of the entire advertising expenditure is incurred on online campaigns – although there is no empirical research to back this figure,” he concluded.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2010.\nMedia insiders expect cut-throat competition in the English print media market.",

The winner will be awarded a cash prize of Rs100,000 and a trophy while the runner-up will receive Rs50,000 and a trophy.\nThe competition will be held in two phases.

        "prompt": "Broadcom this week announced new chips designed to create a low-cost 802.11n wireless LAN edge for the enterprise, without the need for separate WLAN controllers.\nThe two highly integrated chips are designed for 11n access points that will cost about the same as today's enterprise 11a/b/g devices, and for an edge switch that can handle both wireless and wired clients, eliminating the conventional controller-based architecture that is the foundation of most WLANs today.\nThis trend toward a unified edge switch for wireless and wired clients has been talked about for more than two years but has gained little traction. The development was sparked by emerging silicon products from Broadcom, SiNett and Marvel, and by software from NextHop (since acquired by U4EA). D-Link introduced a unified edge switch in May 2008 based on the NextHop code running on Marvel chips.\nThe premise is that by collapsing separate wired and wireless networks into one at the edge, enterprise IT gains by simplifying network deployments, operations and management, and by lowering both capital costs and total cost of ownership.\nThe new Broadcom chips come at time when two key developments are intersecting. First, 802.11n, with 300Mbps data rates per radio, is moving into large-scale enterprise deployments, offering 5- to 8-times the throughput of 802.11b/g networks. Second, some enterprises that have deployed wall-to-wall WLANs are now discovering that most of their existing -- and expensive -- wired ports are lying idle, as end users rely almost completely on the WLAN for network access. This trend is triggering intense debate, as the reader comments about our recent story on this trend make clear.\nBroadcom's BCM4748 chip supports a 2x2 MIMO configuration for 802.11n access points, using the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and running with standard 802.3af power over Ethernet. It's designed as a \"system on a chip\" and integrates all the 802.11n components, along with Broadcom's enhancements to create a more robust signal, with the latest MIPS32 533MHz processing core, a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC controller, on-board SRAM, 802.1x and WPA and WPA2 for enterprise-class security, USB 2.0 host ports, and power amplifiers.\nUsing the new chip, manufacturers can slash the overall bill-of-material costs by 30% to 35%, says Michael Powell, senior product line manger for Broadcom's enterprise switching group. \"What we're really look at are [final] cost points for dual-concurrent 11",

He cites market research data as putting those list prices in the $300 to 400 range, with comparable 11n access points considerably more expensive.\nThe new unified switch silicon is the BCM56520, which supports CAPWAP tunneling to attached WLAN access points, and up to 28 Gigabit Ethernet ports, or 24 such ports and four Broadcom HiGig ports (which support Broadcom's protocol for high-capacity interconnections with other Broadcom systems). It's about the same price as the previous chip but with far greater capacity to handle 11n data rates, according to Powell.\nThe package also includes the latest version of Broadcom's FastPath Unified Wireless Switching systems software.\nThe products are sampling now with equipment makers, who could introduce access points and switches based on them by the end of 2009 and into 2010.",

In a brief statement sent to media, the former World Cup-winning player and coach, who is a key figure in an affair involving an alleged slush fund used to bribe FIFA voting members back in 2000 to award the tournament to Germany, again said the Germans never bought votes. \"In order to get a subsidy from FIFA (for the organisation of the 2006 World Cup) those involved went ahead with a proposal from the FIFA finance commission that in today's eyes should have been rejected.

Gunmen from ISIS allegedly assassinated Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade (ASMB) leader Nasser al-Aker, who was a senior member of the al-Qaeda-associated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).\nThe Mujahedeen Shura Council of Derna (MSC Derna), an umbrella group controlled by ASMB, released a statement declaring jihad on ISIS in Derna soon after the assassination. Clashes erupted across the city. Anti-ISIS forces cleared ISIS from central Derna and captured ISIS's headquarters on June 13, despite ISIS's defensive deployment of multiple SVBIEDs. ISIS now holds no territory inside the city.\nSocial media reports from activists within Derna indicate strong local animosity towards ISIS. Derna's residents organized demonstrations against ISIS on June 11 and 12, and according to unconfirmed rumors may have been armed by ASMB to participate in military operations against ISIS.\nAfter ISIS's expulsion, MSC Derna released statements announcing the reopening of a hospital, the creation of a program to return stolen cars, and plans for a municipal council, likely in an attempt to replace ISIS's governance efforts. This development demonstrates the ability of local groups likely to capitalize on discontent within ISIS's areas of control to undermine the organization.\nISIS's expulsion is especially striking because Derna contains historically strong extremist networks, some of which have ties to ISIS. Records captured from ISIS's predecessor al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2007 revealed that Derna contributed more foreign fighters per capita to AQI than any other city.\nDerna natives associated with ISIS in Syria returned to Libya in 2014 and formed the Majlis Shura Shabab al-Islam group, which later took control of Derna. These militants administered sharia law, conducted public executions, and provided basic services in all areas of the city. The group publicly declared its allegiance to ISIS's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October 2014, and ISIS recognized it as an official affiliate in November 2014.\nISIS is executing a coherent global strategy that involves defending its territory within Iraq and Syria, establishing affiliates within the Middle East and North Africa, and encouraging terror attacks in the wider world.\nISIS's regional affiliates, or wilayats, allow the organization to claim success even when it suffers losses within Iraq and Syria. ISIS also uses its regional affiliates to exacerbate local and regional conflicts in order to facilitate the organization's expansion beyond Iraq and Syria in the long term.\nISIS's regional efforts have been most successful in Libya, where the group controls terrain, administers governance, and operates militant training camps. ISIS's leadership now encourages fighters who cannot travel to Iraq and Syria to fight in Libya instead.\nISIS seeks to exacerbate the Libyan conflict and seize terrain where Libya's rival governments are unable to prevent the group's expansion.

In the video, Fultz can be seen going three-for-four at the line, including one shot that clanks the front of the rim and gets a friendly roll and a miss that is well right and barely hits the rim at all.\nHowever, even more worrisome than the miss is the ugly shooting form. Fultz still has a noticeable hitch as he jerks on his release -- an issue that has plagued the rookie since preseason.\nThe ugly jumper has been noticeable for weeks and Fultz doesn't appear to be any closer to fixing it.\nFultz's ugly shooting form is a stark contrast to his jumper while at Washington. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 23.2 points on 47.6% shooting from the field and 41% from three-point range in his lone collegiate season.\nIn his four games played with the Sixers, Fultz shot just 33% from the field and 50% from the free-throw line. He did not attempt a three-pointer.\nThe issue of Fultz's broken jump shot initially stems from shoulder soreness the rookie first experienced in preseason. Fultz's agent told reporters the point guard received a cortisone shot in his right shoulder in early October. Since then, the Sixers have been working on fixing his shooting mechanics. Nearly four months later and it appears the problem with his jumper is still nowhere near to being resolved.\nSixers coach Brett Brown didn't exactly give the most optimistic outlook when it comes to Fultz's broken jumper.\n\"I",

It has made me stronger and it has given me hope.\"\nSaliu said: \"Every woman should stand up for her children and do whatever is necessary to protect them from something like this.\"\nSaliu said she fled Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother told her she would get her oldest daughter, Bassy, cut.

        "prompt": "St. Paul-based West Side Community Health Services has a new name: Minnesota Community Care. Its role as a \"beacon of hope\" is the same.\nReuben Moore grew up a patient of community health centers and he now leads the state’s largest as CEO of St. Paul-based West Side Community Health Services.\nAs of Jan. 1, West Side has a new name: Minnesota Community Care. Its role as a “beacon of hope” is the same as it has been since its 1969 founding, Moore said.\nWith 400 employees and 17 locations, it serves 40,000 unique patients annually. Moore joined in October 2017, bringing nearly 20 years of health insurance and health care experience from Mayo Clinic, UnitedHealth Group, Humana and elsewhere.\nHe’s instituting Mayo-style team-based patient care at primary care sites, among other changes. Forty-three percent of Minnesota Community Care’s patients are uninsured, Moore said, although those with private insurance increasingly are visiting.\nQ: What is community health?\nA: Community health centers specialize in delivering localized primary-care services regardless of socioeconomic status. These services are tailored to the communities we serve. The value proposition is built upon high-quality clinical care that is affordable, comprehensive, culturally competent and complemented with enabling services that wrap around our patients to help reduce health access barriers and positively impact social determinants of health.\nQ: Where do patients travel from and why?\nA: They’re coming from all over: Michigan, Oklahoma, all over Minnesota, Wisconsin, North and South Dakota, Iowa. We’re probably the most affordable in terms of a sliding fee scale. Then there’s our cultural competency and legacy around serving diverse communities who have barriers to health access.\nQ: How do you work with insured patients?\nA: If you’re on commercial insurance and have a tough month we can move your bill down to where it’s affordable. Health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and it’s impacting more than just in the low-income brackets.\nQ: What services do your locations offer?\nA: Primary services, pharmacy, lab, radiology. Social workers, patient reps who can help get you enrolled in MNsure. Chiropractic. We have an ambulatory clinic. Specialty services: an HIV/AIDS clinic. Chronic-condition management. Emergency procedure rooms. Behavioral health and mental health. Nutritionists, community health workers, doulas. We carry probably the most interpreters for an organization our size: 17. We have 50-plus languages in the community. The billing department works with patients on affordability. You can get it all in a one-stop shop.\nQ: What changes are you making in addition to team-based care?\nA: We added a new site in downtown St. Paul. We intend to open a state-of-the art clinic in partnership with Catholic Charities in St. Paul. It will be the best for those with the least. I think that will be our future concept. We’re remodeling the La Clinica site [on St. Paul’s West Side]. We’re going to add more community health workers and health educators [in schools]. We had one mental health professional at each of our schools, and I said that’s not enough. So all of these things are being redeployed into our school-based clinics.\nQ: How challenging is it to get resources for new and expanded programs and locations?\nA: The economic challenges are intense. To provide the services to the community that the community needs we have to make trade-offs. Sometimes it requires us to be lean in other areas and cut costs in areas that are still important and hope that the reimbursement curve will catch up. But we are making those trade-offs today with the bet that we’ll improve in our patient experience and our volume tomorrow and be able to argue for a different way to be reimbursed in the future. It’s a risky bet, but we think we’re following the best clinical and evidence-based medicine and public health guidance.\nQ: What brought you to Minnesota Community Care?\nA: I wanted to get closer to care. It was somewhat serendipitous. I helped Mayo Clinic sell its health plan management company, which I was leading. In the same month of the deal closing, a recruiter reached out to me for this role.\nQ: What was your experience with community health care centers?\nA: I went to Washburn High School in Minneapolis. I hadn’t had dental care in maybe eight years or so, and my teeth had been hurting for two years. I",

Thanks to community health centers I’ve still got great teeth.\nQ: What does the future hold for Minnesota Community Care?\nA: For 50 years, we have been an innovative leader in community-based, primary care services across our great state of Minnesota. For the next 50 years, we will continue this legacy by expanding our sites, improving our team-based care delivery model, partnering to better impact social determinants of health and relocating our brand as a beacon of community care, hope and healing for those in need of health care access.",

A group of young Muslim Shiites of Najaf attend Mass in the capital and have lunch with the patriarch. Several Baghdad streets festooned with Christmas trees.\nBaghdad (AsiaNews) - In Iraq we are witnessing \" grass roots revolt against terrorism, against violence\", accompanied by a renewed commitment to the \"defense of life, of peace, of joy\"; in this way \"it is possible to defeat those who seek death, destruction, emigration”, the Chaldean Patriarch Mar Raphael Louis Sako tells AsiaNews, describing the festive atmosphere these days in the country, despite episodes of violence.\nAmong the many events that have marked these days of celebration, the Chaldean primate cites three examples: Christmas trees scattered around different neighborhoods in Baghdad; the visit of a group of young Najafdi Shiite Muslims who attended a mass in the capital; the celebrations for the new year in Basra and the invitation of local authorities to Christians, \"to return to their homes.\"\n\"New Year's Eve – says Mar Sako - I went out to go to a square in the Mansour neighborhood of Baghdad. We celebrated with a lot of people, nearly a million people took to the streets. \" \"We talked with them, we exchanged greetings; these are small things - but are important to reject the Daesh ideology of terror \"[Arabic acronym of the Islamic state] who still target the capital with attacks.\nThe \"change\" is visible, continues the Chaldean Patriarch, \"especially in Baghdad, dotted with Christmas trees. And then the many letters of greeting from religious, political authorities, but also of Muslim civil activists and many ordinary people. \" \"I think 2017 - he said - will be another year, maybe not total peace, but certainly greater cohesion, unity. This is my prayer, but it is also the common feeling of the majority of citizens \".\nBasra’s political, religious and institutional authorities have launched an appeal to Christians, asking the many who have emigrated to return to their homes. In the southern Iraqi city New Year's Eve was also celebrated for the first time, demonstrating a greater climate \"cohesion\" among the different souls that make up the local situation and the whole country. The police forces in Basra kept watch so that the celebrations and the festivities were held in complete safety; the County Council has also committed itself to the maintenance and renovation of churches.\n\"The governor and the president of the Municipal Council - Mar Sako continues - came to visit me in these days of celebration. A local Christian politician circulated a letter for the New Year against the war. We Christians have a lot to do for the local community; I asked the local authorities to show their closeness to the Christian communities, and these appeals and these initiatives [at Christmas] is a first response. \" The most significant event of these days, believes Mar Sako, is the visit of a group of young Muslims, boys and girls, originating in Najaf, Shiite Muslims, who attended a mass in the church of St. George. Afterwards, the group had lunch with the patriarch of the Chaldean Church and other members of the executive exchanging stories and personal and community experiences. \"They took part in the church service - recalls the primate Chaldean - and then we posed for photographs with a flag of Iraq and banners for peace.

They have seen a few dedicated services to our community in the media, and they wanted to meet us, creating a personal and direct relationship with us that I hope will continue in the future. Here, from this we can also see the importance of newspapers and TV to provide opportunities for interaction and discussion.

        "prompt": "That's not a hypothetical question. Falling gas prices mean the average household will be about $700 richer this year.\nFor most Americans, trying to cut back on bills involves a mix of discipline and sacrifice: Moving into a smaller place, searching for sales at the grocery store, or forgoing air conditioning on hot days, for examples. But drivers around the country have been getting a reprieve without any effort thanks to falling gas prices. So what are they doing with the unanticipated bonus in their bank accounts? Not saving it, a new report from J.P. Morgan finds.\nThe price of gas peaked at about $3.70 a gallon in 2014. At present, that price has declined by about $1.50. While those single-gallon prices might seem insignificant, they add up. Take the example of a Toyota Camry, one of the nation’s top-selling cars with a fuel tank that holds around 17 gallons: Filling a totally empty tank at the peak would cost over $60. Now it would cost a much more reasonable $37. And for those who rely on their car as the main method of transportation, that’s a big deal. It’s been estimated that over the course of 2015, Americans will save on average $700 thanks to the dip in gas prices. That’s more than government stimulus checks in recent years, which paid out between $300 and $600.\nAnd they’re spending it—most of it, at least. According to the J.P. Morgan Institute, Americans are spending about 80 cents for every dollar they’ve saved. They’re going out to restaurants—which accounted for nearly 20 percent of gas savings—shopping for clothes, and buying groceries, electronics, and appliances.\nThese findings imply that Americans are feeling surprisingly upbeat about the economy. Were they more pessimistic, economists would expect them to be saving a greater portion of the money for the expected tough times ahead, or using the money strictly for essentials, like housing and bills. Other recent reports on the impact of lowered gas prices have painted a less optimistic picture. The Council of Economic Advisors puts the consumption bump at closer to 45 percent of gas savings, and a Gallup poll found that though nearly 60 percent of respondents said they’re feeling the positive effects of lower prices, only about one-quarter said that that they were spending the extra money. The bulk of respondents told Gallup that the money was going toward bills or savings.\nSo what explains the difference? The study’s authors, Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig note that these discrepancies could be related to sample size or more limited data in those surveys. In their study, J.P. Morgan analyzes the spending of 25 million clients via transactions on debit and credit cards between October 2012 and June 2015. While that certainly is a robust sample, it too has its own limitations and biases. For instance the bank’s data won’t capture transactions made with cash or on other credit or debit cards, which could be money that families are using for essentials rather than a night out or a new television. The data could also be skewed to reflect the habits and demographics of the bank’s clientele. For instance, the survey finds that gas bills account for only 2.9 percent of individual’s incomes in 2014 while the Consumer Expenditure Survey reports that it accounts for 3.7 percent, which could reflect a difference between where these sample groups live, their access to public transportation, or their income.\nNonetheless, some of the broad trends are intriguing. The data show that the gas-price infusion is obviously not spread equally among all Americans. It’s more heavily concentrated among those who live in the South and",

The savings are also more meaningful for low-income households—who saw their monthly disposable income climb by more than 1 percent for those pulling in less than $30,000 a year—and young people.\nThough the money spent on gas makes up a nominal amount of consumption in the grand scheme, the impact of gas prices on American families can be a telling way to assess how confident people are feeling about spending. It could also help predict spending trends should prices hold steady, or increase in the future. That could help inform policy decisions on things like gas taxes. For an economy that’s been puttering along with little wage growth, increasing costs of living, and little disposable income—spending is a good thing. It puts more money into businesses, which then creates more jobs and helps spur further economic growth. And there hasn’t been quite enough of that since 2008.",

        "prompt": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU on Wednesday offered Britain a free trade deal for their post-Brexit ties that fell well short of ambitions set out by Prime Minister Theresa May last week, notably for the country’s dominant financial sector.\nIn a draft seen by Reuters, the remaining 27 European Union members said they wanted a close partnership with Britain, but its depth would be limited by Britain’s own wish to leave the bloc’s single market and the customs union.\n“Because of Brexit, we will be drifting apart,” the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk told a news conference, delivering a message that contrasted sharply with May’s call for future trade to be as “frictionless as possible”.\nTusk said that, while he understood May’s goal to make Brexit a success for Britain, that was not the EU’s objective.\nCrucially, the bloc said Britain would be treated like any other third country when it came to financial services - which London had pressed to be included in the future deal.\nFinancial services generate more than 10 percent of Britain’s economic output and are the only area in which it has a trade surplus with the EU, making London very keen to preserve its banks’ current access to continental Europe.\nIn a sign some large banks may be losing patience with the protracted uncertainty about the future, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks.\nThat is one of the first tangible signs that banks are starting to act on Brexit contingency plans to keep what the EU calls passporting rights - the possibility to offer services to all EU clients via just one local license.\nBritish finance minister Philip Hammond called the EU guidelines a very tough position that any skilled negotiator would start with.\nWhile the EU says it does not want to mete out punishment Britain, the trade deal offer will come as another blow to Britain. The bloc has also recently outlined its contingency plans for avoiding an Irish border after Brexit, which Britain said would undermine its constitutional sovereignty.\nWith no passporting rights for its banks, the best option London can hope for is regulatory equivalence, under which they can get more access to the EU market if British financial rules, though not identical to EU ones, are seen by the bloc as achieving the same goals.\nBut Hammond said the EU’s third country equivalence regime would be wholly inadequate, and criticized the only patchy access it gives, as well as the possibility of revoking it at short notice.\nHe said a better solution would be mutual recognition and reciprocal equivalence, with sensible notice periods.\nHe also argued that Britain and the EU could reach a much better agreement on financial services than the EU had reached with Canada.

        "prompt": "Last year, this writer looked at the Massy Group of Companies formerly Neal and Massy to gain an understanding of the operations of this company which has been doing business in Guyana for the past 48 years. Given the integral role that the company plays in the Guyana economy, it is worth taking another look at its performance for the financial year 2015 to update one’s understanding of a company which has quietly expanded its operations through the years and is penetrating a growing number of sectors in the country. For those who might not know, Massy before the rebranding exercise in 2014 was in existence for 82 years under the name of Neal and Massy. The company has its headquarters in Trinidad and Tobago and came about as a result of a merger between Neal Engineering Company and Massy Limited in 1932. One outcome of the merger was the establishment of a public company in 1958. Another was the establishment of a subsidiary in Guyana in 1968. It is to the latter that interest will turn eventually in this article.\nOver the years, Massy has remained steadfast in its participation in the Guyana economy. But the growth of the company was not only focused on Guyana. Massy undertook several initiatives to expand its operations, including the expansion into other territories in the Caribbean and the diversification of products and services offered to its customers. As a consequence, the Massy Group is today a large conglomerate that is organized as business segments or business units that cover the range of products and services offered by the company in several countries in the North American and Latin American and Caribbean regions. Despite being in Guyana for 48 years, very little is said or discussed about a company that has been integral to the expansion and alteration of the Guyana economy for a very long time. It is for this reason that this column, once again, seeks to examine the role and place of this organization in Guyana.\nBefore narrowing the focus, it would be useful to present the business architecture of the company. It will help to create a sense of the importance of Massy’s operations in Guyana to the group as a whole. The Massy Group continues to operate as a complex business consisting of six business units, six subsidiaries and three associate companies that conduct operations in 11 countries. In four of the 11 locations, it has one product line while it has multiple product lines in the rest. For example, Massy operates a distribution service in Miami in the United States of America (USA). It operates an insurance service in Curaçao and a retail service in St Vincent and the Grenadines. It also operates a technical support service in Suriname. The remaining countries in which multiple operations take place are Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Colombia, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad & Tobago.\nThe business units cut across several economic sectors and remain the core of its operations. The business units consist of the Automotive and Industrial Equipment unit which controls eight separate companies that sell cars to consumers and heavy equipment to businesses. Then there is the Energy and Industrial Gases Business Unit which controls 18 companies with a similar market focus. The Insurance Unit comprises one company while the Information Technology and Communications Business Unit has control over 10 companies. The Integrated Retail Unit has control over 14 companies. The Finance segment also has six companies in its portfolio. The six business units not only reflect the structure of the organization, they also reflect the business strategy of the entity. Some of the business units have expanded their services or added new services to their portfolio. For example, Massy Communications has extended its business to business Internet and TV service to its consumer market.\nThe Lucas Stock Index (LSI) rose 0.54 per cent during the third period of trading in June 2016. The stocks of six companies were traded with 79,573 shares changing hands. There were three Climbers and one Tumbler. The stocks of Banks DIH (DIH) rose 1.98 per cent on the sale of 18,757 while the stocks of Demerara Distillers Limited (DDL) rose 5.26 per cent on the sale of 41,667 shares. In addition, the stocks of Demerara Tobacco Company (DTC) rose 1.51 per cent on the sale of 13,603 shares. In contrast, the stocks of Demerara Bank Limited (DBL) fell 5.26 per cent on the sale of 4,324 shares. In the meanwhile, the stocks of Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry (BTI) and Republic Bank Limited (RBL) remained unchanged on the sale of 222 and 1,000 shares respectively.\nAs part of its overall strategy, the Massy Group has developed two sets of markets. The Group has dissected its market into business and consumer segments and uses them to deliver its products and services to users. The dual market strategy remains the dominant strategy of the company and is practised in seven of the 11 countries. For the Caricom region, this would be Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, St Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. For Latin America, this would be Colombia. One market is for business customers while the other is for consumers. The automotive, finance, insurance and retail businesses were directed at consumers while the industrial equipment, industrial gases, distribution and logistics, and the technology businesses were directed at other businesses. Now, Internet and TV services are also reaching household customers.\nGuyana is one of the five countries in which Massy has substantial investments. In fact, it is the third most important geographic market for the company when measured in assets, sales revenue and profits. Before discussing Guyana’s importance to the company, it remains important for readers to understand how Guyana fits into the overall Massy structure.\nGuyana was the earliest market into which Massy ventured as a foreign investor. The company came to Guyana in 1968 as Neal and Massy 10 years after it went public. At the time of Neal and Massy’s entry, Guyana was two years into its independence. The arrival of Neal and Massy saw the establishment of Associated Industries Limited (Ainlim). In a short history of itself, Massy reported that after its first 20 years in Guyana, the entity had control of four businesses. These were Ainlim, Demerara Oxygen Company (Docol), Transport Services and Demerara Property Investments. In its second 20 years, Massy made further adjustments to its portfolio in Guyana. During this latter period, Massy added Complete Computer Services, NM Services and NM Security. The Massy organization went through a rebranding exercise which resulted in all its companies carrying the Massy name alone. As such Ainlim is now known as Massy Industries, Docol is now known as Massy Gas while Transportation Services is now known as Massy Trading and Distribution. Complete Computer Services is known as Massy Technologies and NM Services is called Massy Services. One other company, NM Security, is now called Massy Security.\nEach of the above companies is part of a larger business unit. Massy Industries is part of the Automotive and Industrial Engineering business unit. Its market focus is on other businesses in Guyana and provides capital assets. Massy Industries therefore serve the business community in Guyana. Massy Gas operates under the Energy and Industrial Gases business unit.\nLike Massy industries, it serves the business community. Massy Trading and Distribution operates under the Integrated Retail (IR) business unit. Despite being under the IR business unit, the annual report lists it as a company that focuses on serving other businesses. In fact, it is the automotive component of the Automotive and Industrial Engineering business unit that serves the consumer market. The services that are provided through MoneyGram and Sure Pay of the Massy’s Finance unit are also directed at the consumer market.\nAs could be expected, a company with that many parts and locations controls a lot of assets. The Massy Group by Guyana’s standards is a large company. According to the 2015 Annual Report of the Group, it had approximately G$323 billion in assets under its control which helped it to generate an estimated G$385 billion in revenues. The Massy operations in Guyana remain a vital part of the",
        "baseline": " Group’s success. The company admitted in its 2014 Annual Report that the good fortunes that the gold and rice industries enjoyed contributed immensely to the economic success reported by the company in that performance year. Emboldened by the business prospects in Guyana, the Massy Group in Guyana opened a 75,000 square foot warehouse facility with modern inventory and warehousing amenities. However, things were not as bright in 2015 on account of the lower price of gold during that year.\nBut Massy’s operations in Guyana are not without problems. Two things are of great concern to the organization. One is safety and the other is customer service. Any Guyanese could understand why the company would be concerned about safety, particularly as it relates to road safety. The company in Guyana had many near misses and two fatal accidents in less than two months in 2014. While the company reports improvements in its health and safety posture, vehicular accidents in Guyana continue to be a problem.",

In between, Lilly retired 17 straight by using a sneaky fastball that looked better because of Lilly’s ability to throw curveballs and changeups for strikes when he wasn’t bouncing pitches in the dirt or throwing behind batters.\nBut it was a fastball that Relaford spanked to right that scored pinch-runner Luis Ugueto from second, broke Lilly’s heart and lowered his record to 0-2 as Andy Pettitte’s replacement.\nEven when Relaford’s hit fell in, Lilly hoped right fielder Gerald Williams would keep Ugueto at third. Ugueto, who was running for Dan Wilson, who walked, was running on the pitch. He slid into third and had to scramble to get up and score.\n“I knew the guy took off but I still thought we had a chance to throw him out at the plate, or have first and third and I would have a chance to get out of it,” Lilly said.\n“He was already gone,” Gerald Williams said when asked about throwing home.\nIt was the first time since Bill Bevens in 1947 that a Yankee pitcher lost a one-hitter.

This is only a 67MHz increase on the previous fastest Athlon XP, the 2000+, which runs at 1.67GHz.

Storage is provided by an 80GB 7,200rpm Maxtor Ultra-ATA/133 hard disk, and there are two optical drives -- a 16X Pioneer DVD-ROM and a 24X write, 10X rewrite, 40X read TEAC CD-RW. There's also a standard floppy drive in the single external 3.5in. bay, and one external 5.25in. bay remains free for further expansion. Inside, the drive cage has room for another 3.5in. device. Two of the motherboard's five PCI slots are occupied, by a Sound Blaster Audigy that also provides an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) port, and a 56Kbit/s modem. The AGP slot is occupied by an ATI Radeon 8500LE graphics card fitted with 64MB of DDR SDRAM.\nAll the standard I/O ports are present and correct on the back panel -- serial (2), parallel, PS/2 (2) along with a good complement of USB connectors. Two USB 1.1 ports and two fast USB 2.0 ports are provided as standard, and Mesh has connected two further ports to the USB 1.1 header on the motherboard (which also supports a further two USB 2.0 ports in a similar fashion if necessary).\nThe monitor supplied with the Matrix XP 2100+PPC is NEC's 17in. flat-panel MultiSync LCD1700V, which saves desk space compared to an equivalent CRT monitor and delivers a bright, clear 1,280 by 1,024 pixel image. An LCD monitor is great for everyday applications, but gamers or users of graphically demanding software may prefer a CRT monitor, which can deliver a superior refresh rate and better colour fidelity.\nWhen it comes to overall performance, the Athlon XP 2100+-based",

However, it's worth noting that Dell's Pentium 4 system had 256MB of RAM compared to the Mesh's 512MB. Graphics performance is excellent, the 64MB Radeon 8500LE delivering the fastest 3DMark 2001 score we've seen so far -- although we've yet to test a desktop PC with a graphics card that uses the new nVidia GeForce4 chip.\nWith Windows XP Home Edition pre-installed and Lotus SmartSuite 9.7 bundled, the Mesh Matrix XP 2100+PPC delivers top-notch performance and is good value at £1,399 (ex. VAT). It's not especially pretty to look at, but there's room for expansion, and the supplied components certainly deliver the goods.",

Groupe Sélection director of architecture Mathieu Millette was on hand to field questions.\nThe fact that the project would be located on a 20-100-year flood zone and snuggled up to a 0-20-year flood zone raised eyebrows. Water-adjacent properties in Pierrefonds-Roxoboro were ravaged during historic flooding in 2017. The flooding devastated a number of Quebec municipalities, prompting the government to request an updated map of the province’s flood zones. However, the new map has yet to materialize, so the location of the retirement facility is based on dated information.\nMillette told the gathering that design measures were in place to manage any future flooding. The first floor of apartments would be much higher than in a standard condo tower, the underground parking structure would be impermeable — “sealed like a ship” — the entrance to the parking lot would have a raised lip to prevent water flowing in and a pump would be installed in the underground parking lot to handle any water mishaps.\nAnd there were questions about why the entrance to the parking lot was on the residential Rive-Boisée street and not Gouin Blvd. — a main thoroughfare. Millette said the configuration of the property, which includes land designated a 0-20-year flood zone which cannot be developed in any way, meant there was only one possible location for the underground parking entrance that would allow for fluid underground vehicle circulation. He said that Groupe Sélection statistics show that retired tenants don’t all have cars and if they do, they use them less.

        "prompt": "The Alaska fishery could be America’s last great resource giveaway–and powerful companies are fighting for a piece of it.\nDon Tyson has never fished aboard a Bering Sea trawler, risking his life against treacherous weather to bring home a catch of cod or pollock. He hasn’t worked a midnight deck shift in 30-foot seas or used a baseball bat to pound at the ice that builds up on riggings and rails.\nTyson lives in the hill country of northwest Arkansas, more than 3,000 miles from Alaska. “I’m just a chicken farmer,” he likes to say. But this chicken farmer has turned a modest family business into one of the nation’s largest food conglomerates, grossing more than $4 billion a year.\nTyson Foods now wants to claim one of the biggest shares of the Alaska fishery. The harvest rights it seeks from the federal government would be worth tens of millions of dollars each year. And unless federal law is amended, the government may hand over the fishery without Tyson–or anyone else–paying a dime in royalties.\nTyson has developed strong ties with President Bill Clinton, and those ties could help the company as it makes its case. The Alaska governor’s office says Tyson representatives “definitely” led them to believe they have influence in Washington.\nThe privatization of the Alaska fishery could be the country’s last great resource handout. The prairies were homesteaded in the past century; the railroads have claimed their vast land grants; many of the rich mining deposits on public lands have long since been staked out. The Alaska fishery is one of the richest in the world, with a treasure trove of pollock, cod, crab, and other species. It’s a resource many Americans don’t even know they own.\nTyson ventured into the fishing industry in June 1992, just about the time that Bill Clinton consolidated his hold on the Democratic presidential nomination. The corporation sought a seafood entree for its corporate dinner plate, and so spent $212 million to buy Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp., the largest fishing company in the country.\nSome industry observers questioned Tyson’s purchase because Seattle-based Arctic Alaska had an aging fleet and a formidable array of legal problems. The worst of these problems were detailed last April, when a federal grand jury hit Arctic Alaska with a 44-count indictment. It charged the company with sending unsafe ships to sea, falsifying documents, and lying about crew qualifications, among other crimes. The grand jury said these acts were part of a conspiracy that had put profits ahead of people and led to the 1990 sinking of an Arctic Alaska fishing vessel, an accident that killed nine people.\nBut Arctic Alaska’s single-minded pursuit of fish helped it to become one of the biggest seafood harvesters in the Bering Sea. And the quantity of fish Arctic Alaska caught, irrespective of how many laws it may have broken to catch them, has put the company–and its new owner Tyson–in a position to win a big share of the fishery.\nTyson Foods is wealthy and well-connected, but it isn’t the only major player in the high-stakes fish lotto. Another is Christiania Bank of Norway, which bankrolled a big chunk of the Bering Sea fleet with more than $300 million in loans. Most of those loans are now in default, and the bank hopes to take the fishing shares of the boats that can’t pay up. Other players include largely Japanese-owned shore processors; the catcher-boat fleet and hook-and-line fishermen who deliver to the processors; and native Eskimo and Aleut fishermen.\nThey all recognize that big changes are coming to the Bering Sea fishery. Too many fishermen, wielding awesome fishing technology, are going after too few fish. When the fleet shrinks there will be winners and losers. All the players are trying to make sure that whatever reform takes place will put them in the winners’ circle.\nAlaska’s trawlers threw away 763 million pounds of fish last year. Under the reform backed by Tyson, some of the most wasteful companies would get the biggest shares of the fishery.\nSo far, the federal government has tried to manage the catch by limiting the seasons for different species of fish. Seasons that once stretched out for most of the year have shrunk to a few months. This turns the harvests into frantic derbies in which boats grab as much as they can as fast as they can. The result is incredible waste, unsafe fishing practices, and economic chaos for the industry.\nScientists are also increasingly concerned about the effects of this intensive fishing on the broader Bering Sea ecosystem. The Steller sea lion, for instance, is now listed as a threatened species. Scientists have also tracked sharp population declines in fur seals and some sea birds. And while the stocks of pollock still appear relatively healthy, their total biomass has declined.\nMeanwhile, the fishermen slug it out in ever-shorter seasons. Under the derby system, they lack the time and financial incentives to try to avoid catching fish that aren’t worth processing or are not legally in season. Last year, the Alaska fleet caught 4.2 billion pounds of fish, then dumped a staggering 763 million pounds–seven times more fish than is retained by the entire New England fleet. As the competition intensifies, so do the pressures to keep fishing through the worst winter storms, increasing the risks in an occupation that has already killed more than 165 fishermen off Alaska in the past six years.\nTo top it all off, the harvests, despite their gargantuan scale, are too small to sustain the overcapitalized fleet. Some vessel owners have already filed for bankruptcy, and more filings are expected later this year.\nAs a solution to these problems, Tyson and some other players are politicking for a kind of 20th-century homestead act. The plan would divide the annual harvest into shares, which would be given to fishing companies in proportion to some part of their historic catch. The more fish and crab an operator caught in the past, the bigger its share. Companies could then leisurely fish their shares (called “individual transferable quotas,” or ITQs), lease them to other operators, or sell them to the highest bidder. The total market value of all the shares could easily exceed $1 billion according to several industry officials.\nBy ending the race for fish, factory trawler operators say they could curtail the waste. Boats would target the species they want and would take the time to process whatever fish they caught. Skippers would avoid practices that endangered the lives of their crew members. And the fleet would shrink as marginal operators sold out their shares. “We are convinced that the future of the fishery up there is dependent on getting toward some sort of ITQ system,” said Archie Schaffer, an Arkansas-based spokesperson for Tyson.\nBut not everyone agrees that privately held quotas are the best way to reform the harvest. Even if the government does turn to private quotas, critics say, the public should scrutinize the deals and gain fair payment. They fear quotas would prevent future generations of small boat fishermen from breaking into the harvest. And they question a system that would reward those companies with the biggest historic catches, since those companies may have been the ones that flooded the harvest grounds with too many boats, or broke safety and environmental regulations, or wasted the most fish.\nThe hub of the Bering Sea fishery is the remote island community of Unalaska, located some 800 miles southwest of Anchorage on the Aleutian chain. Unalaska moves to the rhythms of the fisheries, with great spasms of activity each winter as the factory trawler and crab fleets move north from Seattle to prepare for season openings. Hundreds of boisterous–sometimes brawling–fishermen and processing crews descend on the island bars as the vessels take on fuel, food, and other supplies. Then they take to the sea to work in mind-numbing shifts of six hours on, six hours off, for what may be weeks on end.\nMore than half of the Alaska bottom fish is taken by an at-sea factory fleet that harvests with trawl nets and lines dangling thousands of baited hooks. Tyson has a considerable stake in this fleet, but many of the biggest vessels are financed by Christiania and other foreign banks, and some are actually owned by foreign investors.\nIn addition to the factory ships, there are boats that deliver fish to shore plants for processing. One of the smallest of these is the 85-foot Lone Star, skippered by Chuck Burrece.\nIn the early days of the fishery, Burrece could find plenty of cod without venturing far from port. But this year, the season was short and the old fishing spot near town was closed to protect Steller sea lions. To find cod, Burrece had to push the Lone Star to its limits, journeying 60 to 70 miles out to the dangerous strait known as Unimak Pass.\nHe worked the fishing ground for three days with a trawl net that scooped up about 200,000 pounds of edible fish. But Burrece and his two crewmen dumped some 70,000 pounds of dead and dying pollock, sole, and halibut. They got rid of the halibut because federal regulations retain them for the hook-and-line fleet. The rest went over because the plant Burrece delivers to was only prepared to handle cod.\nThe shore processors (most of which are owned by Japanese conglomerates) are another group concerned with how the fishery is reformed. They have managed to win special federal protection that guarantees them 35 percent of the pollock harvest through 1995. After that date, they fear they will lose out altogether in a reform program that simply doles out catching rights. They have argued for a second tier of “processing rights” that would mandate that they handle a portion of the catch. “If there’s some benefit that’s going to be handed out, we want to belly up to the bar like everyone else,” says Dennis Phelan, a vice president of the Pacific Seafood Processors Association.\nTyson’s outpost in Unalaska is in a small two-story office building squeezed between the mountains and a long dock frequented by its fleet. A sign posted on the wall warns crew members that “fighting, public intoxication, and reporting to the vessels under the influence of alcohol” are cause for firing. Don Tyson’s son, John, who helped to arrange the Arctic Alaska buyout, has tried several times to visit the company’s Unalaska outpost, but each time his aircraft was unable to land due to foul weather. The senior Tyson has yet to make the journey.\nFrom a single chicken processing plant in the 1950s, Tyson has grown into the world’s largest poultry producer. During the past 25 years, the company, through more than 20 acquisitions, sought to dominate a major share of the American food industry by expanding its “center-of-the-plate” protein offerings to include pork, beef, and now fish.\nSo far that strategy has paid off for both Tyson and its investors. The company’s stock ranked third in total returns during the 20-year period that ended in 1992, according to one financial analysis. Last year, Tyson reported sales of $4.7 billion.\nTyson has also cultivated political ties, most notably with Bill Clinton after he was elected Arkansas’ governor. Tyson offered Clinton rides in the company’s corporate jet and became an important fund-raiser during his presidential bid. Tyson Food executives and their families gave $20,750 to Clinton’s campaign and another $22,000 to Democratic Party organizations. The company’s chief legal counsel, James Blair, is a close personal friend of the Clintons and advised Hillary on her well-publicized cattle futures trading.\nThe week before Tyson announced its 1992 purchase of Arctic Alaska, word of the buyout apparently leaked, triggering a surge of Arkansas investment in the fishing company. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating a group of Arkansas investors, including a firm then headed by White House Administration Director Patsy Thomasson, for possible insider trading. For those investors, short-term profits were spectacular. When Tyson announced the buyout price, Arctic Alaska’s stock shot up 69 percent.\nBut Tyson’s stock dipped at the news, foreshadowing later trouble. Tyson took over a company that would ultimately be saddled with a criminal indictment.\nArctic Alaska was founded in 1983 by fisherman Francis Miller. At the time of Tyson’s buyout, the company owned more than 30 trawlers, hook-and-line boats, and crab vessels.\nMany of the vessels had been converted from other uses and shipped north without meeting stability standards required by the Coast Guard. One of those vessels, the Aleutian Enterprise, sank in a 1990 accident that claimed nine lives and triggered April’s grand jury indictment against the company, Miller, and other Arctic officials of that era.\nThe indictment painted a chilling picture of unqualified officers leading green–sometimes teenage–crews out to sea in unsafe ships. Officers must submit sea time to gain certification, and an affidavit unsealed after the indictment charged that Arctic Alaska officials had falsified that sea time.\nIn addition, Tyson has found that Miller was lax in pollution controls. Last year, Arctic Alaska was hit with a $750,000 fine by the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to grind and properly dispose of fish wastes under the Miller regime. The company also faces a criminal lawsuit filed by the state of Alaska charging that the fleet repeatedly fished with illegal bottom gear in sensitive coastal waters. Tyson has hired Alaska Gov. Walter Hickel’s personal attorney, Hal Horton, to help settle the still-pending charges against Arctic Alaska. According to state officials, Tyson also flew legal counsel and Clinton friend James Blair up from Little Rock to plead Arctic Alaska’s case.\nSome fishing industry insiders wondered why Tyson would invest in a North Pacific company when it was apparent that too many boats were already chasing the fish. In an interview a few months after the acquisition, John Tyson told a trade journal that the company took its cue, in part, from industry proposals to create the share system. Tyson hopes that Arctic Alaska’s long catch history will ensure a large slice of the fish pie. As it lobbies for the new system, Tyson is positioning itself as an “all-American” company that has a more legitimate claim to the resource than the foreign investors and banks that stand behind many other fishery players.\nWhen the world fished only with small nets, hooks, and lines, instead of trawls the size of small shopping malls, the ocean could make fish as fast as we killed and ate them. From 1988 to 1990, Americans ate a record 47 pounds of seafood each, much of it imported; the Japanese, 160 pounds; and Icelanders, 203 pounds. The Maldivians on the Indian Ocean were the champions at 293 pounds.\nFor decades foreign fleets controlled many of the trawler harvests in U.S. coastal waters. The 1976 Magnuson Act, which put a 200-mile zone under U.S. control, was in large part an attempt to claim the harvest for Americans. That vision was reaffirmed in 1987 by legislation that banned most foreign vessels from reflagging as U.S. ships, and also restricted foreign ownership of U.S. fishing vessels.\nBut some in Congress had doubts about squeezing off foreign investment that might help finance the American fleet, and the legislation had plenty of loopholes. During the next five years, some boats came under the direct control of foreign investors, while others were beholden to foreign banks.\nThe single biggest financier was Christiania Bank of Norway, which loaned at least $315 million to factory trawlers and other vessels. These vessels stampeded into the Bering Sea in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Now, with the short seasons and low prices, many ship operators can’t make their payments. Christiania has foreclosed on at least four factory trawlers.\nAlong with the vessels, Christiania hopes to gain control of any fishing rights awarded to these companies. According to a Christiania loan document, the bank has asked its borrowers to sign covenants that pledge these rights as collateral. That means if the bank calls a loan, it will end up with both the vessel and a piece of the U.S. fishery.\nThe politics of fish in America have clearly promoted development over sustainability. Modern industrial fishing is run by insiders, many of whose fortunes depend on the decisions they make. Foxes and henhouses come to mind.\nThe power to determine the fate of the Alaska fishery rests with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, an 11-member group dominated by fishing industry representatives. They pass their plans on to the National Marine Fisheries Service, an agency in the Commerce Department, for final approval.\nMost of the council members are from Alaska, and they have frequently aligned themselves with the shore plant operators out of concern that a share plan would give most of the harvest to out-of-state factory trawlers.\nNonetheless, the council has already approved a share plan for the $100 million-a-year hook-and-line harvest of halibut and black cod, and is now considering a share plan for the rest of the harvest. The hook-and-line plan set aside a small percentage of the catch for regional natives, and the new plan might do the same.\nThe council has been slow in developing the new share plan. In April, it voted to consider a two-step process that would first limit the size of the fleet, then eventually award rights. In a nod to conservation concerns, the plan also called for incentives that would give extra quotas to fishermen who reduced waste.\nTyson and other factory trawler owners have been lobbying to get the program on a faster track. For Tyson, that’s also meant trying to improve the company’s image in Alaska. Last March, Don Tyson flew to Alaska to meet with Gov. Hickel and other state officials. Tyson talked of investing in shore plants and using the corporation’s power to push more fish into the American diet.\nAlaska state officials claim that one Tyson representative said the company could talk to the White House about lifting a ban on the foreign export of Alaska oil, a congressional embargo that costs the state hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. “They definitely left us with the impression that they had influence with the Clinton administration,” says John Manly, Gov. Hickel’s spokesperson. What Tyson wanted was fishery council members who would support a quota system.\nThus far, Tyson’s success in shaping the council has been limited. For each vacant seat, the governor proposes three candidates, one of whom is selected to fill the post by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. One of the nominees Tyson favored was pressured to withdraw by Alaska officials who feared a council tilt toward the Arkansas company. Another Tyson-backed candidate, Clem Tillion, is a controversial figure in Alaska, and the state Senate has asked Brown to pick someone else.\nIf the council fails to deliver on the quota plan, Tyson or other factory trawler operators could go over their heads by lobbying the Clinton administration and Congress. Some factory trawler representatives have already proposed an amendment to the Magnuson Act–now up for reauthorization–that would give the Commerce Department power to develop a plan on its own.\nBut Rollie Schmitten, the director of the National Marine Fisheries Service, says the regional council should decide whether to introduce share plans. Schmitten also proposes a new fishing industry fee to finance $82 million of his agency’s $280 million annual budget, a cost currently picked up by taxpayers. And he thinks those fortunate enough to claim harvest shares bear a special burden to pay. “If you are going to bestow a public resource to certain individuals, then there ought to be some sort of equity to the public,” Schmitten says.\nThe Magnuson Act generally prohibits the government from levying fees on the use of national fisheries, but many members of Congress are joining Schmitten in pushing for amendments to the act that would allow for fees to help pay the cost of managing the resource and enforcing regulations.\nThe battle over the future of this fishery is likely to play out over the next few years both in Washington, D.C., and at Alaska council meetings. And while fishermen fight over who gets to profit from the resource, it will be up to the council and fishery managers to keep the fishery healthy.\nMany fishermen are convinced that Alaska fisheries will remain strong, avoiding the fate of New England, Newfoundland, and other great fisheries that have been fished out. But conservationists fear these harvests could be the last buffalo hunts of a dwindling resource.\nEveryone from Tyson officials to small boat fishermen like Chuck Burrece now speaks the gospel of conservation. But there",

        "prompt": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Surging shale production is poised to push U.S. oil output to more than 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970 and crossing a threshold few could have imagined even a decade ago.\nAnd this new record, expected within days, likely won’t last long. The U.S. government forecasts that the nation’s production will climb to 11 million barrels a day by late 2019, a level that would rival Russia, the world’s top producer.\nThe economic and political impacts of soaring U.S. output are breathtaking, cutting the nation’s oil imports by a fifth over a decade, providing high-paying jobs in rural communities and lowering consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent from a 2008 peak.\n“It has had incredibly positive impacts for the U.S. economy, for the workforce and even our reduced carbon footprint” as shale natural gas has displaced coal at power plants, said John England, head of consultancy Deloitte’s U.S. energy and resources practice.\nU.S. energy exports now compete with Middle East oil for buyers in Asia. Daily trading volumes of U.S. oil futures contracts have more doubled in the past decade, averaging more than 1.2 billion barrels per day in 2017, according to exchange operator CME Group.\nThe U.S. oil price benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, is now watched closely worldwide by foreign customers of U.S. gasoline, diesel and crude.\nThe question of whether the shale sector can continue at this pace remains an open debate. The rapid growth has stirred concerns that the industry is already peaking and that production forecasts are too optimistic.\nThe costs of labor and contracted services have recently risen sharply in the most active oilfields; drillable land prices have soared; and some shale financiers are calling on producers to focus on improving short-term returns rather than expanding drilling.\nBut U.S. producers have already far outpaced expectations and overcome serious challenges, including the recent effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to sink shale firms by flooding global markets with oil.\nThe cartel of oil-producing nations backed down in November 2016 and enacted production cuts amid pressure from their own members over low prices - which had plunged to below $27 earlier that year from more than $100 a barrel in 2014.\nShale producers won the price war through aggressive cost-cutting and rapid advances in drilling technology. Oil now trades above $64 a barrel, enough for many U.S. producers to finance both expanded drilling and dividends for shareholders.\nEfficiencies spurred by the battle with OPEC - including faster drilling, better well designs and more fracking - helped U.S. firms produce enough oil to successfully lobby for the repeal of a ban on oil exports. In late 2015, Congress overturned the prohibition it had imposed following OPEC’s 1973 embargo.\nThe United States now exports up to 1.7 million barrels per day of crude, and this year will have the capacity to export 3.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Terminals conceived for importing liquefied natural gas have now been overhauled to allow exports.\nThat export demand, along with surging production in remote locations such as West Texas and North Dakota, has led to a boom in U.S. pipeline construction. Firms including Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products Partners added 26,000 miles of liquids pipelines in the five years between 2012 and 2016, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Several more multi-billion-dollar pipeline projects are on the drawing board.\nU.S. drillers say they can supply plenty more.\n“We continue to see and drive improvements” in drilling speed and efficiency, said Mathias Schlecht, a technology vice president at Baker Hughes, General Electric Co’s oilfield services business.\nNew wells can be drilled in as little as a week, he said. A few years ago, it could take up to a month.\nThe next phase of shale output growth depends on techniques to squeeze more oil from each well. Companies are now putting sensors on drill bits to more precisely access oil deposits, using artificial intelligence and remote operators to get the most out of equipment and trained engineers.\nAs expanded investments push more producers to add wells in less productive regions, technology will help make those plays more profitable, said Kate Richard, chief executive of Warwick Energy Group, which owns interests in more than 5,000 U.S. wells.\nIn an interview, she estimated about a third of the money from private equity investments in shale will be used to wring more oil from overlooked regions.\nHigher prices - up about $10 a barrel in the last two months - also may encourage the industry to work through a backlog of some 7,300 drilled-but-uncompleted shale wells that have built up because of crew and equipment shortages.\nThe higher prices have suppliers that provide hydraulic fracturing services, such as Keane Group and Liberty Oilfield Services, buying expensive new equipment in anticipation of more work.\nU.S. fracking service revenues are expected to grow by 20 percent this year, approaching a record of $29 billion set in 2014, according to oilfield research firm Spears & Associates.\nThe shale revolution initially upended the traditional industry hierarchy, making billionaires out of wildcatters such as Harold Hamm, who founded Continental Resources, and the late Aubrey McClendon of Chesapeake Energy.\nTop U.S. oil firms such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron a decade ago turned much of",

Chevron this year plans to spend $4.3 billion on shale development.\nThe majors’ shift is driving up costs for labor and drillable land in the region, another boost to wages and wealth in rural areas.\nIn the shale industry hub of Midland, Texas, unemployment has fallen to a mere 2.6 percent, said Willie Taylor, executive director of the Permian Basin Workforce Development Board, a group that helps firms find staff.\nCompanies are now offering signing bonuses to attract workers to West Texas.

        "prompt": "Demand better regulations from your legislators (and buy a filter in the meantime).\nIn April 2015, Deborah Graham, a resident of the tiny town of Salisbury, North Carolina, received a letter from the North Carolina Division of Public Health, who wanted to let her know that the water coming out of her tap–the same water she used to fill her kids’ water bottles and cook dinner–was chock-full of vanadium, a coal-ash-derived chemical that causes nausea and, later in life, neurological decline. The public health authority also sent notices to 424 other households in the state.\nDuke Energy, which supplies electricity for the state, had been depositing the ash created by burning coal into 32 pits throughout the state for decades. Coal ash contains radioactive materials and heavy metals; when it’s deposited into the pits, which are often unlined ponds, contaminants seep into the groundwater, through the local water system pipes, and from there make their way into people’s taps, water glasses, and bodies.\nIn the film From the Ashes, a Bloomberg Philanthropies-produced documentary that premiered last month, we see Graham hauling 24-packs of bottled water into her home to drink and cook with, while waging an advocacy battle against Duke Energy, demanding that the utility shell out the tens of millions it will take to clean up the water supply.\nGraham’s situation is far from unique. The Environmental Working Group’s updated Tap Water Database aggregated data from 2010 to 2015 from 50,000 utilities across all 50 states, and found traces of over 250 contaminants. Over 160 of those contaminants are unregulated, which means that despite their known adverse health effects, there’s no law limiting their presence in water supplies.\nAnyone can access the database, enter their zip code, and see a list of utilities that serve their area, as well as the contaminants found in their water. While the Environmental Protection Agency sets legal limits, measured in parts per billion (ppb) on a handful of chemicals, like chloroform and trichloroacetic acid (both known carcinogens); under those regulations, water utilities must comply with a certain level of contamination or face a fine. But legal limits, Leiba says, are not necessarily health-protective limits. “They’re a compromise between health, cost, and feasibility,” she says. What the EWG has done with this update of the Tap Water Database is to develop and establish what they’re calling “EWG standards,” which reflect truly health-protective limits. “So for nitrates, we’re not looking at 10 ppb, which is the legal limit; we’re looking at how many people are affected by levels over 5 ppb, which could be cancerous,” Leiba says.\nNitrates are among the most common contaminants in the EWG database; the researchers detected high levels of the chemical",

Other common culprits, also found in all 50 states, include chromium-6, a pervasive carcinogen that leaks into water from industrial waste sites, and lead, the excessive presence of which in Flint, Michigan’s water ignited a national outcry.\nBut the database, for the most part, steers clear of sweeping generalizations about trends in the national water supply, but Leiba notes that contamination levels tend to rise as incomes lower. In the 79406 zip code of Lubbock, Texas, where the per-capita household income is $2,905, EWG found 12 contaminants above the health limit; in Manalapan, Florida (not coincidentally, not far from Mar-A-Lago), the per-capital income is $143,729, and just two contaminants were detected.",

        "prompt": "It's only the Super Bowl of the running world, NBD.\nThe Boston Marathon is the oldest marathon in the United States. It's also one of the World Marathon Majors, a series of six of the largest and most renowned marathons in the world. That should be enough to land it on any runner's bucket list. The fact that Marathon Monday is one of the biggest, rowdiest block parties in the running world, whether you're racing or not? Well, that's just an added bonus.\nWhen Is the Boston Marathon?\nThe Boston Marathon has always been held on Patriot's Day, a holiday commemorating the start of the Revolutionary War (it's only recognized in Massachusetts and Maine, which is why you've probably never heard of it and definitely don't have the day off work if you don't live in those states).\nWhen the race was first founded, Patriot's Day was always celebrated on April 19, so that's when the race was held (unless the 19th fell on a Sunday; then, the race was held Monday the 20th). But in 1969, the holiday—and the race—was officially moved to the third Monday in April. Hence, every Bostonian's favorite holiday: #MarathonMonday.\nIn 2019, the race will take place on April 15.\nHow Many People Run the Boston Marathon?\nIn 1897, there were just 15 runners; by the Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996, the race established a record as the world's largest marathon with 35,868 finishers.\nBut in 2015, the B.A.A. set the field size at 30,000 official entrants and has maintained that cap since. So while it's one of the most prestigious marathons, it isn't the largest. (For comparison's sake, the New York City Marathon set a new world record with 52,812 finishers in 2018).\nBesides the runners, though, around 500,000 spectators line the streets of Boston and its suburbs (especially near colleges like Wellesley, Boston College, and Boston University) each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Sorry, Tom Brady.\nFYI, spectators: The Boston Marathon even has its own beer. 26.2 Brew—a golden, hazy ale brewed with Himalayan sea salt and coriander—was created by Advanced Cicerone Shelley Smith with running champs Meb Keflezighi and Desiree Linden (who will defend her Boston Marathon title on April 15). The beer, which has been available for the past seven years during the Boston Marathon, is now on sale nationwide.\nThe majority of people who run the marathon have qualified to be there. Qualifying standards were introduced in 1970, with the official B.A.A. entry form stating, \"A runner must submit the certification...that he has trained sufficiently to finish the course in less than four hours.\"\nPeople have been getting significantly faster in recent years, though, and more people have qualified than there are spots available. While there are 30,000 bibs up for grabs, just 80 percent of those are for qualifiers; the other 20 percent are reserved for charity entrants (more on that in a sec).\nDue to the increased number of qualifiers in the past few years, the B.A.A. recently announced qualifying standards will be five minutes faster for all age groups, starting with the 2020 Boston Marathon.\nBut a BQ time still doesn't guarantee entry—you actually have to run faster than the specified qualifying time for your age group and gender given the fact that so many other people are out there qualifying.\nYou can typically register in mid-September for the following April's marathon, but you'll have to have run your BQ time before then. (To register for the 2020 race, for example, you would have had to run your qualifying race before September 15, 2018.) Registration is on a rolling schedule; people who qualified by 20 minutes or more go first, then people who qualified by 10 minutes or more, and so on—as long as there's space left.\nWhat If I Can't Qualify for the Boston Marathon?\nYou can still run it! The B.A.A. saves 20 percent of race bibs for charities, sponsors, vendors, municipal officials, local running clubs, and so on. But the easiest way to get in is through one of the organization's charity partners, like Back On My Feet, 261 Fearless, or the American Red Cross.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Course Like?\nThe Boston Marathon course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston—so, technically, you aren't actually running in Boston proper until around mile 24. The point to point route passes through eight cities and towns, including Hopkinton, Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston.\nThe best runners in the world race the Boston Marathon course, but it's actually not officially a world record-qualifying course. The International Association of Athletic Federations sets standards for these kind of races, and the Boston Marathon misses the mark for a couple reasons: 1) It's a race from point A to point B, which could give runners a wind advantage, since they're only running in one direction, and 2) its elevation changes are too steep.\nIt's those elevation changes that make the Boston Marathon one of the most difficult of the World Marathon Majors. The first half of the course is mostly downhill (any BM veteran will warn you not to go out too fast), and runners actually drop 459 feet over the whole course.\nBut the second half is where the course will crush you: The four \"Newton hills\" start at the 16-mile mark, and those back-to-back climbs can feel brutal on tired legs. Not to mention, those hills culminate in the infamous Heartbreak Hill, a 0.4-mile climb between the 20- and 21-mile marks. It's only an 88-foot vertical change, but it comes right as many marathoners hit the dreaded \"wall.\"\nThe last five miles are mostly downhill again, and Boston proper is home to the most famous turn in running—a right on Hereford out of Kenmore Square followed by a quick left on Boylston Street to run the final four blocks to the finish line at Copley Plaza, right next to the Boston Public Library.\nThe Boston Marathon has actually had four finish lines over the years: the Irvington Oval, a track in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood; Exeter Street between Boylston and St. James Streets; Ring Road, a service road parallel to Boylston Street in front of the Prudential Center; and its current location on Boylston between Exeter and Dartmouth streets. Today's finish line—at Copley Plaza, right next to the Boston Public Library—was chosen in 1985, when John Hancock Financial Services started sponsoring the race.\nBesides the moving finish line, the rest of the course has pretty much stayed exactly the same for nearly 100 years",
        "baseline": ". In 1897, though, the course was actually only 24.5 miles long—from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the Irvington Oval in Boston. That was based on the 1896 Olympic marathon distance of 24.8 miles; it wasn't until 1924 that the distance was standardized for all future Olympic marathons at 42 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) and the start line moved back to Hopkinton.\nHow Can I Watch the Boston Marathon?\nEven if you're not in Boston, you can still catch all the action. NBCSN and NBCSN Gold will start airing race day coverage on Monday at 8:30 a.m. through 1 p.m. ET.\nSpectators watching live or on TV can track runners through the B.A.A.'s mobile app, which is free for iPhone users in the Apple app store and for Android users in Google Play. The app sends out push notifications with updates for your runners every 5K.",
        "llm_baseline": ". The only major change was in 2013, when the race was moved from its traditional Patriots' Day date to April 15 due to the Boston Marathon bombing.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Weather Like?\nThe Boston Marathon is notorious for its unpredictable weather. It's been held in everything from a snowstorm to a heat wave, and the temperature has ranged from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 89 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature is 45 degrees Fahrenheit, but it's been as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit and as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe weather is also a big reason why the Boston Marathon is so difficult. The course is mostly downhill, so it's easy to go out too fast and get caught in the cold or heat. And the hills in the second half of the race can be brutal if you're not prepared for them.\nThe Boston Marathon is also notorious for its wind.

But it's also not a race you can just show up to and run without training. It's a big deal, and it's not for the faint of heart.\nBut if you're looking for a marathon that's as much about the experience as the race, this one's for you.

He was inspired by the Olympic marathon at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and wanted to bring the race to the United States.\nThe first Boston Marathon was held on April 19, 1897, and was originally called the American Marathon. Participants had to pay a $1 entry fee, and the race was open to anyone who wanted to run it. Runners had to be at least 18 years old and had to be able to run the entire distance without stopping.\nThe first Boston Marathon was won by John J. Pell, who finished in 2:55:10.

That's a little later than the 2018 start time of 8:40 a.m., which was the earliest start time in race history.\nThe first wave of runners will start at 8:40 a.m., with a one-minute gap between waves.

        "prompt": "Katie shot this photo of Tim (that's me) on the summit of Tunnel Mountain. By the way, there's no tunnel on Tunnel Mountain. Long story.\nWe headed to Banff National Park from our lodge (not ours, just visiting) in Canmore. According to something Katie read, Banff is the No. 1 vacation destination in Canada, and it’s easy to see why. It seems like everywhere you look, there’s a stunning mountain range or a stunning waterfall or a stunning lake or a stunning castle-like hotel, or a stunning combination of the above. And in the middle is the town of Banff, a larger, even livelier version of Canmore. We walked around town — had lunch at a downstairs cafe in which the sandwiches cost around $13 (it’s amazing how expensive everything is, including the gas) and later sampled beers at a cool pub, the Grizzly Paw — but spent even more time driving around with Katie seeking out the natural attractions. And, I must admit, every one was pretty astonishing.\nWe stopped at one waterfall and looked up and saw nestled upon a hill the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, which was built in the 1880s and looks like something out of a glamorous 1940s movie (“Why, look, there’s Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh! And isn’t the Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine strolling behind them?”) We hiked (that word!) up the hill, got in through a back door and checked out the establishment. It was fairly empty (I imagine the guests were out doing things), which made giant common areas seem that much larger. If the Downton Abbey folks were visiting Banff, this is where they’d stay.\nAfter a brief inspection, Katie and I went back outdoors on the hotel grounds and sat in Adirondack chairs facing — What else? — a beautiful view below us. Some of my favorite moments on this trip have been when Katie and I have just sat somewhere outside, relaxed and talked. This was one of those moments, as Katie explained to me the criteria for a listing in the U.S. National Register (which is related to her work). I shouldn’t be surprised by her accumulation of knowledge, given her education and experience, but it gives me such pleasure to listen to her speak with such (modest) authority on such things. She’s as obsessed with her vocation as I am with mine.\nWe had two similar experiences this day. One was when we sat on the curbing of a footpath overlooking a valley and we",

We didn’t talk much — I was too tired from the climb, though it wasn’t nearly as bad as my recent hike from hell. (Barely a wheeze came out of me, though I did have to stop to catch my breath now and then.) By the end, sitting on the summit, I actually felt pretty good.

        "prompt": "“ƒ”¹…”The more you bash Sri Lanka, the better off the Tamils are’. This is the guiding principle of the Tamil Diaspora, UNHRC headed by a Tamil, India controlled by Tamil political parties, manyfold Tamil NGOs abroad and in Sri Lanka, Tamil political parties in Sri Lanka and Tamil civil activists in Sri Lanka. The government of President Rajapaksa keeps appeasing Tamils. What it doesn’t realize is there will never be an end to Sri Lanka bashing if such bashing producers results for the bashers. A local saying goes, only a tree full of fruits get stoned, a barren tree will not be stoned. This is more applicable to Sri Lanka than any other country. It is high time the government understood this modus operandi and approach it accordingly.\nConventional war is about testing the military and political superiority of the parties. However, terrorism is completely different. In terrorism, the objective is to gain as much as possible from a government. There are two well co-ordinated claws in all terrorist operations. One is a hard one that carries out acts of terror forcing terrified governments and people to seek protection and peace. Then comes the soft arm of terrorism. It reassures the terrified people and the government and offers “ƒ”¹…”solution’. This “ƒ”¹…”solution’ is nothing but a highly disadvantageous position for the terrified people and the government. It is all about extortion. Once the extorted favour is obtained, the hard claw (terrorist group) scales down attacks temporarily. However, their attacks resume after a while. The cycle continues. Terrified people lose more and more while terrorist people gain more and more. It is this cycle that is known as terrorism.\nIn the Sri Lankan case the hard claw of terrorism comprised of the LTTE, EROS, TELO (military wing) and today it is made up of GTF, TFO, BTF, UNHRC and Tamil Nadu. The soft claw of terrorism is made up of TULF, Jehan Perera, CPA, TNA, UNHRC, India and western imperialists.\nDespite the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, terrorism continues through other Tamil actors.\nThe vicious cycle of threats, extortion, gratification and threats again needs to be broken to save the nation. It cannot be done by giving into Tamil demands hoping the demand will end. On the contrary, they increase with every successful demand. Instead a cap or a stop must be put to Tamil demands. Once the terror operators are convinced their demands fall on deaf ears, they are forced to give up gradually.\nTamils have a choice of extortion targets including Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Canada, Australia, etc. However, only Sri Lanka has been playing according to their expectations and as a result they have been concentrating only on Sri Lanka. When the government of Sri Lanka stops giving into Tamil demands, they will be forced to seek their demands elsewhere. Dravidistan demand was cut down by India in 1930s for the first time, 1947 for the second time and almost entirely in 1962 which pushed the Tamil national struggle to Sri Lanka. Tamils must be convinced Sri Lanka is not their paradise.\nTamils have cleverly exploited this temporary geopolitical goldmine in their favour.\nAt the moment geopolitics of the region is highly disadvantageous to Sri Lanka. The US-India axis is on a rampage intimidating all regional countries and China. There is a respite in terrorist threats on western interests which has given them more time to concentrate on human rights. However, it is fast changing. A definitive change is due after December 2014. NATO troops will substantially leave Afghanistan conceding defeat in December 2014 leaving a very weak Afghan security force to battle a rejuvenated Taliban. The terrorist group has already shifted gears anticipating the 2014 retreat. NATO troops have no future in Afghanistan as they are substantially leaving in another two years and the only challenge will be the Afghan army which is now taking a massive beating. Although NATO casualties have decreased after the announcement of the withdrawal plan, there is a corresponding and huge increase in Afghan troop casualties. How long can the weak Afghan troops last? Not very long as popular sentiment is rising against them from within. All the freedoms, democracy and security assurances “ƒ”¹…”won’ by NATO will be buried by January 2015.\nHowever, the withdrawal poses a massive security threat to western interests. Just because the NATO troops withdraw, the war will not stop. In fact the Taliban will be back in the west with a vengeance. NATO is now seeking help from India and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to intervene in the war torn country trying to contain the terrorists. India tries to pass the responsibility to SCO. It is unthinkably stupid for the SCO to assume this needless menace created by the west. Afghanistan or the Taliban is not the responsibility of the SCO. In fact, this potent terror group can be a strategic asset of the SCO against western hegemony. Hopeful of India’s positive response, USA props up India with every way it can. USA and its allies changed their decades old policy of not supplying nuclear materials to India. Western weapons are free flowing to India now. Kashmir and other horrendous Indian war crimes are forgotten by the west, for now.\nLate 2009 Robert Blake made a request to the Lankan Defence Secretary to send troops to Afghanistan as the war has ended which was put down citing unrest among local Muslims. It came with a warning “”…” unless Sri Lanka agrees, USA will bring war crimes allegations against the island nation. The US Possible War Crimes Report was released following the refusal to supply troops. Repeated requests were made with no positive outcome. Similar requests were made from India. Instead of an outright denial, India has been relaying mixed signals. Reluctantly it agreed to train the Afghan troops and police. However, India is pressurised to make a firm troop commitment in Afghanistan before the NATO troops leave in 2014. India now tries to convince SCO to “ƒ”¹…”play a bigger role’ in post-2014 Afghanistan. It is a ridiculous demand as India is only an observer state in the SCO, not a full member! Besides the SCO is not a military organisation.\nDuring the time of the last UNP government (2001-2004), Sri Lanka was among 54 countries that participated in a global network of involuntary disappearances, torture, murder and other human rights abuses led by the USA. Unarmed Muslim civilians were tortured and unlawful restrained under these activities in 2003. It created a rift between the then UNF government and its Muslim ally “”…” SLMC. In the same year Sri Lanka was instructed not to sign the Rome Statute Against Torture by the US network so that the country can remain a torture hub of the US network. For this reason, USA now wants a regime change in Sri Lanka which will bring back the UNP which interoperated with the USA on the global torture campaign. USA is hopeful if the UNP comes to power it will send Lankan troops to fight in Afghanistan. Although the 2001-2004 UNP contribution to the global torture network had minimal domestic effects, a troop commitment to Afghanistan will be cataclysmic. In short, the war in Afghanistan will come home to Colombo.\nDuring many US military operations, Pakistan played a key role. But that mistake condemned them to total ruination. Today even the US attacks Pakistan with drones! Going to Afghanistan is such an unwise approach despite strong American influence to do so.\nIf India falls into this inducement, chaos will rule the world’s largest democracy. Logistical advantages of closer proximity, large unused armed forces, excess capacity of Indian troops, battle experience for Indian troops, US-EU military support to upgrade Indian weapons, concessionary weapons purchases from the US-EU and other sweeteners are not sufficient for India to go to war in Afghanistan. Large scale violence, explosions, attacks and disruptions will derail India if it goes to war. Therefore, India will have to reject the US proposal. Although Indian has been successful in buying time, the clock is ticking as December 2014 approaches fast. Sooner rather than later, USA will demand troops from India. That is when the US-India honeymoon will end.\nIt is better for USA to help disintegration of India as it will give the west more options. Smaller nations, like in former Soviet nations or former Yugoslav nations, will be friendlier with USA in return for protection, favourable trade concessions and geopolitical advantage. As such, when India refuses to play by US rules on Afghanistan, etc., USA will disintegrate India. Indian disintegration will be highly beneficial to India’s neighbours as they could engage with these smaller nations on an equal footing in the absence of the bully. The process itself will be beneficial as it will bring them many global advantages.\nNo one can save Sri Lanka from suicide, if its leaders prefer it . Not giving into 2012 UNHRC demands was a brave move by the administration. Hopefully defiance in the face of foreign threats will continue in 2013 as well. The government must follow a broader approach with a longer time span. As the current geopolitical impasse will pass in another 20 months’ time, Sri Lanka must not hurry into any US, India or UNHRC demand. Tamils in Sri Lanka have equal rights (equal individual rights) and they deserve nothing more. Giving too much rights to Tamils will inflate Tamils into a community of geopolitical clout in the region which is a disaster. Give into no Tamil demand and wait out till the dark clouds of the current geopolitical impasse pass over. The party that can withstand and persevere for the longest, wins this war raged at the UNHRC.\nWe don’t wish the UNHRC majority to vote against the anti-Sri Lanka resolution. We don’t challenge their free choice. But we all wish the Sri Lankan government to totally disregard the two UNHRC resolutions against Sri Lanka and continue its good work to assimilate all Sri Lankans into one nationality.\nDisregard of the 2012 UNHRC resolution pushed it to the rubbish bin of history. Now USA brings another resolution. That too will end in the same bin if the government wisely continues its disregard for UNHRC impositions.\nOne belongs to the other. Fullstop!\nAlthough I understand THE sentiment expressed by S deSilva, my approach is slightly different. We need to understand Indian politics and should be able to communicate with non Tamils. At the moment Tamils have influenced the Government and the racists in TN have won. Unless we are prepared to defend ourselves, we will be vulnerable. Appeasing Tamils will not help us. Unless, the Sinhalse safeguard Lanka, our future generations of Sinhalese will not have a home land. To defend our country, we should be able to think straight. We cannot do that if we blindly follow Buddhism with unproven myths. Further Buddhism does not promote achievement or even self preservation. We should really question if it is worthwhile blindly following Buddhism. We need to get a broader picture of the world. For that we need to free our mind from myths.\nOK. Lets have a scenario.\nSL tells non-Tamilian Indians “SL is doing good”.\nTN Tamilians tell non-Tamilian Indians “SL rapes Tamils”. (This actually happened yesterday in Indian parliament).\nWhat will the non-Tamilian Indians will FINALLY believe?\n1. Because if they don’t, DMK, etc. will vote AGAINST them in parliament! DMK will start their rowdy violence. DMK, etc. will do anti-Indian things MORE. DMK, etc. have parliamentary REPRESENTATION in India and we don’t.\n2. Because the ONLY Indians in SL are Tamilians.\nSo SL can NEVER communicate SUCCESSFULLY to non-Tamilian Indians. They believe what they want to believe. They do what is good for them politically, not SL.\nTamils = India = Tamils.\nI agree with Lorenzo that Tamils have a strong influence in India.b What it means is that Sinhalese need to improve on Finance, economics and defence. We cannot stay idele and prey for extinction.\nshould be able to communicate with non Tamils- eg: Swamy is doing good job in USA !\nMy advice to Chinhala sakotharayas ,invite these Bramin Swamy/ So to colombo give them what they want ( not money they have enogh in their swiss bank a/c ) from our velokada jail (who surrendered in may 2009 ) than they will look after you !!!\nTHESE WORDS OF WISDOM NEED TO BE ADHERED TO ON THE BASIS THAT ~ if there was something tangible towards holding Sri Lanka accountable other than through the lop sided accusations based on cooked up ‘evidence’ that cannot be substantiated the world authorities at the Hague and elsewhere would have already pounced on it big time.",

        "prompt": "TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) — The photocopies of the manual lay in heaps on the floor, in stacks that scaled one wall, like Xeroxed, stapled handouts for a class.\nExcept that the students in this case were al-Qaida fighters in Mali. And the manual was a detailed guide, with diagrams and photographs, on how to use a weapon that particularly concerns the United States: A surface-to-air missile capable of taking down a commercial airplane.\nThe 26-page document in Arabic, recovered by The Associated Press in a building that had been occupied by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu, strongly suggests the group now possesses the SA-7 surface-to-air missile, known to the Pentagon as the Grail, according to terrorism specialists. And it confirms that the al-Qaida cell is actively training its fighters to use these weapons, also called man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, which likely came from the arms depots of ex-Libyan strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi.\nEDITOR'S NOTE — This is the fourth story in an occasional series based on thousands of pages of internal al-Qaida documents recovered by The Associated Press earlier this year in Timbuktu, Mali.\n\"The existence of what apparently constitutes a 'Dummies Guide to MANPADS' is strong circumstantial evidence of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb having the missiles,\" said Atlantic Council analyst Peter Pham, a former adviser to the United States' military command in Africa and an instructor to U.S. Special Forces. \"Why else bother to write the guide if you don't have the weapons? ... If AQIM not only has the MANPADS, but also fighters who know how to use them effectively,\" he added, \"then the impact is significant, not only on the current conflict, but on security throughout North and West Africa, and possibly beyond.\"\nThe United States was so worried about this particular weapon ending up in the hands of terrorists that the State Department set up a task force to track and destroy it as far back as 2006. In the spring of 2011, before the fighting in Tripoli had even stopped, a U.S. team flew to Libya to secure Gadhafi's stockpile of thousands of heat-seeking, shoulder-fired missiles.\nThe manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by Osama bin Laden. It adds to evidence for the weapon found by French forces during their land assault in Mali earlier this year, including the discovery of the SA-7's battery pack and launch tube, according to military statements and an aviation official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment.\nThe knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the French are carrying out their five-month-old offensive in Mali. They are using more fighter jets rather than helicopters to fly above its range of 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) from the ground, even though that makes it harder to attack the jihadists. They are also making cargo planes land and take off more steeply to limit how long they are exposed, in line with similar practices in Iraq after an SA-14 hit the wing of a DHL cargo plane in 2003.\nAnd they have added their own surveillance at Mali's international airport in Bamako, according to two French aviation officials and an officer in the Operation Serval force. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.\nFirst introduced in the 1960s in the Soviet Union, the SA-7 was designed to be portable. Not much larger than a poster tube, it can be packed into a duffel bag and easily carried. It's also affordable, with some SA-7s selling for as little as $5,000.\nThe SA-7 is an old generation model, which means most military planes now come equipped with a built-in protection mechanism against it. But that's not the case for commercial planes, and the threat is greatest to civilian aviation.\n\"This is not a 'Fire and forget' weapon,\" said Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. \"There's a paradox here. One the one hand it's not easy to use, but against any commercial aircraft there would be no defenses against them. It's impossible to protect against it. ... If terrorists start training and learn how to use them, we'll be in a lot of trouble.\"\nIn Timbuktu, SA-7 training was likely part of the curriculum at the 'Jihad Academy' housed in a former police station, said Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for Training and Analysis of Terrorism, one of three experts who reviewed the manual for AP. It's located less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Ministry of Finance's Budget Division building where the manual was found.\nAs the jihadists fled ahead of the arrival of French troops who liberated Timbuktu on Jan. 28, they left the manual behind, along with other instructional material, including a spiral-bound pamphlet showing how to use the KPV-14.5 anti-aircraft machine gun and another on how to make a bomb out of ammonium nitrate, among other documents retrieved by the AP. Residents said the jihadists grabbed reams of paper from inside the building, doused them in fuel and set them alight. The black, feathery ash lay on top of the sand in a ditch just outside the building's gate.\n\"They just couldn't destroy everything,\" said neighbor Mohamed Alassane. \"They appeared to be in a panic when the French came. They left in a state of disorder.\"\nIts pages are numbered 313 through 338, suggesting they came from elsewhere. Mathieu Guidere, an expert on Islamic extremists at the University of Toulouse, believes the excerpts are lifted from the Encyclopedia of Jihad, an 11-volume survey on the craft of war first compiled by the Taliban in the 1980s and later codified by Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, who led a contingent of Arab fighters in Afghanistan at the time, paid to have the encyclopedia translated into Arabic, according to Guidere, author of a book on al-Qaida's North African branch.\nHowever, the cover page of the manual boasts the name of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.\n\"It's a way to make it their own,\" said Guidere. \"It's like putting a logo on something. ... It shows the historic as well as the present link between al",

Jenzen-Jones, an arms expert in Australia, confirmed that the information in the manual in Timbuktu on the missile's engagement range, altitude and weight appeared largely correct. He cautions though that the history of the SA-7 is one of near-misses, specifically because it takes training to use.\nAssociated Press writer Lori Hinnant contributed to this report from Paris, and AP journalist Amir Bibawy translated the document.

Andrew Zuppann of the University of Houston, along with Yona Rubinstein of the London School of Economics, suggests that the more children a family has, the less likely those children will have a good life.\n\"Using a variety of approaches we have documented a significant trade-off between quantity and quality of children for NLSY mothers and their children,\" their new study said. \"On average, children in larger families have lowered parental investment and worse cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes.\"\nUsing data from 1986 to 2012 taken by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and by the Children and Young Adult Survey, the researchers were able to match the number and timing of births into a family to a number of mental and behavioral traits.\nAdditionally, they were able to measure parental engagement with children, such as time spent with each child.\nThey found that in families with more children, parents engaged with each child less. This corresponded with higher likelihoods of poor outcomes for the kids.\n\"Our fixed effect estimates indicate that the arrival of a younger sibling reduces measures of parental investment as well as cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes of older children by approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation,\" the researchers said.\nThe effects were different for girls and boys.

Companies frequently drag out the election date, the union says, so they can run anti-union propaganda campaigns and sometimes harass and even fire union backers before the election.\n“It is ironic that IKEA, which claims it wants everyone to decide for themselves whether to be in the union, decides instead to force the 30 team captains into the unit,” said Street. “There is only one reason for Swedwood to demand the team captains be in the union, and that is to influence the outcome of the election.” Street, in addition to organizing the union’s campaign at the plant, is director of the IAM’s woodworking department.\nIKEA, in an e-mailed response to previous Peoples World articles on the struggle to unionize at Danville, said that it respects its workers right to freedom of association, including their right to join or form unions without fear of reprisal or interference.\n“I guess this doesn’t apply to the Danville workers who do not wish to associate with team captains or team captains who do not wish to associate with the union,” said Street. “It would be interesting to hear how IKEA will defend taking choice away from the workers to decide who they want in their own union,” he added.\nCalls to the company’s public relations office were not returned.\nStreet noted that the IAM was “more than ready” to represent team captains in their own union if they were serious about wanting that representation. “But IKEA has no business interfering in the choice of the hourly non-supervisory workers to have a union of their own choosing,” he declared.\nIncluding the team captains in the voting unit gives IKEA a 10",

Prosecutors dropped a driving under the influence charge for the superstar golfer, and the judge warned him to behave.\n“This particular plea agreement has no jail time on it. However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and then I could sentence you to jail for 90 days with a fine of up to $500, is that understood?” Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo said.\nWoods, 41, nodded. He did not make any statement during the hearing or outside the courthouse.\nWoods will enter a diversion program and spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. He has already met some of the program’s other requirements, completing 50 hours of community service at the Tiger Woods Foundation, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said.\nAronberg didn’t say specifically what Woods did with the charitable group, but said he met the terms of the deal. Woods also attended a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged.\nAronberg said most DUI offenders do not qualify for the diversion program because they have a prior record or were in an accident. About 2,500 first-time offenders have graduated from the county program since it began four years ago.\nSince he was intoxicated with prescription drugs and marijuana, according to court records, he will also be required to undergo regular drug tests. Woods is also not allowed to drink alcohol.\nWoods arrived at the courthouse in a black sport utility vehicle, wearing sunglasses and a dark suit with no tie. Police officers surrounded him as he walked down a hallway inside the courthouse and they ringed the inside of the courtroom during the high-profile proceeding.\nWoods was arrested about 2 a.m. May 29 when officers found him unconscious in his Mercedes, which was parked awkwardly on the roadside and had damage to the driver’s side.\nIt’s not clear how he damaged the car.

        "prompt": "Has iPhone 5 Set Back New Credit Card Payment Technologies?\nIf you have a life, you probably haven&apos;t been following the great Apple iPhone 5/Near-Field Communications (NFC) debate. Good for you. But spare a minute to catch up, because it could -- admittedly a few years down the line -- affect the credit cards in your wallet in a big way.\nWhat&apos;s the big deal with NFC?\nAll the big credit card payment networks (American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa) have over the last year published plans for the introduction into the U.S. of \"EMV\" cards, the ones that have onboard microprocessor chips. These \"roadmaps\" have also included provision for NFC, the technology that allows you to wave or tap an enabled card or smart device near a point-of-sale payment terminal instead of going through the usual swiping process. Mastercard&apos;s PayPass and Visa&apos;s payWave already allow this in the relatively small number of merchant outlets that are currently equipped with NFC terminals.\nHowever, in September, Apple released its iPhone 5. And, unlike some smartphones, it does not come with NFC capabilities. This means that the most anticipated new method of payment terminal checkout just got slighted by Apple. The question is why?\nWill Complaints Over iPhone 5’s Map App Hurt Sales?\nCredit card networks charge merchants a swipe or interchange fee every time a card is swiped, waved or tapped by the customer. Credit card swipe fees are already under threat from legislators who&apos;d like to cap them, just as they did on debit cards in 2011. And anyone who&apos;s now paying for what used to be a free checking account can guess what that could mean for their credit cards. Swipe fees are one of credit card companies&apos; biggest revenue streams, and any significant reduction in their flow could see the widespread introduction of annual fees and a slashing of rewards programs.\nIn a Huffington Post article, Brett King states, \"The problem for the [banking/credit card] industry is that right now we&apos;re doing away with the swipe paradigm altogether, primarily because there wasn&apos;t a rapid enough adoption of NFC-enabled payments. We&apos;ve simply circumvented the poor user experience of the swipe card, for a richer user experience on the mobile device.\"\nMerchants now have alternatives to traditional network swipe fees and adopting services, such as Square and PayPal, which avoid the swipe fee entirely. Starbucks, which in August struck a new deal with Square Inc., a payments provider, has for some time operated its own closed-loop, prepaid, mobile payments app that entirely circumvented the current swipe-fee oligopoly. People like Brett King expect that phenomenon to become increasingly common, and for card issuers&apos; revenues from swipe fees to be slowly whittled away.\nThere is, of course, a continuing debate about the pros and cons of swipe fees. In 2009, the value of those collected just by MasterCard and Visa was between $35 billion and $45 billion, according to a Federal Reserve report. Most of that would have been passed on to card issuers.\nMerchants argue that these fees drive up prices in-",

Under this analysis, the poor and unbanked, who have to pay for everything using cash or even food stamps, are subsidizing through these higher prices the free use of plastic and all those rewards credit cards&apos; goodies for much richer folk.\nBanks and credit card companies contend that cutting swipe fees is only going to transfer a big chunk of their incomes to merchants&apos; bottom lines. They say that there&apos;s no evidence that reducing this cost will result in lower prices at the checkout.\nWho knows which argument is correct? But one of these days we may find out. For now, it appears that Apple may be betting mobile wallet apps that include a payment provider will soon be dominating the mobile payment field.

        "prompt": "Consider this: Regulators such as the Federal Reserve had 48 hours of warning before the fall of AIG. They had 72 hours before the collapse of Bear Stearns. The system's most powerful watchdogs had no idea that the most dangerous firms were ticking time bombs. And as we know, when the bombs went off, they had no idea what to do. Chris Dodd's financial-regulation proposal (pdf) is an effort to make sure they're never caught unaware, or unprepared, again.\nInsofar as Dodd's proposal has a clear theory of the case and its solution, it's this: At every point in the chain of events that led to the financial crisis, there was a crucial information deficit. Consumers didn't understand the products they were buying. Regulators didn't understand the banks they were regulating (and, in some cases, not regulating). There were non-bank players such as AIG that had become central to the system but that few were watching. And no one understood what to do when the banks collapsed. At the most basic level, Dodd's bill is an effort to make sure the absence of information never leads to a financial crisis again. The question is whether that's enough.\nIt's easy to forget that the financial crisis began with one subprime mortgage, sold to one consumer, at a time. That's the argument behind the Consumer Financial Products Bureau. Housed in the Federal Reserve (a significant defeat for advocates), the CFPB will be run by a presidential appointee, funded through a dedicated budget, and empowered to write new rules on its own. Supporters of the initiative -- including Elizabeth Warren, who first came up with the idea -- believe that Dodd's bill retains the CFPB's independence. They worry, however, that housing it in the Federal Reserve means it's only one amendment away from becoming a servant of the Federal Reserve -- and the Fed has a terrible track record regulating consumer products.\nIf it survives, the point of the CFPB, as one supporter explains it, is to \"make contracts comprehensible again.\" That's it. No one expects it to have the power to force companies to offer so-called \"plain vanilla\" products. But if it can bring contracts down to two pages from 10; if it can standardize how these products are presented so people can make informed decisions; if it can end the \"teaser culture\" in which the low initial costs are in bold letters and the dangers are confined to a jargon-filled footnote on page 6; maybe it can do some good.\nBut that's a lot of \"ifs,\" and I should admit my skepticism: Would more prominent disclosure of prepayment penalties and interest hikes have averted the subprime crisis? How do we keep individual brokers from de-emphasizing them?\nWhat might have averted the crisis was regulators who recognized not only the building pressure on bank balance sheets, but the risk that individual firms posed to the entire system. That will be the job of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The FSOC -- which is really fun to say aloud, incidentally -- will be made up of nine federal regulators, one independent appointee, and chaired by the secretary of the Treasury. It will be staffed by a new Office of Financial Research inside the Treasury Department that'll be, at base, a data-gathering operation.\nThe FSOC -- \"fff-SOK!\" -- will be charged with watching banks (think Bank of America) and non-bank actors (think AIG) of systemic importance and making recommendations about what the Federal Reserve should do with them. The council can recommend \"increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management.\" It can bring non-bank entities under the Federal Reserve's regulatory umbrella. Working with the Federal Reserve, it can break up systemically dangerous institutions, or force them to divest themselves of holdings or end certain business practices. But a lot of this is dependent on not just the council's decisions but on the Federal Reserve's agreement.\nIf all works well, the FSOC will alert regulators to problems in systemically important institutions before they threaten to consume the host. But if not, the bill creates an orderly process the FDIC can use to shut down failing institutions. In it, shareholders and unsecured creditors bear losses and management loses their jobs. It also gives them a roadmap for how to do it: Systemically important institutions will have to produce so-called \"funeral plans\" laying out exactly how they could be shut down if it came to that. No more late-night confusion at the Federal Reserve.\nAnd one important proviso to all of this: The derivatives section in the proposal is not the one that will be in Dodd's final bill. It's a placeholder for the derivative-regulation package that Judd Gregg and Jack Reed are working to build. But unless there's transparency in derivatives, there can't be transparency in balance sheets. \"Derivatives reform is intimately tied to the functioning of the entire system,\" says the Roosevelt Institution's Rob Johnson, a former chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee. \"If derivatives reform is done well, it creates clarity in how much capital a firm has and whether they’re impaired or not. In the absence of derivatives reform, everything remains muddy. A lot will live or die around that point.\"\nBut assume the derivatives piece comes out okay. This, then, is the core of the bill. Regulators get more and better information and more and better powers. The question is whether that's a good theory for this legislation. And I don't think it is.\nOne of the lessons of the financial crisis is that you can lead a regulator to information, but you can't make him drink. Imagine a world in which Alan Greenspan helms the Federal Reserve, in which George W. Bush appoints the Treasury Secretary, and in which the consensus is that the data showing we've abandoned historical economic trends are explained away because the sophisticated new products that few understand have effectively hedged away the risks. If that sounds familiar, it should. We're living through the aftermath. And if there's anything this bill should protect against, it's the factors that led to the most recent crisis.\nBut this bill gives those failed regulators more power and autonomy, not less. It deals with the information that they didn't have and it deals with the authority they didn't have, but it doesn't deal with their failure to want to regulate. \"If you had omniscient, courageous regulators who experience no feedback, disapproval, negative press, or anger from powerful people, they could make this work,\" says Johnson. But we don't.\nThe alternative to relying on regulators would have been laying down automatic protections. Consider FDIC deposit insurance: It doesn't matter whether Ben Bernanke thinks Bank of America is doing a good job, or whether Bank of America makes a case that they can protect consumers another way. The insurance is simply there. It's one of the rules of the road. And we haven't had a serious bank run since its inception.\nConversely, this bill doesn't set, say, any specific capital requirements. Dodd isn't saying that banks with assets over $500 billion, or banks that are ruled systemically important, are limited to a 15:1 debt-to-capital ratio. That leaves the possibility that regulators will decide not to impose sufficient capital requirements when they're caught up in the next boom cycle.\nDodd's argument is that Congress should not micromanage the financial sector. But the problem isn't an abundance of micromanagement, but an absence of macromanagement. In bubble times, regulators have bubble mindsets. We who've just experienced the pain of a burst need to lay down some rules that'll hold even when irrational exuberance comes back for another visit.\nThe FDIC example brings up another point: After the Great Depression, we changed the banking market such that the problem that created the financial crisis (mistrust in banks leading to bank runs) would never happen again. We're not doing that here. \"There isn’t any real structural change to the finance sector,\" says Demos's Heather McGhee. \"It is so vastly different from what it was even 10 years ago, with most of the funding for financial firms coming from bizarre, complicated capital market products that are very attenuated from real sources of funding. But it’s all untouched.\"\nDodd, of course, is working in a 60-vote environment, not a land of his own imagination. So the bill is a compromise with political realities, and it will be compromised further still. Which is a scary prospect. Because at some point, this thing either works or it doesn't. As it stands, the bill seems like a very good thing for regulators who know they're in a financial crisis, and the new institutions meant to watch systemic risk and gather information may help regulators realize when they're headed in that direction. But if they don't -- and history suggests that they won't -- this bill does very little to protect us in their absence.\nTo put it another way, regulators would have been better off if this bill had passed before they had to respond to the financial crisis, but it's hard to say that the presence of this bill would have prevented the crisis.\n\"If it survives, the point of the CFPB, as one supporter explains it, is to \"make contracts comprehensible again.\" That's it. No one expects it to have the power to force companies to offer so-called \"plain vanilla\" products. But if it can bring contracts down to two pages from 10; if it can standardize how these products are presented so people can make informed decisions\"\nNot for nothing but if you're buying a home and can't read 10 pages or understand 10 pages maybe you shouldn't be buying a home.\nExactly how do you expect to \"enforce\" how they're presented?\nI understand you can't have unscrupulous mortgage bankers trying to make a quick buck but you also have to have new homeowners that buy within their means and stay there.\nAs you state regulation's been there (but not to this extent) but they have to WANT TO regulate.\n\"the bill creates an orderly process the FDIC can use to shut down failing institutions. In it, shareholders and unsecured creditors bear losses and management loses their jobs.\"\nThe FDIC already does this, all the time, doesn't it? What would this bill change about this function of the FDIC?\nyes, nice job of work Ezra. Macro management indeed. It was at the macro level that the system collapsed.\nI don't think we need to worry too much about people buying homes within their means, for example - it was the credit industry itself that deliberately enlarged those means. This proceeded from a systemic culture of arbitrage that could tolerate no slowdowns or limits to growth, by hook or by crook.\nThat culture is still reflected today in the $60 trillion of derivatives at large in the global economy, a sum roughly equal to the productive global economy itself.\nThe world of course can't call in this kind of gambling marker, not when the world itself is the stake. All we can do is plug the little holes that appear (using real wealth) as various players have fainting spells. Occasionally a lone player is carried to the bench.\nWhat we need - exactly as one could infer from your scepticism - is hard-coded laws that mandate the macro percentages of risk and collateral and segregate the instruments and the industries beyond discretionary choice.\nThen we could use something like the FBI to handle the regulation.\nSo the problem to be addressed lives at the macro political end of things, and this requires a large swell of public awareness coupled with some legislators who haven't been too badly bought. I have great faith in the first, but the second? There's that rub again.\nWell, it was none of their business anyway, and piling on more stupid laws still won't make it any of their business.\nAnd it's none of your business, Klein.\nGo run your own insurance co/bank or whatever if you want to, but keep your stupid nose out of everyone else's biz. You're like a reeking old washer woman, worried about everyone except your own reeking self.\n\"Who is Senator Kaufman and what power does he have in this situation? He is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee – and if you think this is a regulatory issue, that reduces the weight of his voice.\n\"But he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and we are discussing here potential crimes – or what should be crimes if the legal system still functioned. He was also a cosponsor of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) – which was right on topic – and is an experienced Capitol Hill insider who has studied these issues long and hard. He has also worked closely, over many years, with Vice President Biden.\n\"The tide is turning, but not primarily through the actions of Senator Dodd and his Banking colleagues. Rather the biggest and most unruly players in our financial system have behaved in such an egregious manner that they will be brought down by the law – either that, or they will further bring down the law.\"\nAh, now that HCR is finally about to be born, or laid to rest, glad to see you're turning to Finance Reform.\nI second rosshunter's pointer to baselinescenario.com (for anyone who's interested) and would add Rortybomb (Mike Konzcal) to that. Both sites have excellent information about the meltdown, its causes, and what needs to be done.\nBaseline guys are none to thrilled with Dodd's proposal, think it's weak and misses critical issues, and placing the CFPA at Fed is laughable, like putting one red consumer hot-line phone in the basement of the Fed building.\nRortybomb cleverly decided it would be more instructive to compare Dodd's proposal to a Fin Reform package created by Rs rather than the House version. Sure 'nough, very similar. Once again, we get watered-down legislation to appease some Rs, but no R-votes in exchange. This is really getting old.\n\"Consider FDIC deposit insurance: It doesn't matter whether Ben Bernanke thinks ...\"\n1. When did Bernanke go to work for the FDIC?\n2. Admit it -- you know next to nothing about how the FDIC operates. Before you opine at length on bank regulation, perhaps you ought to learn something about it.\nMichael Hirsch makes the following point about derivatives: \"What needs to be addressed is not so much what kind of products are out there but the way they are traded. The real mischief occurs when credit default swaps and other arcane derivatives are privately negotiated",
        "baseline": " out of sight of regulators.\"\nYa because people didn't take out 2nd and third mortgages to try to \"keep up with the Jonses\". That didn't happen???\nSure the rest of what you say is correct but disputing my point show you only want to pass blame to industry and not to everyone responsible.\nSo we need both law and regulation, but we also need a framework for laws and regulations to co-evolve with the latest financial \"innovations\". And some kind of career path so that joining the other team isn't the only way for a regulator to ensure a comfortable retirement.\nIt also might help to have a culture in which so many people didn't measure their worth in financial terms and compete to be the biggest, in which morality, in addition to the law, was some kind of check on greed.\nBut we don't have that, and as long as these predators are celebrated and excused, the rest of society will suffer.",

For years, AIG had been able to hide this exposure from regulators and the public. Had the swaps been traded on an exchange, the risk would have been transparent and AIG would have been forced to post collateral to cover its exposure. Knowing the risk, regulators could have forced AIG to raise capital or sell off its derivatives business.

The corollary is that anyone who answers an unanswerable question will be awarded a Nobel prize. One such Nobel prize winning question is “Why does matter exist?” or more precisely why wasn’t matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities at the beginning of the universe? We know this cannot be true because matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities would have annihilated to form a universe that consisted solely of radiation. The problem is that our understanding of fundamental physics predicts just that – matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities. Theoretical physicists believe the answer lies in symmetry breaking in the early universe but experiments have yet to find results that allow physicists to distinguish between competing models of symmetry breaking.\nHowever, this may change with recent particle physics experiments performed at Fermi lab. In their experiment they measured how fast the Bs meson oscillated between matter and anti-matter. They discovered that the particle oscillates between the two states 17 to 21 times per picosecond.

If you don’t know what a femto-barn is, you are not alone. It turns out to be a measure of a particle cross-section (10-39 m2). The smaller the particles cross-section, the more collisions you need to observe before you are sure you detect it.

        "prompt": "On September 26th, more than 1,000 new and returning members from the public, private and non-profit sectors, including some of the world&apos;s largest corporations, will come together at the 11th Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York City to address some of the world&apos;s most pressing challenges. We&apos;re proud that this year&apos;s CGI Annual Meeting is being supported by 33 new and returning sponsors, including some world&apos;s largest corporations and most effective foundations -- Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Cisco, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Ford Foundation, Gap Inc., NRG Energy, Swiss Reinsurance Company, the Rockefeller Foundation and Western Union. In addition, Apple, GlaxoSmith Kline, Xerox and Cardinal Health will participate in CGI as members for the first time. In 2005, when President Clinton launched CGI, his goal was to turn ideas about how to improve the world into tangible action. He asked each GCI member to make a “Commitment to Action\" - a new and measurable plan to tackle a global issue - often collaborating with other CGI members across sectors to assist with the design and implementation. Since inception, CGI members have answered President Clinton’s call by making more than 3,200 Commitments to Action which have improved the lives of over 430 million people in more than 180 countries - many of these by our corporate members and sponsors. At CGI, corporations not only provide funding, but also apply their expertise in management, technology, manufacturing, distribution and research to help non-governmental organizations and foundations be more effective. These corporate commitments are providing better access to education and healthcare in the developing world, creating jobs and improving infrastructure in the U.S, and protecting the environment. Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, has been a key partner, making several CGI commitments to provide safe, clean drinking water to millions in the developing world. P&G has scaled up production of clean water packets and is distributing them around the world with the help of NGOs working in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Through these commitments, the company has already provided 7.5 billion liters of clean water at no cost to those who need it most in more than 70 countries worldwide. Separately, the Inter-American Development Bank is working with corporate partners, including Microsoft, Caterpillar, and Walmart, to implement an employment program across ten Latin American countries. This CGI commitment will help 500,000 disadvantaged youth enter the workforce over the next five years. CGI’s unique model of cross-sector collaboration has helped change the way many corporations approach their corporate social responsibility efforts and mirrors a shift in how foundations and NGOs are adopting best practices of management and measurement from the corporate sector, so it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise that organizations that care about being good global citizens choose to support CGI in a non-partisan way. Despite our mission, some have characterized the turnover of a handful of CGI’s sponsors as “trouble” for CGI and \"abandoning\" the Clintons, but this is just another example of critics trying to politicize philanthropy, and the facts don’t bear out the argument.

In fact, our turnover rate was lower this year than other years. And even those who aren&apos;t returning as sponsors continue to implement the commitments they launched through CGI. President Clinton often says that no one sector, organization or individual can solve the world&apos;s seemingly intractable problems alone, and that in an increasingly interconnected world, it takes collaboration to make meaningful change.

It is a great kite flying mechanism and there are some good people on it,'' said Neil Russ, leader of Buddle Finlay's tax practice.\nThere have been many tax reviews before, including the McLeod report.\n``The difference this time is that there really is a need,'' said Mr Russ.\n``I believe the revenue officials are very concerned about rental property investors taking tax deductions,'' Mr Russ said.\nOften tax was a significant factor in decisions people made about investing in rental property.\nRents often did not cover the cost of mortgages in rental properties and the difference was being bridged by the public in the form of tax break to owners.\nThis was the sort of issue the group was likely to address, he said. Another possibility was some sort of wealth tax at a low level.\nMr English has said any changes to the taxation system would have to be cost neutral, meaning revenue gained in any one area would be offset by reductions elsewhere.\nIn working papers the group advocated a land tax over a capital gains tax, on the basis of simplicity.\nIt noted New Zealand's 30 percent corporate tax compared to an average rate of 26 percent for small OECD countries.\nProfessor Bob Buckle, the group's chairman, has said that about $500 million in net losses was",

According to new research, the peatlands are much larger than originally estimated.\nThe record peatlands comprise 56,000 square miles, larger than the state of New York.\n\"Our research shows that the peat in the central Congo Basin covers a colossal amount of land,\" Simon Lewis, a professor at the University of Leeds, said in a news release. \"It is 16 times larger than the previous estimate and is the single largest peatland complex found anywhere in the tropics.\"\nBeneath the surface, the peatlands are hiding 30 billion tons of carbon.\n\"These peatlands hold nearly 30 percent of the world's tropical peatland carbon, that's about 20 years of the fossil fuel emissions of the United States of America,\" Lewis added.\nPeat is the type of soil commonly found in wetlands.

Born on June 24, 1900, he died at age 59.\nBut during this too-short life, turbulent with activism on behalf of a cause he worked toward all of his adult life, Rafael Lemkin changed the world.\nAs part of this project, he worked hard to convince the United Nations to pay more attention to the issue of crimes against humanity as a violation of international law. The result was the United Nations Convention against Genocide, written by Lemkin and approved by the General Assembly on December 1948, a day before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN.\nWhen Professor Richard Brietman of American University, speaking at a July 5 Conversation on Human Rights sponsored by the Washington Friends Meeting (FMW--its committee on religious education) and the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL), said that Lemkin deserved more credit in his efforts toward human rights than did Eleanor Roosevelt, so key to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I sat up with a jolt.\nI knew his name but not his fame. This early student of linguistics, studying the history of recent mass oppression--in Armenia, Syria, and the Ukraine, respectively, in the early twentieth century--coined a term in 1943 to describe not only whole-scale slaughter of a race, genos in Greek, but the accompanying decimation of the relevant cultures and mores, genocide. He needed--we all needed--a term to describe not only such hideous events of the past but the holocaust in progress in Germany and Eastern Europe against Jews and other minorities. The second root in the term, -cide, has the meaning \"killing, cutting down.\"\nIn 1933, presenting his case to a League of Nations conference in Madrid, Lemkin had used the term barbarity.\nPower of the word. It grows slowly. In 1944, said Brietman, a Gallup poll conducted in the United States revealed that the public thought that about 100,000 Jews had been murdered by the Germans. The press hadn't written much. The reality of the six million came later, as the Allies discovered the numerous concentration camps writhing with corpses living and dead.\nPhotographs of the atrocity, taken by both Germans and their enemies, were a compelling part of the evidence presented at the Nuremberg Trial in 1945, where crimes against humanity was one of four charges filed against twenty-two of the most powerful German agents of the slaughter. Another of them, Adolf Eichmann, discovered in Argentina in 1960 and tried and condemned soon after in Israel, revealed how many had been murdered, that figure of six million that haunts the world deeply to this day.\nThe charge considered most significant of the four, said Brietman, was crimes against peace.\nA crime against peace as well as a another genocide of six million, in the years 1932--1933 and surrounding, of Ukrainians by the Soviet Union via starvation of these inhabitants of the \"world's granary,\" was publicized and analyzed by Lemkin in the early 1950s. The Ukrainians, a sovereign culture unrelated to the Russians, had risen up in an effort toward full independence from the Communist tyranny.\nAlthough protests against this atrocity had been held in New York City by surviving Ukrainians in 1933 and 1953--Lemkin having delivered a moving address at the latter--it was not until 2008 that his analysis of the events was publicized, including his perspective on genocide as encompassing more than people, but everything else that their existence signified, everything that distinguished them from other cultures, peoples, mores, and gifts",

Despite the publicity such horrors generate sooner or later, after their occurrence genocide continues to occur: most recently in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur . . .\nWhen will the list end? How do we combat this hideous disease named by Lemkin?\nNo law can prevent its own violation, the audience of the FCNL/FMW Conversation was informed, though disciplinary institutions sprang up in the wake of World War II and human rights had been a concern of the League of Nations.

        "prompt": "Editor's note: This article is a part of a series reviewing Utah history for KSL.com's Historic section.\nCOALVILLE — NaVee Vernon seemed unconcerned about the snowflakes swirling around her as she eagerly led a group of about a dozen state, county and local officials up a hill toward Coalville Ledge.\nVernon didn’t have time to complain about the poor weather. This was her opportunity to share with others her hometown gem and a forgotten piece of Utah history.\n“I’ve always loved where I’ve lived — but look out there from this ledge … What do you see? It’s beautiful,” Vernon said, sitting on a pile of sandstone near the top of the ledge, which separates the small city of about 1,300 from Echo Reservoir.\nFrom this spot, there’s a serene view of the surrounding mountains and the sprawling farm plots within the valley. One of the officials points out an osprey that rests on a tree near Chalk Creek, which flows adjacent to the ledge.\nOf course, the scenic view is not what brought these officials to the area Tuesday afternoon.\nVernon, with the Summit County Historical Society, co-led a tour with the Utah Division of State History to show members of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Utah Division of Indian Affairs, the North Summit School District (who owns the land where the ledge is) and other agencies the petroglyphs painted and scratched on the ledge surface. They’re concerned because this spot, enjoyed by many for thousands of years, is jeopardized by a growing amount of graffiti and extreme weather patterns.\nWith the reservoir opening as Utah’s newest state park likely bringing more people to Coalville this summer, Utah State History officials are hoping to educate others about this ignored piece of history before it’s completely destroyed.\n“This has been a really well-kept secret and we’re really excited to roll it out in a more public way with the proper attention, care and reverence,” said Elizabeth Hora, an archaeologist with Utah Division of State History.\nThe group pauses about 100 feet from the trailhead, where Hora and Shawn Lambert, another archaeologist with Utah Division of State History, point out tiny scratches on the ledge not far from an opening where an aqueduct once ran through the ledge.\nSome of these images are believed to date back thousands of years, where others from Ute and Shoshoni tribes date back to 800 years ago. There’s also etches from Utah’s early pioneers and townspeople in the 19th and 20th centuries. Vernon laughs, saying that she found her uncle’s name on the walls.\nThe group moves up the path to where there are a few faded human and animal-shaped pictographs — painted rock art — on the wall. They have red ochre and orange-yellow paint, and officials date them to 200 to 1300 A.D. because of the headdresses depicted in the art.\n“We think they may have been mixing it on the spot and applying it to the rock as paint,” she said, grabbing dirt from the ledge and mashing the powder in her palm.\nSome of the art compares with petroglyphs in Vernal and more in Colorado.\nFinding this art can be a difficult task. In fact, some of it isn’t even noticed until the group is headed back down the trail and new art is found each trip out, changing the timeframe of the art.\n“With rock art, light is so important because you can come here three times and never see it. When the light is perfect, boom! It pops,” Christopher Merritt, deputy state historic preservation officer with Utah Division of State History, said.\nThen there’s spray-paint graffiti, which began appearing at the ledge in the 1970s. Since then, people have left everything from love messages to profanity.\nMerritt convened the group on Tuesday to help teach them about the ledge’s history. Many who knew about the ledge hadn’t heard that it had petroglyphs dating as far back as 200 A.D.\nHe stressed the site differs from the hundreds of the state’s other petroglyph sites because of its location in Summit County instead of central or southern Utah. There is currently no state plan on the docket to protect the ledge.\nHowever, with some eyes on protecting similar rock art in Utah County that has been inadvertently damaged from gunfire, state historians wanted to show that there’s more threatened rock art in Utah.\n“There are no set plans (right now).

However, she conceded not all graffiti has been bad, since it has brought generations of people together to the ledge.\nIn fact, that’s perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the area.

An air breathing target could be any missile that requires the intake of air for combustion.\nThe radar can also double as an air traffic control system.\nThe highly mobile G/ATOR system will aid the Corps’ mission in the Pacific where its forces will be decentralized, operating on remote islands and floating bases.\nThe air and missile threat to the Corps is very real, especially in the Pacific where China has been busy advancing its ballistic missile capability.\nThe threat prompted a high-",

        "prompt": "Memo to Conservatives, New Democrats and others who are crowing about how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears to have been revealed as a harsher and less cuddly politician than he has been thought to be till now: Be careful what you wish for.\nIf Trudeau is revealed as a tough guy who is not particularly nice to his MPs, under a mere veneer of sensitivity, Canadians, who have a history of liking tough leaders like the current PM's Dear Ole Dad, may like him better.\nIt's certainly true that the version of Trudeau now emerging from the wreckage of the SNC-Lavalin affair shows him as not quite the warm and fuzzy high school drama teacher we were all so keen on when we were justifiably hell bent on getting rid of Stephen Harper. This is true even if Trudeau can still summon up a tear when circumstances warrant.\nBut the fact is, the recent record suggests Canadians don't mind tough leaders. In fact, they may prefer them. Consider Harper himself, and Jean Chrétien, two of the more obvious electoral successes in recent Canadian political history.\nNor do Canadians seem to mind politicians switching their narrative from idealistic to tough -- consider the old block himself, whence Justin Trudeau was chipped.\nAs a youth, I heard Pierre Trudeau speak before he had yet won the Liberal leadership. He sounded coolly intellectual and warmly idealistic, but he had not yet revealed the steel at his core. However, if any of us had really been paying attention we might have sensed it there.\nWhat's more, despite claims to the contrary, Canadian voters apparently don't mind serial liars, an extreme lack of diplomacy or even an apparent degree of corruption in their politicians, as long as they give the impression of being tough enough. Consider the recent success of Doug Ford in Ontario and the apparent popularity of Jason Kenney here in Alberta, if the latest poll touted by the Calgary Herald, which acts as Kenney's personal publicity department, is anything to go by.\nConsider the late Jim Prentice, premier of Alberta, who, among other things, didn't appear to be as tough as the NDP's Rachel Notley as election day neared in May 2015. Andrew Scheer, do you hear the wind whispering your name?\nSo don't be too surprised if Canadians don't mind all that much if Trudeau lets a new, steelier persona more like his late father's emerge.\nRight now, we are told, Trudeau's personal popularity has taken a hit. But if I were a Liberal strategist, I would not panic about that, driven as it is by nearly hysterical tweeting by Conservative operatives -- the inspiration for which Scheer's Conservative Party strategic advisers take from their Trumpian Republican mentors south of the imaginary line, and perhaps others.\nMore than one side can tweet,",

        "prompt": "Funding of technical training for jobs that don't require college degrees has plummeted since the 1980s, but a new crop of programs show promise by being more responsive to local businesses.\nAn A+ course in Cincinnati in July 2015. Here, students are working on hardware configuration and repair.\nJoe Easley has cycled through so many jobs since graduating high school nine years ago that it’s hard to imagine his career is just beginning.\nThere was a brief stint as operations supervisor for a Steak 'n Shake restaurant in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. There were jobs at several call centers, selling phones at AT&T and Verizon stores, and as a customer service rep at JPMorgan Chase.\nIn between, he started (and didn’t finish) a handful of college degree programs, completed a certificate in broadcasting, and even joined the Air Force.\n“I was desperately trying to find the right path for me,” Mr. Easley tells The Christian Science Monitor.\nHe finally hit his stride last year after completing a free training program in information technology (IT) skills. There was a high demand for such skills from local businesses; before even receiving his certification, Easley was entertaining possible jobs at Time Warner Cable and with a defense contractor. Salary offers were coming in at $43,000 per year – twice as much as he had ever earned.\nEasley’s story is far from unique. A growing body of evidence is showing promising career results for people who train in moderately technical skills that employers in manufacturing, IT, and healthcare say they desperately need.\nCalled “sector-based” or \"skills-based\" training, this model – of finding out what jobs community businesses need to fill and training people for them – has the potential to re-invigorate workforce development at a precarious time in the country’s economy, supporters say. According to employers and economists, there aren’t enough workers with the right skills to fill the plethora of jobs, from machinists to health technicians, that don’t require a college degree. That's why twenty-one states now use sector-based training to plug those skills gaps in their local labor markets.\nThe model also has gained national political traction in recent years. President Obama, once a staunch proponent of college-for-all, has devoted more attention to training workers for existing, unfilled jobs in his second term.\nAs a Virginia senator, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine introduced legislation last year to make more Pell Grant dollars, which help fund education for low-income students, available for short-term skills training. Hillary Clinton has a set of proposals for skills training, and said in her DNC speech in July that training for existing jobs would be a priority.\nThe model is by no means perfect. It can serve only a limited number of workers who have certain qualities, such as an aptitude for math, or the constitution to work in certain medical jobs. There’s also the threat of training people for specific skills that may not easily transfer to other industries if the labor market changes.\n“There are some major challenges involved in bringing these programs to a scale sufficient to really improve outcomes for less-educated workers, while maintaining program quality,” Georgetown University economist Harry J. Holzer wrote in a 2015 analysis for the US Department of Labor. Still, he concluded, those challenges can be overcome.\nAccording to the National Skills Coalition, a Washington-based career-training advocacy group, the need for workers in middle-skilled jobs in the US will remain one of the economy’s most pronounced in the near term.\nIndeed, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a surplus of bachelor’s degrees in the workforce, while moderately skilled positions languish.\nMiddle-skill jobs — jobs that require more than a high school diploma but not a four-year degree — make up 54 percent of jobs in the US economy. But only 44 percent of US workers are trained at the middle-skill level.\nThrough 2022, the share of high-skill jobs, including lawyers and doctors, is expected to stay stagnant at 31 percent, the skills coalition estimates. The number of middle-skilled jobs, which call for training but no college degree, will continue to make up the bulk of work, though dropping slightly from 54 to 49 percent in the next six years.\nBesides helping employers, studies show that skills-based training gives an earnings boost to workers in the middle of the economy, which has been hardest-hit by a shift in the labor market that makes it much harder to earn a living wage without post-secondary education.\nFor instance, a June brief describing a controlled study of 2,600 low-wage workers reported a 14-percent rise, on average, in annual earnings – or $1,945 – for those who completed a skills-based training program. Researchers from MDRC, the public-policy organization that conducted the survey, characterized the findings as an “encouraging” indicator of their effectiveness.\nEasley had the kind of success the model was built for. His free, eight-week training in A+, a certification for computer technicians, was organized by the Ohio branch of New York City-based nonprofit Per Scholas, a pioneer in the field of IT career training for low-income workers. Besides computer skills, Per Scholas teaches how to evaluate benefits packages, ask for raises, and navigate the uncertain path of career advancement.\nPer Scholas was one of four nonprofits in New York City, Cleveland, and Tulsa, Okla. to participate in MDRC’s research. The nonprofit raised annual earnings for its workers by 26 percent, or about $3,700.\nOther nonprofits showed weaker results, partly because it took them time to build relationships with local businesses, says MDRC. In some cases, it was because they trained people for jobs that were plentiful when the study began, but disappeared by the time it was over.\nThat’s what happened to Austin Rhine, a participant in the MDRC study based in Tulsa. Less than a year after training and getting placed in a job as a CNC (computer numeric controlled) machinist at McKissick, a manufacturer of equipment for the oil and gas industry, he was laid off with a wave of cutbacks.\n“I was just kind of bummed,” says Mr. Rhine.\nThe oil glut that has sent oil prices plummeting in recent years has devastated the oil and gas industry in Oklahoma, which drives the local economy. Thousands of people have lost jobs in the Tulsa region as energy companies have downsized or gone bust.\nRhine is emblematic of one of the biggest drawbacks to sector-based training: the threat of training people for very specific jobs skills that may not be transferable to other industries.\nHappily, Rhine’s skills proved useful beyond oil and gas. He was a good at math and a hard worker, impressing his instructors so much that he snagged the McKissick position just a couple of months into his four-month training program. Madison was able to find him a job as a machinist for an aerospace manufacturer within a couple of weeks of his being laid off.\nThe nonprofit now is steering its CNC machinist training program towards aerospace manufacturing, an industry expected to grow for years in the region.\n“I think there’s no greater sin than training people that desperately need a higher income and better career opportunities in an industry where they can’t work,” says Ms. Pennington.\nResponding to the changing needs of local businesses is key to the success of demand-based training programs, say advocates of the model. But until recently, it wasn’t standard practice in the workforce development field.\nMeanwhile, although the number of college graduates has grown, businesses have complained they can’t find workers for moderately technical jobs.\n“I spent an entire year going to high schools and junior high schools talking to classes and explaining that you don’t have to go to college if you’re not on the college path,” says Kenneth Statton, who hired Madison’s trainees at M&M Manufacturing, an aerospace manufacturer in Tulsa, which he sold last year.\nMr. Statton was part of a coalition of local business leaders working with high schools, nonprofits like Madison, and community colleges to build a pipeline of workers for the manufacturing industry. They targeted kids who weren’t likely to go to college.\n“The realization came in 2008 to 2009 that if we were going to, as a group of manufacturers in this region, get the qualified help we needed, we were going to have to train it ourselves,” says Statton.\nIn addition to keeping up with the twists and turns of the labor market, modern skills training programs face another major challenge: funding. Federal investment in skills training has declined by an estimated 83 percent between 1980 and 2008, largely because federal programs from past decades, which taught general skills and polished resumes, were found to be ineffective.\nIn 2014, President Obama signed a renewal of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which made sector training a requirement for states. But the law allocated 43 percent less funding than the previous renewal, 16 years earlier. Today, the government doles out $2.7 billion for workforce development annually, compared with $4.74 billion in 2000, adjusted for inflation.\nAt the same time, increasing access to college has become more of a priority. In today's dollars, subsidies in the form of federal Pell Grants have ballooned from about $10 billion distributed every year to students in 2000 to about $30 billion in 2016. Only 4 percent of this money goes to middle-skill career training, estimates the National Skills Coalition.\nSkills-training advocates say",
        "baseline": " that while they don’t propose cutting funding for college, they would like to see more grants available for people for whom college might not be an option.\nBut some, including Donald E. Heller, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, worry that diverting more Pell funds to technical training programs could mean less money going to help low-income students fund college.\nOn an individual level, at least, skills training has been a vital source of encouragement for the workers they have reached. Though Easley still hopes to finish college some day, he says the support he got from Per Scholas was life-changing.\n“One thing that a lot of people don’t understand is that if you grow up in a low-income situation you may not have that home support, that mom or dad that says, ‘You can do it, Johnny, you can do whatever you put your mind to, I believe in you,'” he says.",

They point to the success of the Workforce Innovation Fund, a $500 million program that the Department of Labor launched in 2011 to fund innovative workforce development programs. The fund has supported 30 programs in 20 states, including the MDRC study.\nThe fund has been a “game changer” for the sector-based training model, says Mr. Holzer, the Georgetown economist.\nThe fund has also helped to build a network of nonprofits that are now working together to share best practices and expand their reach.
