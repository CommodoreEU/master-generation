What is Newton's first law of motion?,1st law: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.,1st law: A body will remain at rest or in uniform motion along a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it. Resistance to motion is called force. Resisting motion causes acceleration if it is not balanced by equal reaction. Resisting action causes no change if it is balanced by equal reaction. Resisting action causes slowing if it is more than equal reaction. Resisting action causes stopping if it is exactly equal reaction. Resisting action causes moving in direction it is acting with velocity equal or more than velocity equal reaction is acting with.
