Formula 1 cars are among the fastest accelerating machines ever made by man and have a maximum speed limit of around 220 km/h (136 mph). Formula 1 cars are also among the smallest and lightest race cars around, making them ideal for racing and maneuvering at high spears. Formula 1 cars are also among the most advanced racing cars thanks to a combination of aerodynamics and advanced automated features that allow racers to adjust various parameters according to track and weather conditions as well as their own personal preferences. Formula 1 cars also feature advanced safety measures and are among the safest racing cars available today thanks to a combination of advanced safety features and a variety of safety measures taken during races and practice sessions. Finally Formula 1 cars are also among the least affordable racing cars available today as a combination of advanced automation and safety features make Formula 1 cars an expensive affair overall.
