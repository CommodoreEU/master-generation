It is most likely to occur in people age 60 and older.\nRadiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays to treat cancer, and was the first curative therapy for lymphoma. Radiation therapy has a long history as the preferred treatment in early-stage follicular lymphoma; however, despite strong supporting evidence, it has been replaced by alternative management strategies including observation without initial treatment and novel systemic therapies.\n\"Our study highlights the increasing omission of radiation therapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and its associated negative effect on overall survival at a national level. This increasing bias towards the omission of radiation therapy is despite proven efficacy and increasing adoption of lower radiation therapy doses and more modern radiation therapy techniques which decrease risk of side effects,\" said Austin Vargo, M.D., a radiation oncologist at UPMC CancerCenter, partner with the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and lead author of the study. \"More patients should be offered this effective yet underused treatment.\"\nResearchers analyzed patterns of care and survival outcomes for 35,961 patients diagnosed with early-stage follicular lymphoma as listed in the National Cancer Data Base. The study found that the use of radiation therapy in these patients decreased from 37 percent in 1999 to 24 percent in 2012 while there were increases in the use of single-agent chemotherapy and observation without any initial treatment. Patients who received radiation therapy had five-year and 10-year survival rates of 86 percent and 68 percent, respectively; those who did not have radiation therapy had rates of 74 percent and 54 percent.\n\"Survival with radiation therapy in these cases are higher and we think that an evidence-based",

Metrolinx, the provincial agency responsible for the $456-million project, plans to line several stretches of the 25-km rail path with the barriers, in accordance with Transportation Ministry guidelines.\nUnhappy at the prospect of what Putnam calls a “huge canvas for graffiti” along the tracks, members of the Junction Triangle Rail Committee and Wabash Building Society hired award-winning landscape architects James Brown and Kim Storey to draft an alternative plan.\nWhat they came up with was a plan for “green walls” — vegetation growing inside metal caging — intermingled with 10,000 trees along the rail corridor. Seven new pedestrian bridges would connect “linear park” pathways on each side of the tracks.\nBrown and Storey presented the proposal — called “Sharing Boundaries” — to about 20 people at Toronto City Hall on Wednesday, including NDP MP Andrew Cash and York South-Weston MPP Laura Albanese.\nIf concrete barriers are deemed necessary, Brown offered, the green walls could go up beside them to hide them from view.\n“You could solve the sound issue and the esthetic issue,” he said, adding that elements of the neighbourhood proposal could be phased in, or introduced as pilot projects, to strike the right balance between noise reduction and visual",

Responding to accusations that Metrolinx has failed to adequately consult with the community, he said the agency is willing to meet “any time” to discuss neighbourhood concerns.\nPutnam and others called for a meeting with “decision makers” such as Transportation Minister Glen Murray and Metrolinx head Bruce McCuaig.",

        "prompt": "The cabinet has approved a multi-million dollar project to replace the Bambalapitiya Flats, a significant landmark in Colombo, lying on very valuable land. A plan was, floated in 2014 to redevelop the ten-acre land on which the Bambalapitiya flats now stand. UTL Global Projects registered in Singapore made the proposal. A tripartite MOU was signed between UTL Global Projects, Engineering Projects India and the National Housing Development Authority for this project. The land belongs to the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA). The project did not materialize.\nThe project was revived, when Yahapalana came in, on the recommendation of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa. The Bambalapitiya redevelopment project was ‘a novel and complex project, the likes of which had never been undertaken in this country’, he said.\nCabinet approval was obtained and NHDA wrote to Global Project Pvt and Engineering Projects India Pvt that the Cabinet had approved their joint proposal and they should incorporate a company in Sri Lanka for this project. Thereupon, a company called City Square Projects was duly incorporated in Sri Lanka. A formal agreement was entered into between the BOI and City Square Projects. Though Engineering Projects India was listed as a partner in the agreement, the agreement was signed only by the directors of City Square.\nIn March 2017, on Cabinet approval, National Housing Development Authority signed an agreement with City Square Projects, with the proviso that they had to bring USD 10 million into the country within four to six weeks of signing the agreement. Once the final project documents are signed, the land on which the Bambalapitiya flats stand will be transferred to City Square Projects on a 99-year lease.\nMinister Sajith Premadasa recommended in November 2016 that a gazette notification be issued immediately to acquire the Bambalapitiya flats site under the Condominium Management Authority law which provides for any condominium that is over 40 years old to be acquired. He further recommended that the Bambalapitiya flats be declared an ‘Urban development Site’ under Section 2 of the Urban Development Projects (Special Provisions) Act No: 2 of 1980. This provision disallows appeals to courts regarding the acquisition of property for development projects.\nC.A.Chandraprema of the Island examined the Bambalapitiya project agreement and alerted readers to its very serious implications. He pointed out that the main investor, UTL Global Projects had been incorporated in Singapore only in February 2011 and its owners are three Indian nationals, Koorapati Premalatha Rani, Meena Pooja and Prashanth Koorapati, members of one family.\nCity Square Projects is not a joint project of Global and Engineering Projects India. It is owned by Global alone. Koorapati confirmed in a letter to the Chairman of the Project Steering Committee of the Bambalapitiya flats redevelopment project”, Ministry of Housing and Construction, that City Square Projects (Pvt) Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd, through its holding company Centennial Holdings” Singapore.\nIt is to a subsidiary wholly owned by them, City Square, that the Bambalapitiya land is to be transferred. They are going to get 10 acres of the best land in Colombo on a 99-year lease without paying the government any money. The government is going to give this prime land, Bambalaptiya flats, to a company which does not have the financial clout to be able to handle a project of this nature Chandraprema again observed. As a result, three Indian nationals will hold a 99-year lease on ten acres of the best land in Colombo. emphasized Chandraprema.\nGlobal had misled the government into thinking that they had brought in a large Indian government owned construction conglomerate, Engineering Projects India Ltd as their partner to finance and build the project. BOI, the NHDA and even the tenants of the Bambalapitiya flats appear to be under the impression that Engineering Projects India Ltd has undertaken to invest 300 million USD in this project, said Chandraprema. That is not so, he said.\nEngineering Projects India Ltd, a state owned entity in India, has extensive experience in construction and real estate and solid financial backing. This company is already involved in water projects in Vavuniya and Puttalam with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. But the company is not involved in this deal.\nSince doubts had been expressed, government of Sri Lanka asked for proof that Engineering Projects was actually working with Global. They asked, is Engineering Projects India Ltd actually in a consortium with UTL Global Projects, if so where is the consortium agreement. There was no consortium agreement with Global. Instead, Koorapati sent a redacted version of the agreement between Engineering Projects India and City Square to the Project Steering Committee, claiming that the rest of it was ‘highly confidential’.\nThe version sent was a consortium agreement between City Square and Engineering Projects India Ltd had been signed on 5 March 2016.Engineering Projects India will take up equity in City Square Projects Pvt Ltd after applying for the required permission from the government of India. Till then they will continue to develop the project as a consortium.\nChandraprema pointed out that the dates on these letters show that Global wrote to Engineering Projects India Ltd making the initial proposal only on the day that they had applied to the BOI claiming that they were already in a partnership with Engineering Projects India Ltd for redeveloping the Bambalapitiya flats. He also pointed out that even if Engineering Projects India Ltd joins City Square Projects later. That too means nothing. They have only a very limited role and the three Indian nationals who own Global will still be calling all the shots.\nChandraprema observed that the document sent by Koorapati did not say anything about the financial commitment of Engineering Projects India Ltd to the project. This is a significant omission. The redacted version of the consortium agreement simply states that Engineering Projects India Ltd will ‘endeavour’ to find a third party to provide the working capital for the project. That does not indicate a financial commitment.\nThe total project is estimated to cost 500 Million USD. But, Koorapati’s letter to the Project Steering Committee clearly indicates that they do not know where the money for the project is going to come from, said Chandraprema. They have mentioned that the money will have to be raised from third parties but no such third parties have been identified .\nIf the Indian government does not give Engineering Projects permission to go ahead with the project they will drop out of it automatically. Then, three individuals, Koorapati Premalatha Rani, Meena Pooja and Prashanth Koorapati who own Global Projects and City Square will be left holding a 99-year lease on 10 acres of land in Bambalapitiya without paying a cent to the government, said Chandraprema.\nChandraprema also observed that there are certain legal implications in the agreements signed. According to the requirements of the BOI, both UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd and Engineering Projects India Ltd should have been the joint owners of City Square Projects. The BOI agreement that was signed on 22 June 2016 said that the project would be a joint venture between UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd and Engineering Projects India Ltd. The agreement between City Square Projects (Pvt) Ltd and the NHDA is also based on the premise that UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd and Engineering Projects India Ltd had jointly formed City Square (Pvt.) Ltd.\nHowever, Engineering Projects India Ltd is not in a consortium with UTL Global Projects and it is not part of City Square. This is a clear violation of BOI rules. Global’s argument that even though Engineering Projects India Ltd does not have a consortium agreement with Global, they do have an agreement with City Square, is also wrong. The consortium agreement should be between UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd and Engineering Projects India not between Engineering Projects India Ltd and City Square (Pvt.) Ltd.\nThe government has imposed the condition on City Square that within 4 to 6 weeks of signing the agreement with the NHDA, they will have to bring in USD 10 million to the country. This will not be difficult because City Square Projects (Pvt) Ltd will be able to use that very agreement to obtain money by pledging the land as collateral, said Chandraprema.\nCity Square Projects Pvt Ltd has said that they have not pledged or mortgaged the land, continued Chandraprema. They haven’t done so because the land has not been transferred to them yet. But the moment the land is transferred to them, that is exactly what is going to happen. Once the land is transferred to City Square Projects Pvt Ltd, the land may be used as collateral to raise the capital that UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd obviously lacks.\nWe have ‘incontrovertible proof’ that what Global intends doing once they get their hands on the land is to mortgage it to third parties, said Chandraprema. They will do so without paying a cent to the government of Sri Lanka. A new group will be left in possession of the Bambalapitiya land for 99 years and the residents of the present Bambalapitiya flats and the government of Sri Lanka will be left high and dry.\nThe residents of the Bambalapitiya flats have voiced their strong opposition to the project and point out that neither the government nor the developers have had transparent discussions with them on the project. Minister Champika Ranawaka had filed a Cabinet observation in 2016, stating that the financial credentials of the developers did not appear to have been checked and that a proper feasibility study of the project had not been carried out. There is still no feasibility report for the project said Chandraprema in 2017.\nEverything about these project smacks of a giant scam said Chandraprema. There is something seriously fishy in this whole business. Anyone can see from a mile away that this is not a project that is ever going to be completed. The fact that the government has not shown any interest in seeing the full agreement signed between City Square and Engineering Projects shows that powerful figures in the government are in on the deal. Such indifference on the part of the government can only be the result of massive kickbacks.\nThe government of Sri Lanka should reconsider this project. Funding for the project should be available upfront before any approvals are granted or the land handed over, said Chandraprema. All agreements entered into by the BOI and the NHDA with UTL Global Projects Pte Ltd or its wholly owned subsidiary City Square Projects (Pvt) Ltd should be suspended and reviewed because they have clearly attempted to deceive the government of Sri Lanka without disclosing material facts.\nAs this essay goes to press, a second ‘Bambalapitiya flat’ issue is taking place in Hambantota, where the Yahapalana government has announced in March 2019, the construction of a USD 4 billion oil refinery at Hambantota on 400acres of land, by Silver Park International and the Omani government. It was to be the biggest foreign investment in Sri Lanka since Independence. This would provide 565 Sri Lankans direct employment and up to 185 jobs for foreigners.\nThe original investment proposal was submitted to the BOI in November 10, 2016, as a joint venture between Silver Park International (Pvt) Ltd, Singapore, and the Ministry of Oil and Gas of the Sultanate of Oman”. A Cabinet memorandum dated February 15 2019 reaffirms that Silver Park International (Pte) Ltd of Singapore will hold 70 percent of shares while 30 percent will be owned by the Ministry of Oil and Gas of Sultanate of Oman”.\nA letter dated March 12 2019 from the BOI to Silver Park International in Singapore also refers to an undertaking from Silver Park to set up a project for 10 MMPTA Green Field oil refinery in Hambantota for export market in collaboration with the Sultanate of Oman Ministry of Oil and Gas.\nAs soon as the deal was announced by the government of Sri Lanka, Oman swiftly denied it had any part in the multibillion dollar investment. Omani Government said it had not invested any funds, nor agreed to invest any money so far on the project. That leaves Silver Park, like Global, as the star of the show. Thanks to the publicity, the identity of the investors have aroused local interest.\nSilver Park International (Pte) Ltd was incorporated on June 15, 2017, in Singapore. It was, therefore, set up several months after the first investment proposal was submitted to the BOI in Sri Lanka. The directors of Silver Park, like Global, are confined to one family. They are Jegath Rakshagan Sundeep Anand, Jagathrakshakan Sri Nisha and Jagathrakshakan Anusuya. They are the son, daughter and wife of S. Jagathrakshakan, a Tamilnadu politician based in Chennai.\nS. Jagathrakshakan has held positions as Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry. He has been embroiled in several allegations. It is widely reported that his personal wealth increased by 12 times in just two years from INR 5.9 crore in 2009 to INR 70 crore in 2011. Media reports said this was the highest percentage increase for assets among all ministers in the central Cabinet during that period. Jagathrakshakan’s name was also associated with the infamous Indian coal allocation scam too.\nThis ‘Silver Park’ family have incorporated two companies in Sri Lanka. These two companies are Silver Park International (Pvt) Ltd and Silver Park Petroleum (Pvt) Ltd. There are no Omani nationals or representatives in either company, reported Namini Wijedasa.\nSilver Park International in Sri Lanka was set up on September 10, 2018. Its directors are the same family, Jegath Rakshagan Sundeep Anand, Jagathrakshakan Sri Nisha, Jagathrakshakan Anusuya plus a fourth, Kunasingam Jasoharan of Mullaitivu.\nThe stated objectives of this company are to carry out the business of manufacturing, importing, exporting, distributorship, intending, brokering, real estates, transportation and wholesale trade; to participate in Government tenders in order to implement the same project and to carry on bulk or wholesale trading activities; to operate as an investment holding company; to act as an agent or representative to any other person or companies; and to carry out any other business whatsoever the company may decide at a directors’ meeting”.\nSilver Park Petroleum” was formed on February 21,2019, six days after Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama submitted his latest Cabinet paper on the subject. Its directors are the same family, Sundeep Anand, Sri Nisha, Kunasingham Jasoharan with a fourth, Dr T.A.G. Gunasekara. ‘Silver Park Petroleum’” was created to build a 10 MMPTA (million metric tons per annum) petroleum refinery for exports at Hambantota.\nThe foundation stone was laid for the new oil refinery on 24.3.19 at Hambantota. The Omani Oil and Gas Minister who was visiting Sri Lanka was also there. The Omani Minister had met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees earlier on. The meeting at Temple Trees was more in the nature of a courtesy call, a spokesman for the Prime Minister’s office said.. No specifics were discussed. This possible ‘scam’ has been incorrectly compared to the Volkswagen deal, it is nothing like the Volkswagen deal. It is like the Bambalapitiya deal.\nRamanathan Kannan who had failed to get a position as Magistrate was appointed a high court judge by the Yahapalana government, over the heads of all the others on the list. Three legal bodies, the Judicial Services Commission, the Judicial Service Association and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, reacted strongly to this appointment. They all said it was irregular. The senior-most judge who should have been promoted was, D. L. A. Manaf, District Judge of Vavuniya. D. L. A. Manaf was promoted to the High Court in March 2017.\nJudicial Services Commission (JSC) wrote to the President withdrawing its earlier recommendation that Ramanathan Kannan be appointed a High Court Judge. JSC said that if the BASL had made ‘no proper recommendation’ on the matter, the recommendation that the JSC had sent earlier to the President had ‘no force or avail in law’.\nArticle 111(2) (a) of the Constitution stipulates that judges of the High Court can be appointed by the president only on the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission. This retraction by the JSC therefore made Ramanathan Kannan’s appointment as High Court Judge unconstitutional, said the media, but the JSC did not expressly recommend that Kannan be removed from office.\nThe Secretary to the President wrote to the Judicial Services Commission seeking a recommendation for the removal of Kannan in terms of Article 111(2) (b) of the Constitution, which provides for the dismissal of High Court judges by the President on the recommendations of the JSC. But JSC did not make such a recommendation. JSC said it could intervene only when there is a complaint related to a disciplinary matter. Critics however, observed that once the JSC retracted their recommendation, he should have been removed by the President. However this has not happened. Kannan l continued to be a High Court Judge.\nJudicial Service Association, (JSA), which represents the district judges and magistrates of Sri Lanka, had met the Chief Justice, K Sri Pavan to discuss the Kannan matter and to inform him of the concerns of the judicial officers of the minor judiciary. JSA requested the Chief Justice and other members of the Judicial Service Commission to reconsider the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as High Court Judge. Appointing a lawyer practicing at the unofficial bar over the heads of many senior judges who had been serving for more than 16 years was a case of overlooking the rights of the entire subordinate judiciary. A thing that has not happened in recent history.\nThe JSA also requested the JSC to recommend to the President the removal of Kannan in terms of Article 111(2)(b) of the Constitution, since the said appointment was made on the misrepresentation of facts. If the need was to appoint a Tamil speaking High Court judge for the north and east, the senior most candidate would be the District Judge of Vavuniya D. L. A. Manaf. He is a highly qualified judge with LLB and LLM degrees from the University of Colombo and has served as a judge for 17 years .\nJudicial Services Association called a special General meeting to discuss the appointment and also the involvement of BASL, in view of the fact that BASL has no say in the appointment of judges. At the meeting JSA passed a unanimous resolution objecting to the Kannan appointment and declaring it to be an interference with the independence of the judiciary. They asked that the judge be removed and that he be barred from functioning as a judge until he is removed.\nThe JSA adopted five resolutions seeking the removal of Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge. The first resolution requested President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge as the appointment has no force or avail in law. Judicial Services Commission (JSC) and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) have re-affirmed that the recommendation with regard to the appointment of Kannan has no force or avail in law.\nSecond resolution requested the JSC to recommend the President to remove Kannan from the position of the High Court Judge. Third resolution requested the JSC to consider not allowing Kannan to function as High Court Judge till he is officially removed from the said position. The fourth resolution stated that the independence of the judiciary has been violated by the controversial appointment of Kannan and requested the President and the JSC to restore and uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary.\nThe last resolution requested the JSC to refrain from recommending nominations submitted to them from the unofficial bar for appointing High Court Judges directly in future. The appointment of Judges for High Court from unofficial Bar undermines the knowledge, experience and sacrifices made by the District Judges and Magistrates who work under immense pressures and difficulties for long periods of time in difficult areas during their career.\nThe Bar Association came under the spotlight over the Kannan matter. The Judicial Services Association informed the Bar Association that the Chief Justice had told them that the appointment had been made due to representations made to the President by the unofficial bar. This request had then been communicated to the Judicial Services Commission and the JSA had acceded to this request. The JSA stated that it had checked with the Bar Association and was told that neither the Bar Council nor the Executive Committee of the Sri Lanka Bar Association had anything to do with it. Some elements in the Sri Lanka Bar Association have misled the President and the Chief Justice.\nThe Bar Association was also concerned. Their reputation was at stake. BASL appointed an expert committee to look into the matter. The expert committee consisted of Upul Jaysuriya, Ikram Mohamed, Romesh de Silva, Upali Gunaratna, Nihal Jayamanne, Ajitha Athukorale, W.Dayaratna, Faiz Musthapha and K. Kanageeswaran. Thereafter BASL held a meeting to discuss the Kannan issue.\nThis committee informed the Bar Association that it was not possible to ask for Kannan’s removal as Kannan had not violated any conditions set out in Article 111 (2) of the Constitution. If the President was to remove Kannan without due cause, it would set a bad precedence. Also a disciplinary committee would need to be appointed to investigate the Judge and his actions before any recommendations for his removal are made. The BASL decided that since the BASL did not recommend the appointment, they would now not intervene to either ask for his removal or continuance.\nBASL President, U.R. de Silva, told reporters that the BASL did not approve of the appointment of Kannan to the HC and that the former BASL President Alagaratnam had recommended Kannan in his private capacity, using letterheads of the BASL and that it was wrong to have done so. According to the BASL Constitution, the President of the Association could not issue such letters without the knowledge of the Executive Committee. BASL made it clear that this recommendation was not made by the BASL. BASL has nothing to do with this. A few people from the BASL acting on their own had gone to the President and asked that this appointment be made.\nWhat really happened is this, said Chandraprema. A political party had first approached the Minister of Justice regarding the Kannan appointment but he had refused to accommodate them on the grounds that political parties have no role in the appointment of judges. Then this political party approached the Bar Association. Some members of the Bar Association had then written to the President and followed it up with a personal meeting as well. The President, BASL then wrote to the JSC saying that the Bar Association would like this person appointed to the High Court.\nPresidential Secretariat said that Geoffrey Alagaratnam had met the President twice to canvass for Kannan’s appointment, not with members of the BASL Executive Committee but with some outsiders. This was denied by Alagaratnam who told the BASL that he did not meet the President. Alagaratnam also said that despite any canvassing he (Alagaratnam) may have done to the President and to the Chief Justice on behalf of Kannan, it was up to the CJ and the JSC to exercise ‘due diligence’ before recommending Kannan to the President for appointment to the High Court.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena stated that he had not made an arbitrary decision in this regard. He stated that this appointment was made following a written request made by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL). Mahinda Rajapaksa said that in the nine years that he was President, he had appointed only one Supreme Court judge from the private bar and not a single member of the private bar had been appointed to either the Court of Appeal or the High Court by his government.\nThe Bar Association is now a highly politicized body with a UNP parliamentarian once functioning as its President, said Chandraprema. BASL President played a major role in the regime change project of 2015 and was given a top political appointment the moment the government changed. Yahapalana was ready to give further powers as a reward for the role played by many lawyers in the regime change project of January 2015. These lawyers knew exactly what power they wanted, it was the right to appoint judges. A group within the BASL, seeing that Yahapalana was under obligation to them, exerted this power straightaway. It is they who nominated Kannan, said Chandraprema. Kannan is obviously being backed by an influential lobby, said Hemantha Warnakulasuriya.\nAlagaratnam just before he stepped down from the position of President of the BASL, had written a letter to the new Chief Justice Priyasath Dep saying that the BASL has ‘every right’ to make recommendations to the President to appoint eminent members of the bar for judicial appointments and called on the President to consider the recommendations made by the BASL for appointments to the judiciary from time to time.\nUnfortunately, there was no provision in the law to enable the Bar Association to make such recommendations. Therefore, the first draft of the 19th Amendment contained a provision that the Constitutional Council would have to consult the Chief Justice and the Bar Association in making appointments to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. This was shot down by the Joint Opposition but re- appeared in the draft prepared by Constitutional reform committee , which gave the Bar Association a role in the appointment of judges to the superior courts.\n. Lawyers for Democracy” in a statement issued in 2017, justified the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge .There have been several appointments of private practitioners to the High Court from 1974 onwards, one of the recent appointments being that of Paramarajah during Chief Justice Sarath Silva’s tenure of office. One of the reasons being the lack of Tamil-speaking judges .\nIn our view, when appointing a practicing lawyer to the higher judiciary, views should be obtained only from the President of the Bar Association and not from its committees such as the Bar Council or the Executive Committee. If the whole Bar Council or the Executive Committee is involved there will be canvassing and open debate, compromising the nominee’s independence. The practice has always been for the President of the Bar Association to make such recommendations, whenever suitable candidates are proposed.”The statement was Signed Lal Wijenayaka, K.S. Ratnavale and JC Weliamuna, on behalf of Lawyers for Democracy.\nYou have to look at all this from the point of view of the members of the judicial service. Those who join the service as Magistrates serve in various difficult areas and gradually get promoted. Their ultimate aim is to reach the superior courts, after which they retire. That is their chosen career path. To deprive any one of them of a justly earned promotion by appointing an outsider is a crime, Warnakulasuriya added.\nJudicial Services Association said that Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe had told them that a political party had wanted Kannan appointed a high court judge, suspicion naturally centered on the Tamil National Alliance. TNA flatly denied responsibility, but loudly supported Kannan. TNA but strongly opposed the JSA call to remove Kannan. JSA’s demand amounted to interference in the JSC. HC judge Kannan is still in office, Sumanthiran said.\nPresident Sirisena had made the appointment following JSC recommendation in consultation with the Attorney General. “Therefore, legally, the appointment is valid, said M.A. Sumanthiran. Kannan’s appointment couldn’t be rescinded by the President. The Constitution states that once appointed a HC judge could be removed only on disciplinary grounds on the basis of an inquiry carried out by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and thereafter on a recommendation made to the President. We don’t see any reason to initiate a disciplinary inquiry in respect of the new HC judge, said Sumanthiran.\nSumanthiran said that appointments to the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal as well as High Court could be made from the judiciary, official bar and unofficial bar. He gave the example of appointment of C. G. Weeramantry from the private bar to the Supreme Court, It is conveniently forgotten that the Kannan appointment was made against the backdrop of a shortage of Tamil speaking judges. Kannan’s appointment was also supported by Tamil lawyers. There was an unusual number of lawyers from Batticaloa at the BASL meeting, ready to defend Alagaratnam, observed the media.\nIt is now admitted, said analysts, that Kannan has been appointed as a judge of the High Court by mistake. The former Chief Justice had assumed that Alagaratnam was speaking on behalf of the BASL. We now have a preposterous situation where a High Court appointment has been made without the proper procedure being followed. That High Court judge has taken oaths and is now functioning as a High Court Judge. He cannot be removed unless some wrong doing is proved on his part.\nThe Bar Association of Sri Lanka",
        "baseline": " has no constitutional, legal or moral right to make recommendations for the appointment of judges and that if the private bar is given the power to recommend the appointment of judges, that would corrupt the entire justice system with judges being dependent on the lawyers appearing before them for promotions and appointments, said analysts.\nIf the judges of this country are going to be dependent on the lawyers appearing before them for appointment and promotion, they will be compelled to give them the verdicts that they want and it will lead to unimaginable corruption in the judiciary. If a member of the private bar is to be appointed to the judiciary at all, it should never be done on the recommendation of that lawyer’s colleagues.\nIf you are a woman, mother or a daughter please write something on this.

        "prompt": "(CNN) — From boxed sandwiches and salads in plastic tubs to fine dining.\nThe world's gastronomic masters are now using airports for their new restaurant openings.\nHeston Blumenthal is the latest big name chef to open an air hub establishment.\nThe Perfectionist's Café will open at London Heathrow Airport's Terminal 2 on June 4.\nWhile Blumenthal is best known for molecular gastronomy, his new diner with a wood-fired oven makes it the first British airport kitchen with an open flame.\nFire safety and security are just two major hurdles for the potential airport restaurateur.\nGas can't be used in the kitchens in most airports, food suppliers have to go through security clearance and perhaps most daunting of all, customers sometimes have as little 15 minutes to spend on the meal.\nBlumenthal isn't the first culinary superstar to take on the challenge.\nGordon Ramsay opened Plane Food at Heathrow's Terminal 5 in 2008, Spain's Carles Gaig has a modern Catalan joint at Barcelona-El Prat and in North America, Los Angeles International and Toronto Pearson International are just two restaurants that have attracted restaurants from local celebrity cooks.\nHeston Blumenthal's airport restaurant is due to open soon at London's Heathrow.\nAir travel has roughly doubled since 2003, with the International Civil Aviation Authority reporting that airlines served 3.1 billion passengers in 2013 compared with 1.6 billion a decade ago.\nAirports are an integral part of that experience now, moving away from being mere gateways.\n\"It's what the airport environment does to you,\" says Heathrow Airport's head of food and beverage Ben Crowley.\n\"Eighty percent of our flights are long haul, which means the bulk of the passengers are on a big trip and therefore in the mood for an indulgence.\"\nAdvances in kitchen technology mean the no-gas policy is not the obstacle it once was.\n\"Electric heat is far better than what it used to be 10 years ago,\" says Sophie Michell, executive chef of London's Pont St restaurant and one of the four British celebrity chefs who have collaborated to open The Gorgeous Kitchen, an upmarket restaurant at Heathrow's Terminal 2.\n\"You just have to think about different ways to add flavor and cook quickly. For example, you can get good caramelization with a heavy-bottomed saucepan on induction hobs, which now have quick reactions and reach high temperatures.\"\nA greater range of food suppliers are now authorized by airports, too.\n\"We're able to use ingredients from artisanal suppliers -- previously only the big suppliers were able to get through,\" Michell says.\nStill, there are additional expenses -- airport restaurants pay higher staff wages to persuade employees away from central locales.\nNot a bad way to spend a delay.\nThey also tend to serve smaller parties than city restaurants and diners typically spend less.\n\"Though individual table checks are lower than on the high street, an airport restaurant gets much more exposure, with millions of people passing by every year,\" says Sebastian Rotteveel, creator of The Gorgeous Kitchen concept and senior director of marketing at hospitality company HMSHost International.\nTake Gordon Ramsay's Plane Food.\nAround 20,000 diners are served every month.\nThe restaurant receives hundreds of visitors a day, serving dishes such as braised pork belly and cod ceviche.\n\"Travelers have become a lot more demanding,\" Heathrow's Crowley says. \"They eat out more and expect more when they come through the airport.\"\nThese days, the greatest limitation of the airport restaurant is security, says Anthony Russell, restaurant manager at Ramsay's Plane Food.\nKitchen knives need to be kept under strict eye, and suppliers and staff must pass through security clearance.\n\"Produce delivery becomes a challenge,\" Russell says.\n\"You have to be organized and resourceful, but there is [still] no calling a supplier for an emergency delivery if you run out after lunch.\"\nOf course, quality airport dining isn't the exclusive domain of celebrity chefs.\nAt Munich Airport, voted the world's best airport for dining in the 2013 Skytrax Awards, travelers can find Europe's only airport brewery, Airbräu.\nAirbräu is a success because, like Hung's Delicacies in Hong Kong International Airport (voted second in the Skytrax awards), it's an authentic piece of its home culture, giving travelers a unique sense of place in the airport land-between-lands.\n\"A Bavarian restaurant serving local beer from its own brewery differentiates Munich Airport from other European airports,\" says Gerhard Halamoda, head of Munich Airport's hospitality operator Allresto.\nMore customers to come by June 2014.\n\"Twenty years ago, customers would use an airport once or twice a year, and restaurateurs could get away with an expensive, mediocre experience.\n\"Now, people fly frequently and if they have a good time at our airport, next time they're more likely to transfer through Munich rather than, say, Amsterdam or Frankfurt.\"\nThe hook: Europe's only airport restaurant to boast its own on-site brewery.\nThe cuisine: The beer garden is attached to a Bavarian restaurant that serves roast duck, pig knuckle and cold cured meats.\nThe beer is brewed in accordance with the Purity Decree of 1513, using local hops from the Hallertau region.\nThe bar organizes brewery tours.\nThe hook: Created by chefs Gilles Dupont and Thomas Byrne, whose joint restaurants include the Michelin-starred Dupont & Byrne.\nThe cuisine: Classic French food in an elegant space with a glass wall onto the runway.

        "prompt": "Between the years of 1647 and 1652, Gian Lorenzo Bernini produced what is considered his greatest sculpture: “Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.” One of the greatest artists living at the time, Bernini found his reputation tarnished after a mishap during the construction of the basilica of St. Peter’s Cathedral. It was later proven that he wasn’t at fault.\nIn this vision, Saint Teresa tells of an angel who pierces her heart with a spear. The wound from this spear causes her to feel the ecstasy of God’s love and the pain from its absence.\nBernini expertly uses marble to depict this vision. Rays of gold shine from above to illuminate the scene. The angel, depicted as serene and peaceful, is lifted by the softness of clouds and gently holds a long, golden spear in his right hand between his thumb and finger. The spear is aimed at Saint Teresa’s heart. She is presented in a state of ecstasy: Her eyes are closed, her head is drawn back, and her lips are parted.\nIt is safe to assume that Bernini chose to depict this event after it had begun, since she describes the angel as plunging her with the spear “several times.” But what does this all mean?\nThe contemporary understanding is to associate Teresa’s visions and Bernini’s depiction with eroticism. In the early 20th century, the founder of psychoanalytic theory, Sigmund Freud, popularized the theory that unconscious sexual impulses are behind the decisions we make and the experiences we have. Has a Freudian interpretation been projected onto Saint Teresa’s spiritual experiences and on this sculpture?\nIt is common across all religions and spiritual disciplines for practitioners to have mystical experiences after the sincere effort put into their spiritual exercises. The Buddha and Jesus, for example, engaged in spiritual exercises that resulted in mystical experiences, that is, experiencing nirvana, heaven, and",
        "baseline": " God. In modern times, adherents of qigong disciplines such as Falun Gong also speak of mystical experiences. The type of psychological interpretation popularized by Freud serves only to limit the spiritual potential of aspiring saints.\nInstead, and even in opposition to this idea, Saint Teresa’s experience may be interpreted as the ecstasy that occurs when the mind, no longer attached to bodily urges, transcends the mundane and moves toward the sublime. Visions and ecstasy are a result of the spiritual discipline initiated during her life as a Carmelite nun. She elevated her heart and mind through the diligence of her spiritual discipline to be worthy of being touched by God.\nA Freudian interpretation seems to belittle the power of Teresa’s transcendent mystical experience to nothing more than the ripple effect of bodily urges.\nThe visions and ecstasy of Saint Teresa were the result of a real, sincere spiritual effort and can serve as an inspiration for raising our own spirits toward what is higher and unknown.",

They line both sides of the long main hall, and fill up the branching halls and offices. Posters, paintings, quilts, and flags cover the walls. There are banners from students at Columbine and Virginia Tech; there are letters from school kids across America and from people as far away as France and Australia. And there are boxes of Kleenex on every table for those who read them.\nWe are overwhelmed. Residents like me, who were lucky enough to have our children come home that night; town leaders struggling to support the community and deal with the deluge of letters, toys, school supplies, and other donations sent to Newtown; and the volunteers who have been opening and sorting it all.\nThe spontaneous outdoor memorials that sprang up in Newtown after the shootings—the angels, teddy bears, Christmas trees, and other displays—became one of the symbols of this tragedy. But the many letters and cards and drawings that were mailed are less well known.\nIn their shock and grief, people were compelled to make these intensely raw, personal expressions, and send them to a town they probably hadn’t heard of before, not knowing if they would",

Others have been moved to do the same.\nThe town very respectfully cleared away most of the outdoor public memorials after a couple of weeks for incineration, the ash to be incorporated into a future permanent memorial site. When it announced that it would be doing the same with the cards and letters, we knew we had to try to save them. The town is emotionally overtaxed and lacks the funds and space to preserve them.

        "prompt": "A federal judge has denied a proposed settlement of more than $12 million in a class-action suit against the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company Lyft. US District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled today that the agreement, which would have extended additional benefits to drivers as well as monetary compensation, shortchanged Lyft drivers by as much as half of what they deserve.\nThe settlement agreement “does not fall within the range of reasonableness,” Chhabria wrote. The judge asked the attorneys of both parties to come to a new agreement by May.\nIt’s worth noting that the denial of preliminary approval relates to the financial settlement proposed by the parties, not the misclassification of workers alleged in the suit. The suit, filed by Lyft drivers in California in 2013, claimed that drivers should be classified as official employees of the company, and as such are entitled to reimbursements, including mileage expenses.\nLabor rights groups say that the judge’s refusal to approve the settlement speaks to a gross undervaluing of all of the drivers’ claims—including its worker misclassification claim. The Teamsters, along with other Lyft drivers, previously filed objections to the settlement and more recently filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit.\n“We are pleased with today’s ruling,” says Rome Aloise, Teamsters International Vice President.\nLyft’s biggest rival, the global ride-hailing giant Uber, is facing a worker misclassification suit of its own, also filed by California drivers. The trial date in that case is set for late June.\nLyft has agreed to pay more than $12 million in a proposed class-action lawsuit seeking to classify drivers as employees in California. In a settlement agreement reached late Tuesday, the ride-hailing service would extend additional benefits to drivers and pay them to resolve the dispute but not make them official employees.\nShannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston attorney who represented Lyft drivers in the case and negotiated the settlement, said the agreement also includes critical changes to how Lyft will conduct its business, leading to better benefits for workers.\n“We believe this is a fair settlement and adequate resolution of the claims we brought, given the risks we faced in the litigation against Lyft,” Liss-Riordan said.\nDrivers at risk of deactivation will be given clear notice and an opportunity to present their side.\nPreviously, Lyft’s terms of service stated that the company could deactivate a driver for any reason; now, the ride-hailing company will only be able to do so for one of a list of predetermined reasons, such as a low passenger rating, according to the settlement agreement. Drivers at risk of deactivation, meanwhile, will be given clear notice and an opportunity to present their side. If a driver is deactivated but would like to contest the decision, he or she he can challenge the ruling in arbitration, at Lyft’s expense. Drivers will also be able to address pay-related issues in arbitration.\nThe settlement also includes a provision for a “favorite driver” feature, where Lyft drivers who are identified as favorites by their passengers “will receive added benefits,” according to Liss-Riordan.\n“We are pleased to have resolved this matter on terms that preserve the flexibility of drivers to control when, where and for how long they drive on the platform and enable consumers to continue benefitting from safe, affordable transportation,” Kristin Sverchek, general counsel at Lyft, said in a statement.\nThe $12.25 million in damages will be paid out in proportion to the amount drivers have driven for Lyft in California, Liss-Riordan says. Based on the data Liss-Riordan’s team has reviewed, the majority of the more than 100,000 drivers who have driven for Lyft have logged less than a total of 50 hours with Lyft.\nLiss-Riordan noted that Lyft successfully enforced an arbitration clause in its driver contracts that contains a ban on class actions, which contributed to the decision to seek a settlement rather than pursue the suit further. A federal judge must still approve the settlement.\nMeanwhile, Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing service, has not been able to enforce a similar clause and will go to trial on June 20 to fight a similar class-action suit brought by California drivers, also represented by Liss-Riordan, seeking to be recognized as employees of the company.\nLiss-Riordan says it was her team’s preference to seek greater compensation for the drivers she represents in the suit against Uber.\n“In the litigation we are pursuing against Uber, we hear daily complaints from drivers about how they feel Uber has mistreated them … cutting fares without their input, shortchanging them on pay they are owed, and deactivating them for no reason or no legitimate reason,” she says.\nUber declined to respond to Liss-Riordan’s comments. In an Uber-commissioned survey released last month, a majority of Uber drivers reported that they worked multiple jobs and liked the platform’s scheduling flexibility, a key element of Uber’s argument that drivers themselves are not looking to become official employees.\nYou Can Get Justin Bieber’s New Album by Hailing a Lyft. Wait, What?\nLyft, naturally, wants more riders in order to compete with Uber. For some reason, the ride-sharing company thinks the ticket to those new users is Justin Bieber. And so, from November 12 to November 19, Lyft users will be able to buy Bieber’s new album, Purpose, for just $5. The catch is, before they can buy the album, users have to “slide into Bieber Mode” (yep!) and take a $5 Lyft ride, after which, they’ll get a download link and a $5 credit for their next ride.\nWhich sounds like a lot of work? The alternative for eager Beliebers is to, you know, just wait until Purpose probably comes out on Spotify and stream it from the comfort of an Uber.\nAs marketing stunts go, Bieber Mode is an especially strange one. It depends on a niche user base of diehard Justin Bieber fans, who a) need rides b) are super impatient and c) are at least 18 years old, meaning they’re allowed to book a Lyft ride solo in the first place. (Sorry, teeny-boppers.) At best, Bieber Mode merits consideration as a glimpse into an alternate future in which Lyft became not just a ride-sharing company but a marketing channel for all manner of digital product releases. The Purpose release could be the first test of that model. Even then, though, it’s hard to remember a marketing channel that was this convoluted.\nIt will be a while before we see whether this gimmick pays off for Lyft—and we’re not entirely confident it will. In the meantime, here’s a promo video of Bieber surprising unsuspecting passengers in Lyft cars recently. Whether this entices or terrifies you will tell you pretty quickly whether sliding into Bieber Mode is right for you.\nLyft",

Now the company wants to make itself out to be friendlier to its drivers, too.\nA tiered deal with Shell that gives drivers discounts on gas the more rides they gave to customers.\nLyft is doing everything it can think of to strengthen its position against its archrival, Uber, a global giant now valued at $51 billion, which also offers its drivers a range of perks. To gain global traction, Lyft recently agreed to partner with with China’s biggest ride-hailing firm, Didi Kuaidi. It’s also joined with insurance company Allstate to provide driver roadside assistance and Starbucks to give drivers a faster route to Gold membership—this includes coffee discounts (and a place to use the bathroom).\nThe latest features for drivers are rolling out in phases, Lyft says.

With countries meeting in Paris to discuss combating IS, can its advance be halted?\nWorld leaders from 20 countries meet in Paris today to assess efforts to defeat Islamic State (Isis), the terrorist group which has seized vast swathes of territory across the Middle East in the last year.\nThe meeting comes at a time of heighted urgency over what to do next following the militant group’s two swift victories in recent weeks. Late last month Isis seized control of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, a mere 60 miles west of Baghdad, while in Syria the group took control of Palmyra, the ancient city which is home to some the earth’s oldest artefacts.\nThe capture of Ramadi meant the militants also seized the al-Waleed border crossing, the last remaining bridge between Iraq and Syria that they did not already hold. This effectively now means Syria no longer has any common border with Iraq, and with similar losses to al-Qaeda further south, neither has much of a border with Jordan either.\nFor a military group intent on creating a so-called caliphate in the heart of the Middle East, this is an undisputable step closer to a final realisation of that ambition.\nConquering both Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria also makes the once unforeseeable prospect of Isis moving simultaneously into both countries’ respective capitals, Baghdad and Damascus feasible, at least on paper. This, just a few months ago, was a scenario that was considered strategically impossible.\nMeanwhile in Libya, a separate branch of the militant group that controls the Libyan coastal city of Sirte has expanded its territory and pushed back militia from the neighbouring city of Misrata. The continued expansion of the group inside Libya has alarmed western officials because of its proximity to Europe.\nLittle wonder that Washington faces calls that the US is losing control of events in the region.\nAnalysts suggest Isis now practically holds half of Syria, with much of the rest held by Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian affiliate of al-Qaeda that has fought the Kurds in the past. The group also continues to seize vital oil regions, and has solidified its control over the strategic cities of Mosul and Raqqa – the Syrian town that has become the militant group’s de facto capital.\nThis latest surge of momentum is all the more remarkable given the group’s failure to conquer the Syrian border city of Kobani after a totemic four-month battle earlier this year. So what has changed? Firstly, the local forces on the ground appear incapable of defending territory. The fearsome reputation that Isis has instilled in its opponents means that the group is met with less resistance than ever before.\nSecondly, the lack of coalition air cover has buoyed Isis fighters, while internal differences over the common enemy among Syrian forces means the armies lack clear purpose.\nDr Afzal Ashraf a consultant fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) told Channel 4 News: “In Iraq you’re seeing a clear lack of leadership and control as well as",
        "baseline": " the consequences of gaps in coalition air-cover due to weather effects.\nDr Ashraf says that the failures are no surprise. “The coalition has failed to abide by a couple of fundament principles of military strategy. One is singularity of command. In Iraq there is no singularity of command and it seems what coordination that exists between Iraqi forces and the coalition is utterly inadequate.\nGenocide, cultural cleansing and an endgame that could even see two countries eventually fall into the hands of Isis. Today’s talks in Paris are unlikely to glean quick answers. But the urgency to act has never been more pressing.\nAs the West assesses its few available options, expect clichéd calls for “boots on the ground” to resurface from some who will argue a more direct military strategy is the only way of stemming the advance. This time, unlike last year, its dismissal as an option may not be so immediate. Especially if the situation becomes even more serious.",

Padres batters were swinging at everything, not showing any plan at the plate. It was set up for Santana to have a good day. And he did. He got ahead of hitters, and it was over after that as he tossed his career high fifth complete game. He struck out a season high nine batters along the way.

        "prompt": "By any standards, the restructuring of Hearts - from a business and football perspective - appears to have been a success.\nWhile Ann Budge has overhauled the way in which the club is run, Craig Levein has revamped the football set-up, with Hearts' healthy lead at the top of the Championship the most obvious gauge of success on that front.\nThis has been achieved with the minimum of fuss, with Levein staying out of the spotlight and the man he appointed as head coach - Robbie Neilson - dampening any hint of hyperbole surrounding their title challenge.\nIt's a mindset he has urged his players to adopt too and so when Genero Zeefuik - just in the door - handed journalists a headline on a plate this week, Neilson would have been pulling his ample mane out.\nThe Dutchman's claim that victory over Rangers would mean the league title was in the bag will not be repeated on Neilson's watch.\nHis own appointment was one of a number of difficult and controversial decisions taken in May by Levein, who discarded the popular Gary Locke and several experienced players who'd taken wage cuts to help Hearts through administration.\nThere was a furore at the time, but eight months down the line, Hearts are in rude health, it seems, though still Neilson won't be coaxed into accepting publicly that Levein has been vindicated.\n\"I'll tell you at the end of the season, if we go up. That was the ultimate aim - to get promoted,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly in a good position at the moment. If we get up, it was a good decision.\n\"I feel it's going ok so far, there's still an awful lot of room for improvement, a lot of hard work to get done. I think we're on the right track.\"\nThat's as close to getting carried away as the understated, quietly spoken Neilson gets.\nThe work ethic is a key principle at Hearts, with Neilson having implemented a training schedule that incorporates two and sometimes three sessions a day.\nPlayers have responded well, with Morgaro Gomis the latest to admit he's fitter than he's ever been as a result of the new regime.\nThat is a Neilson initiative, but Levein oversees everything, from the football academy upwards.\n\"He's set a process with guys who want to work hard, do well and want to progress the club. His influence is all over the club,\" added Neilson.\n\"That ethos he brought in, he started to do it at Dundee United before he took the Scotland job. I think it's something he's been planning a long time and he's definitely implemented it well.\"\nLevein's reputation took a battering as the Scotland manager, but his work at Hearts has begun to repair that.\nHis willingness to allow Neilson free rein over first-team matters has also won over some of the doubters.\n\"He's going about his job quite meticulously, but behind the scenes, with Robbie being allowed to get on with his job. I was sceptical about it to begin with, I didn't really see how it would work, how it would merge, but it's worked very well,\" former Hearts captain Michael",

        "prompt": "BEIRUT (AP) — He may have fallen from grace internationally as one of the auto industry’s most powerful leaders, but Carlos Ghosn can count on continued support in at least one corner of the globe.\nLebanon has long held hopes that Ghosn, whose grandparents were Lebanese and who holds extensive development projects in the country, would play a bigger role in politics one day, or help rescue its increasingly sluggish economy.\nBut Ghosn, ex-chairman of Nissan Motor Co., was detained last month on allegations of underreporting his income, and on Friday, a Japanese court approved extending his detention for 10 more days.\nNow, politicians across the board are mobilizing in his defense, with some suggesting his detention may be part of a political or business-motivated conspiracy, and the government even considering extraditing him from Tokyo to face trial here.\n“To Carlos Ghosn in his predicament I say, a Lebanese phoenix will not be scorched by the Japanese sun,” Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said at a security conference in Beirut this week.\nLebanon, a tiny country of 4.5 million, takes excessive pride in its huge emigrant community and successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage. They include Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim, Columbian singer Shakira, Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, Lebanese-British barrister Amal Clooney and fashion designers Elie Saab and Reem Accra.\nThe Lebanese took special pride in the auto industry icon, who holds a Lebanese passport, speaks fluent Arabic and visits regularly, including a last visit right before he was detained in Tokyo. Born in Brazil, where his Lebanese grandfather had sought his fortune, Ghosn grew up in Beirut, where he spent part of his childhood at a Jesuit school.\nAs he began his ascent in the auto industry, first with Renault and then by bringing Nissan in Tokyo back from the brink of bankruptcy, Ghosn kept in touch with old friends. He married twice, first to a Lebanese woman who resides in Beirut and again in 2016 to Carole Nahas, also of Lebanese heritage.\nAs a Maronite Christian, Ghosn’s name occasionally popped up as a possible candidate for the presidency, but he repeatedly dismissed suggestions he would run for office, saying he is not a politician. The post of president is reserved for a Christian in Lebanon’s sectarian-based system of government.\nAlthough the extent of his businesses in Lebanon is not known exactly, Ghosn has spoken in interviews about various real estate projects in the country and sits on the board of several universities, hospitals and charities. In 2012, he became a partner in the Lebanese winery IXSIR, and is a board member of family-owned Saradar Bank.\nIn 2017, the government honored him with a special postage stamp — a show of respect to a man considered a model of Lebanese entrepreneurial spirit.\nSo when news broke on Nov. 19 that Ghosn, 64, had been detained on allegations he underreported millions of dollars in income, and that Nissan is accusing him of using company money for personal gain, people in Lebanon were stunned — and many were unconvinced.\nLebanese Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil promptly issued a statement saying Lebanon would stand by Ghosn, adding he had asked the Lebanese ambassador to Tokyo to look out for “the model of Lebanese success abroad.” The ambassador has since reportedly met three times with Ghosn — who is being held in a small cell in the Japanese capital — providing him with a mattress and food in the form of salmon, according to one report on a local TV channel.\nGhosn’s dramatic downfall has sparked various conspiracy theories, with some claiming that his arrest was a U.S. ploy to punish him for resisting sanctions on Iran and others speculating it was an internal coup engineered by Nissan executives.\nAllegations against Ghosn reported in the Japanese media, but unconfirmed, suggest he spent Nissan funds on fancy homes in Paris, Beirut, Rio de Janeiro and Amsterdam, and on family vacations and other personal expenses. Ghosn has denied the allegations against him, saying he had no intention of underreporting his income, the reports say.\nGhosn’s three-story property in one of Beirut’s most prized real estate districts stands out for its pink walls and blue shuttered windows. The traditional old Lebanese house was acquired and renovated in 2014, according to neighbors who said they occasionally saw him visiting.\n“He is a successful businessman with a good reputation … he is not someone you would expect to be a cheat,” said Rouba Rabah, who owns an art gallery opposite Ghosn’s property.\nAnother neighbor who declined to give his name said he was stunned by the news like every other Lebanese would be, recalling how he would see Ghosn personally overseeing the renovation work four years ago.\nLebanese businessmen, many of them personal friends of Ghosn, have rallied around him, even after he was stripped of his title as chairman at Nissan and at Japanese partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\nA group of Lebanese lawyers is now considering forming a team for his defense, and Justice Minister Salim Jreissati told",
        "baseline": " Lebanon’s daily An-Nahar that the government is considering asking Japan to extradite Ghosn to face trial on Lebanese soil.\nLawyer Amal Haddad told The Associated Press that she and the current head of the Lebanese Lawyers’ Syndicate, Andree Chidiac, were considering the options. “That’s all I can say until we are formally assigned the case,” Haddad said.\nIn Ghosn’s downfall, many here see a lost opportunity.

Their research suggests the future of treating and preventing obesity may include targeting the brain, not just the stomach.\nIf you’re worried about gaining weight, exercise may help – and not just by burning calories. Exercise may strengthen your brain’s ability to resist high-calorie foods such as potato chips and chocolate bars in favour of more healthful options.\nIt’s an idea being explored by Dr. Cassandra Lowe, a postdoctoral fellow of the University of Western Ontario’s BrainSCAN program: How to tackle obesity by improving the brain’s dietary decision-making.\nIn a recent review article, published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Lowe and her colleagues examined the relationship between obesity and the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in planning and inhibitory control. That relationship, they reported, appears to be reciprocal; people who have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex are more likely to overeat highly processed, calorie-dense foods. In turn, overeating these foods changes their brains to increase the likelihood of overeating.\nTo disrupt this cycle, she is among a number of scientists who are looking at ways to boost activity in the prefrontal cortex to regulate food consumption, from exercise to brain-training activities to brain stimulation. Their research suggests the future of treating and preventing obesity may include targeting the brain, not just the stomach.\n“It’s really important that we … consider the prefrontal cortex when we’re thinking of preventative measures because there are lots of ways that we can kind of improve our executive functions,” Lowe says, adding exercise appears to be one of the best.\nNot only do people who engage in regular exercise tend to have better executive functioning, she says, exercise has been shown to change the structure and function of brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, and the prefrontal cortex.\nNow, Lowe intends to study whether exercise can increase brain activity in adolescents as an early preventative measure against obesity.\nAt the Oregon Research Institute, a charitable research centre that focuses on healthy behaviour change, scientist Dr. Sonja Yokum has been testing whether brain-training tasks can help treat obesity.\nIn a pilot study involving 47 overweight and obese adults, published in 2017 in the journal Behaviour Research and Therapy, Yokum and her team found those who received special training aimed at changing their reaction to high-calorie foods lost more body fat over a four-week period, compared with the control group. In brain scans, those who received the special training also showed reductions in the reward and attention regions of their brains in response to images of high-calorie foods.\nTheir training involved a series of computer tasks, aimed at inhibiting their response to high-calorie foods and directing their attention to low-calorie foods. In one task, participants practised picking out an image of low-calorie foods, such as a carrot and cucumber slices, as quickly as possible from among several images of high-calorie foods, such as cakes, burgers and cookies. Another exercise asked them to quickly push a button whenever images framed by a dark blue border, which were always of low-calorie foods, flashed up on screen, but to refrain from responding whenever images framed by a light grey border, which were always of high-calorie foods, appeared.\nWhile the research team noted several limitations to their study, including its small sample size, they suggested this type of computer training has some advantages over standard weight-loss interventions. Not only is it cost-effective, they wrote, it aims to directly change some of the automatic thoughts that lead to overeating.\nAt the University of Waterloo, however, Dr. Peter Hall says he is skeptical brain-training exercises can effectively change what and how much people eat. While people may get better at performing the tasks on which they’re trained, these improvements do not tend to carry over to everyday life, says Hall, a professor in the school of public health and health systems and a co-author of the Trends in Cognitive Sciences paper with Lowe.\nThere is, however, good evidence to suggest brain stimulation, which involves the use of magnetic or electric currents to influence brain activity, can regulate food cravings and change food consumption, he says. But, he adds, the application of brain stimulation as a potential treatment would likely only be reserved for extreme cases, such as when a",
        "baseline": " patient is morbidly obese and faces life-threatening conditions related to obesity.\n“Under conditions where someone might seek bariatric surgery, for example, it might one day become a viable alternative, or something that’s used with bariatric surgery to prevent the regain of weight,” he says.\nIn the meantime, what scientists are now learning about the brain’s role in obesity provides reinforcement for existing public health recommendations around obesity prevention, Hall says. For instance, it provides greater justification for increasing the availability of healthier food options and decreasing the availability of less healthy ones to make it less taxing on the brain’s self-regulatory networks, he says. It also emphasizes the need to pay attention to people’s total lifestyles, since exercise, sleep, and stress exposure all have implications for brain health.\n“To the extent that brain health is optimized, people are going to be able to live healthier lives in general,” Hall says.",

Microsoft greeted 700 advertisers and agency executives assembled on its sprawling campus here last week with a simple message: The software giant is dead serious about advertising.\nHow serious? Enough to double its R&D budget for its online business to $1 billion in the next fiscal year, setting up the possibility of an arm’s race with archrival Google that should spur more sophisticated ad options. And serious enough for both chairman Bill Gates and CEO Steve Ballmer to predict advertising would act as a major growth driver across its $40 billion-plus business.\nMicrosoft last week officially rolled out for U.S. advertisers the centerpiece of its strategy, Microsoft adCenter, a potentially wide-ranging platform that would allow advertisers to place demographically and behaviorally targeted ads everywhere from Web pages to search results to Internet-connected TV to video games to cell phones.\nUnlike Google’s AdWords and Yahoo!’s search platform, adCenter gives advertisers audience intelligence data, which allows them to target ads to customer segments. While adCenter is now only serving text ads on search results pages, Microsoft envisions it stretching across several forms of digital media.\nMicrosoft’s outsized ambitions are in stark contrast to its current position in the Web ad market. Its ad growth significantly trails both Google and Yahoo!. In the most recent quarter, Microsoft’s ad revenue grew 7 percent against 80 percent for Google and 38 percent for Yahoo!. Analysts have doubted the company’s ability to make much headway in the near term.\nYet the overall shift to digital media, whether it’s the Web, Internet protocol TV or wireless, presents Microsoft with a longer-term opportunity to take part in a much larger market than advertising on Web pages, said company executives. Joanne Bradford, corporate vp of global sales and marketing at Microsoft, spoke not of the current $13 billion Internet ad market but of a $100 billion market opportunity in 10 years’ time.\nBill Gates, speaking at the conference during an interview that will be used for an episode of The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch, vowed Microsoft would catch up to and surpass Google and Yahoo!. He dismissed the idea that Microsoft was too late to the ad market, noting that until recently, nearly all media was offline. Now Microsoft is investing heavily to advance. “This is a rare case where we’re being underestimated,” Gates said.\nWhile focus is often placed on Microsoft’s uphill battle to unseat Google as the top search engine, Bradford sees its advertising strengths coming from its traditional role as a software platform. As a sign of a companywide mandate, last week it quietly replaced “MSN” with “Microsoft” in front of adCenter’s name.\nAs a platform provider for video games (Xbox), productivity software (Office), portals (MSN) and cell phones (Windows Mobile), Microsoft is banking on acting as a digital media platform that enables advertisers to reach audiences wherever they are throughout the day—at work, home or on the go. In a nod to this multiplatform view, Microsoft said last week it agreed to buy Massive, an in-game video advertising firm.\n“Microsoft’s in a position where they can accelerate the development of the digital world from a single device to multiple devices,” said Jeff Lanctot, general manager of aQuantive’s Avenue A/Razorfish.\nBut Microsoft is not alone in its ambitious ad platform plans. Google is expanding AdWords to include print ads, and it plans to add radio advertising following its dMarc acquisition. Google executives have expressed interest in including TV. Similarly, Yahoo! this week will release an updated version of its search platform, which it said could eventually handle ads on TVs and cell phones.\nWhile adCenter is engineered to handle many forms of media, its release is keyed on the Internet search market, where Microsoft has struggled against Google.

It was only the second go-round, but she also just about ended the match.\nPeninsula was on its way to a surprisingly lopsided 13-5 upset of visiting Corona del Mar in the nonleague girls' tennis match. Kemp ended the suspense, putting her team up 9-3 headed into the final round.\nThe way it was going, it was unlikely the Sea Kings could sweep the final round and send it to games. They would have been happy just to win a doubles set.\nFor the first time in Coach Brian Ricker's seven-year tenure, CdM was swept in doubles.\nRicker has been trying to figure out his team's doubles situation. In three of their six matches, the Sea Kings have lost a majority of the doubles sets.\nHe said last week he inserted two new doubles teams in the starting lineup, with seniors Morgan McVey and Erica Lewis, as well as juniors Caroline Larsen and Ariana Naaseh.\n\"We changed the strategy,\" Ricker said. \"Really, we went back to what we've always done, which is high, heavy topspin. I put in girls who play that way. I felt like even though we lost every set [Tuesday], they got better in every set they played. I think they'll keep improving … That's four girls who haven't started before.\"\nSenior Mackenzie Ludlow and sophomore Alison Ishii had the best chance of avoiding the doubles sweep for CdM (4-2), ranked No. 3 in the CIF Southern Section Division I coaches' poll. The Sea Kings' No. 1 team had a 6-5 lead on the Kemp sisters in the third go-round, but lost in a tiebreaker.\nThe Peninsula No. 1 doubles team of Victoria Tam and Brandea Bunnag, as well as the No. 2 team of Lauren Gutierrez and Sachi Carlson, also swept.\n\"We had some good sets,\" said Ishii, whose usual partner, freshman Lauren Thaxter, was out sick. \"When it comes down to it, they're just good. There's nothing I can really say. They played their best really … We've got to stick together and keep fighting.\"\nSenior Lynda Xepoleas easily won three sets at No. 1 singles for CdM, 6-1, 6-0, 6-0. Sophomore Nini Ugrelidze also won a pair of sets and senior Kalika Slevcove battled.\nSlevcove, herself fighting sickness, was in the longest set of the first round but fell to Peninsula freshman Jasmine Hosseini, 7-5. That gave Peninsula (5-1) a 4-2 lead after round one.\nHosseini also beat Ugrelidze with her steady style.\n\"You had to be able to come in and take some balls out of the air, put some short balls away, which Lynda could do,\" Ricker said. \"The other girls couldn't come in and take those balls out of the air. [Hosseini] was good. You want to think she's not good because of the way she plays, [but she's] a quality 'pusher.' She's good at it.\"\nPeninsula co-coach Tom Cox could see his team rise from its No. 5 ranking in Division I. Cox talked about",
        "baseline": " how last year when these teams played, CdM had clinched the match with a 10-2 lead.\n\"A little turnaround from last year,\" Cox said. \"We've got three new freshmen in, a transfer student [Tam] and everybody improved a little bit … [sweeping doubles against CdM] was quite a feat for us.\"\nIt's still early in the season, but it doesn't get easier for CdM. The Sea Kings have two more big matches in the coming weeks, facing Dana Hills on Oct. 6 and Pacific Coast League rival University on Oct. 12. The Dolphins and Trojans are ranked Nos. 2 and 4, respectively, in Division I.\nSix of the nine doubles sets Tuesday were 6-3 or closer, giving a bit of room for optimism.\n\"Even though we took a beating today, I feel like our doubles are going to get better,\" Ricker said. \"We've got a whole season.\"",

And so he’s basically — and a mentor to Donald Trump, it should be said, later in life.\nAnd so he thinks government is sort of a family mafia business, and he can shut it down, and loyalty to the Don is the primary value here.\nBROOKS: The relationship between presidents and attorney generals have generally been fraught, because they have this weird role of being appointed, but semi-independent representing their agency. And so it’s a history of fraughtness.\nTrump doesn’t seem to understand that. He doesn’t understand the history. To me, it’s a mistake, though, to think, because he’s covering up, there was an underlining crime vis-a-vis Russia. That’s imposing a linearity on Donald Trump’s mind that doesn’t always exist.\nAnd he could just not be — he just could be upset that they’re sort of diminishing his victory.

Here are some pros and cons to help you get started.\nJust as Google Play Music is available on iOS, Android users can take advantage of Apple Music. It will be available in the fall, but is limited in scope (see Cons).\nIf you're a musician looking to get noticed, Apple will accept submissions for inclusion on Apple Music. No word yet on how strict it will be, but if its App Store guidelines are any indication, you're going to have to submit more than a kazoo solo from your dorm room. 9to5Mac has a rundown on how to get started.\nA three-month free trial will give you plenty of time to decide whether or not you like Apple Music and to see how it compares to other services.\nApple Music gives you access to 30 million songs, but that's the same number as Spotify. It's not exactly the entire iTunes catalog; don't expect to stream The Beatles, for example.\nUnlike Spotify, Apple Music does not have a free, ad-supported option.

It's meant to let artists share with fans, but they can really already do that on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and a host of other services.\nYou'll be able to access Apple Music on iOS, Apple Watch, Macs, PCs, and Android devices.

        "baseline": " were told it was disrespectful and inauspicious to do so. Instead, a woman would address her husband as the father of their child, by his profession, or simply with \"please listen.\"\nIn discussions held afterward, women practiced saying their husbands' names aloud for the first time, said Stalin, who goes by his first name.\nThe women were then encouraged to talk to their husbands about the practice.\nIn many cases, the men did not allow their wives to address them by name, and one woman was ostracized by her village for referring to an older male relative by name, Stalin said.\nBut some women were told they could call their husbands by name — in private.\n\"That is still a step forward,\" Stalin said.\n\"Our experience with this campaign is that these women are not passively accepting of patriarchy. They are very aware and just waiting for an opportunity to push back — in a thoughtful and considered manner, which perhaps has a greater impact.\"",

        "prompt": "Milestone birthdays often serve as a reminder of the persistent passage of time. Whether it’s turning 30, 40, 50, 60 or beyond, reaching each decade threshold is a time to take stock of where we’ve been, what we’re grateful for, and where we still want to go.\nAnd these milestones can either bring about dread or light a fire under us. For example, there’s a huge increase in the number of first time marathon runners who are age 29, 39, 49 and 59. Perhaps for many people running a marathon is an early bucket list item to check off before entering their next decade.\nAs I wrote in a previous post, happiness often increases after we reach middle age. This U-bend curve of well-being suggests that our happiness quotient continually declines from our early twenties until our mid-forties whereupon it then begins to rise well into old age. Little wonder since the mid-forties is when people are often heavily invested in demanding careers, raising teenagers and helping their aging parents.\nBy the same token, many people reach a career slump in their work when they are in their mid-forties and about halfway through their most productive working years. This slump can be attributed to many factors such as individuals are not seeing as many advancement opportunities, they no longer have the right level of challenge and satisfaction in their work, or they are no longer stimulated and simply working for a paycheck.\nIn the same way buying a sports car or starting an affair may not be the best choice in a mid-life crisis, so too might simply finding another job may not be the best choice if you’re in a mid-career slump.\nWhether it’s entering a new decade of life or simply reaching a crossroads in your career, it helps to first take stock of where you are. This could include assessing what you’ve accomplished so far, how satisfied you are at this point in your life, and acknowledging what—if anything—is holding you back from reaching more of what you want.\nWarren Buffett suggests when you reach such a mid-life slump, it’s worthwhile to make a list of your top 25 goals for the rest of your life. Then look at this list and circle your top five that are your absolute highest priority. Next, immediately begin planning how to achieve those top five goals and don’t even look at those other 20 until you achieved all five. By focusing on and achieving a few important things well is far more likely to move you out of a slump of many half-hearted and/or half-completed projects.\nDevelop a mid-career mentoring program in your organization. This is a recognition of the U-bend curve of well-being that is something we are all likely to encounter. Making this a formal program will enable more experienced employees to offer strategies for dealing with the inevitable slump. Peers can provide camaraderie and support. And having others share how they were able to inject purpose into their lives can be inspiring and motivating.\nMentally subtract positive events. To do this, you first think about something positive in your life—your marriage, birth of a child, major achievement. Second list all of the circumstances that made that possible, such as a seemingly insignificant decision of where to eat dinner one night or a class you enrolled in on a whim or the friend of a friend who happened",

By nature, most of us are overly hard on ourselves. We are all too likely to focus on our faults and where we fall short. Scarcity rather than abundance. But we should also take time to acknowledge our strengths and be compassionate in the fact that—as human beings—we are all perfectly imperfect. By writing this down and owning it, we are more likely to internalize it and accept it in a healing manner.\nNo matter where we are in life or in our career, we are on a journey. And on this journey we celebrate accomplishments and suffer setbacks. How we respond to the inevitable mid-life and mid-career slumps depends on our resilience and our ability to remain mindful of our long-term goals and priorities.

He was on his way further south to serve out the remainder of his term in another correctional facility.\nHe said James was a model prisoner.\n\"This guy's a good guy,\" Godinez said. \"He was mostly into the library, and of course exercise.\"\nAt 74, James is spry, carting his boxes around the terminal and barely breaking a sweat despite the 84-degree heat in Richmond.\nJames reminisced to Godinez about the \"good old days\" of Newark politics.\n\"It wasn't about money then, it was about issues,\" said the 74-year-old former mayor. \"What are you going to do for me, Sharpe?\"\nAfter nearly an hour delay, James pressed Greyhound officials for details on the late departure.\n\"They've been waiting for over an hour,\" James told driver Mark Boruta.

James, sentenced to serve 27 months in prison and pay a $100,000 fine, was sent to a low-security prison. Prosecutors from U.S. Attorney Chris Christie's office sought a nearly 20-year sentence for the man who had served as the face of Newark for decades.\nWhile in prison, James said he made beds, drove buses and coached fellow prisoners working toward their high school equivalency diplomas.

The FDIC measure, backed by other regulators, is designed to restore investor trust in this secondary market, which is vital to mortgage lending.\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve imposes new rules on Friday that'll end the practice of allowing mortgage brokers to receive a bonus from lenders — a legalized kickback — when they get a borrower into a loan with a higher interest rate than the rate for which they qualified. During the housing boom, lenders rewarded brokers for getting borrowers into ill-suited and often predatory loans.\n\"I think the importance of what you're seeing as you group the pieces together is the remaking of the mortgage system after the crisis ... It is very, very important,\" said Barry Zigas, the director of housing policy for the Consumer Federation of America.\nLast year's broad overhaul of financial regulation also created a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which opens for business on July 1, to better police mortgage lending.\nCongressional Republicans are trying to defund and defang the new bureau, and Tuesday, they unveiled eight bills designed to put to death mortgage finance titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two have been in government hands since September 2008.\nThe measures don't provide a timetable, but would progressively lower the limit of how many mortgage bonds the two could own over a five-year period, getting government almost completely out of mortgage finance.\n\"Today marks the start of a process,\" said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., the chairman of a subcommittee that deals with the agencies. \"The culmination of our efforts will ... return our housing system to the private marketplace.\"\nFannie and Freddie buy loans from lenders and bundle them into bonds sold to investors, a process called securitization. Wall Street took much of their bonds during the housing boom, before weak lending standards brought down the entire system of mortgage finance. Today Fannie and Freddie do about 90 percent of the pooling of new mortgages.\nThe FDIC's proposed rule seeks to have Wall Street bundlers of complex bonds retain 5 percent of any loan that isn't considered a Qualified Residential Mortgage. The FDIC defined Qualified Residential Mortgage as a loan that has a 20 percent down payment from the borrower, whose credit history is free from late payments and whose monthly mortgage payment won't exceed 31 percent of pre-tax income. Government-backed loans and those placed with Fannie and Freddie also would be exempt.\nCritics complain that this effectively would reward 1980s-",
        "baseline": "type underwriting by lenders.\n\"That's back to what the underwriting guidelines were before the drive to make credit accessible for people of low income,\" Zigas said.\nJohn Taylor, the president of the liberal National Community Reinvestment Coalition, charged in a statement that Congress and the Obama administration \"would like to limit homeownership to the well-heeled.\" That's a reference to the administration's Feb. 11 White Paper, which called for down payments of at least 10 percent for government-backed mortgages, higher than the traditional 3 percent.\nWall Street warned that attempts to improve the quality of credit could limit its extension to borrowers.\n\"Such a step could further delay the housing-market recovery and have far-reaching negative implications to the public and investors, as well as for the broader economy,\" Richard Dorfman, a managing director of the Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, said in a statement.\nStrong corporate profits amid weak economy - What's up with that?",

        "prompt": "Edward Blum has orchestrated a string of big cases targeting voting rights and affirmative action.\nWhen Supreme Court plaintiffs speak to the press on the courthouse plaza after their cases have been argued, they usually refer specific questions to their lawyers. But on December 9, after the oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas, when I threw some queries at 25-year-old Abigail Fisher, she deferred not to her lawyer, but to “Edward,” the dapper, gray-haired man who had accompanied her to the hearing. Edward Blum is not an attorney, but he deserves much of the credit for getting Fisher’s case before the high court. Eight years ago, the mild-mannered 64-year-old former stockbroker recruited Fisher for his legal challenge to the consideration of race in college admissions, and he arranged a lawyer and financing for her case.\nThose two cases were just the latest instances of Blum’s success at getting the high court to hear objections to the legal legacy of the civil rights movement. Over the past two decades, Blum has orchestrated about a dozen suits inspired by what he says is his desire to create a “color-blind” society. Four have made it to the Supreme Court since 2009.\nBlum started his crusade in the 1990s after running for Congress as a Republican in the heavily Democratic Texas district once represented by civil rights activist Barbara Jordan. After he lost soundly, he spent $75,000 of his own money to file a legal challenge to what he saw as the district’s racial gerrymandering—the zigzagging boundaries that had been drawn to boost its minority population and to protect incumbents. Blum and the other plaintiffs he recruited for the case, known as Bush v. Vera, went all the way to the Supreme Court in 1995. A 5-4 decision, authored by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, forced Texas to redraw the boundaries of two majority-black districts and one majority-Hispanic district.\nBlum went on to set up the Project on Fair Representation in 2005. Until recently, it was funded by a secretive network of conservative donors and foundations that footed the bill for its lawsuits. As the organization’s director and sole employee, Blum recruits new plaintiffs and connects them with conservative lawyers such as William Consovoy, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas who’s worked on some of Blum’s most successful cases.\nOne of those cases was Shelby County v. Holder, which the conservative justices used to gut a section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of voter discrimination to clear any changes to their voting rules with the Justice Department. The 2013 decision paved the way for new restrictions, such as expanded voter ID requirements, that have made it more difficult for African Americans and Latinos to cast ballots in Southern states.\nBlum insists he is fighting for civil rights, and he is adamant that he’s not just seeking white plaintiffs with racial axes to grind. “Groups like mine are not looking for Donald Trump-type supporters. We are looking for people who have honest, levelheaded opinions about equal representation. We reject people who are anti-immigrant. We reject people who are anti-Muslim. We reject people who have an antithetical view of American civil rights laws.” He says his efforts to find plaintiffs are no different from what civil rights groups and “the marriage equality people” do.\nHer co-plaintiff, Ed Pfenninger, is a Christian fundamentalist who has a YouTube channel where he’s posted hours of videos on his viewpoints. He doesn’t believe the Earth revolves around the sun. He has described the Catholic Church as “the mother of harlots,” said Jews are “enemies of the cross,” and cited the Bible to justify his belief that women with short hair are shameful.\nBlum, who says he’s known Pfenninger for 15 years, was unfamiliar with his views on science and outraged at any suggestion that he should have vetted Pfenninger’s religious beliefs. “These are civil rights cases,” Blum told me. “I don’t need to quiz everyone about their views on climate change, evolution, or global warming. I just need to know that someone is not a bigot.” When I directed Blum to some of Pfenninger’s and Evenwel’s more inflammatory statements, he replied with a short email. “I remain persuaded that my clients are not bigots, racists, or anti-Semites,” he wrote. When Evenwel was subsequently heard by the Supreme Court in December, its two plaintiffs did not appear before the press on the courthouse steps.\nCourt watchers and civil rights advocates believe the Fisher case might be a warm-up for a couple of “sleeper” cases that could deal a death blow to affirmative action in college admissions.\nIt took Blum nearly three years to find a friendly face for his attack on the affirmative action program at the University of Texas, his alma mater. He even set up a website called UTNotFair to attract potential plaintiffs. In the end, he settled on Fisher, the daughter of an acquaintance.\nFisher has said she filed her suit because UT-Austin rejected her while letting in her black and Hispanic high school classmates with lower grades. However, her grades and test scores would not have won her a spot at UT even if she had been black, according to documents filed by the university. Nor was she completely shut out: The university told her that if she attended another campus in the Texas system for a year and maintained a B average, she could transfer to Austin—an offer she rejected. (Fisher",
        "baseline": " has since graduated from Louisiana State University.) During oral arguments, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg quizzed Fisher’s lawyer about what compensation Fisher could possibly gain at this point. The answer was, essentially, her application fee of roughly $100.\nCourt watchers and civil rights advocates believe the Fisher case might be a warm-up for a couple of Blum’s “sleeper” cases that could deal a death blow to affirmative action in college admissions. An organization Blum created, Students for Fair Admissions, is suing Harvard University, accusing it of discriminating against Asian American applicants and drawing comparisons to the university’s past record of bias against Jews. The complaint, filed in federal court in Boston in November 2014, argues that exceptionally qualified Asian kids, including many with perfect SAT scores, are being shut out because Harvard wants to limit their numbers. Blum’s group has launched a similar case against the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.",

It will do so for a maximum of 18 months.\nOfficial figures show that a year later, seven out of 10 of these PMETs are still employed.\nWhat's more, about 70 per cent of these newly employed PMETS stayed with the same employer, an indication that the programme has found them jobs that are a good fit. The remaining 30 per cent went to work for another employer.\nSecond Manpower Minister Josephine Teo painted this successful picture of the CSP in Parliament on Wednesday (Jan 10), in her response to Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera, who wanted to know its effectiveness.\nMore than 1,100 PMETs have used the programme since it started in October 2015 and over nine in 10 of them are aged 40 and older.\nMrs Teo said more than eight in 10 of all these PMETs had been looking for work for at least six months.\nAnother bright spot in the picture is the increased number of job placements achieved by the scheme. It has risen from about 200 in the first three-quarters of 2016 to more than 800 in the same period last year.\nAbout half the employers on the CSP are small and medium-sized enterprises.\nMrs Teo also gave figures on the Professional Conversion Programmes, which help PMETs find jobs in growth sectors and get the necessary skills training for",
        "baseline": " these jobs.\nIn the first three-quarters of last year, about 2,700 PMETs found work under these programmes, up from 900 in the same period in 2016, she said.\nLabour MP Patrick Tay (West Coast GRC) suggested the Government do more to make the CSP more attractive to small businesses, like paying the wage subsidy automatically when an employer hires a person who fits the criteria.\nMrs Teo said a system would not be able to determine automatically if an employer declines to pay a higher salary, which is what the wage subsidy aims to address.\nShe added that in light of recent discussions on the fraudulent use of government schemes, greater care is necessary to ensure wage support is given \"in cases that are really deserving\".\n\"Can we improve on the application and processing, can we make sure the employer doesn't have to wait too long, the answer to that is 'yes', but always maintaining a certain rigour of assesment,\" she said.",

Players said he was insensitive, though others defended him.\n-- On Dec. 17, James said Leach told trainers to put him \"the darkest place you can find.\" James was sent to an equipment shed near the practice field, where a member of the athletic staff checked on James to make sure he did not lean against anything or sit on the floor. James said Leach told him that if he came out he would be kicked off the team.\n-- When the team returned to practice two days later, on Dec. 19, James said Leach told trainers to \"find the tightest, darkest place\" for the player. James, in his street clothes, was put in an electrical closet inside the football stadium for hours, again monitored by a member of the athletic staff.\nThe person close to the inquiry said James spent two hours Dec. 17 in a shed the size of a one-car garage that was filled with coolers and that the player was \"caught\" sitting down on one. All the coolers then were removed, the person said, and the door to the shed was closed with James inside.\nLiggett said he has a letter from the doctor who examined James that supports Leach's actions.\n\"He was not hurt by what happened in the equipment room,\" the lawyer said. \"And Mike did not do anything to worsen the situation, in fact he put him in a safer environment by being inside.\"\nTurner said the investigation is being handled by the school president's office, with the assistance of its general counsel and athletic director Gerald Myers.\nThe NCAA is letting Texas Tech conduct its investigation and has not gotten involved, NCAA spokesman Cameron Schuh said. The Big 12 has no authority to investigate what the conference labeled an \"institutional matter,\" Big 12 spokesman Bob Burda said.\nTexas Tech players,",

That's just his way of doing it. He tries to push us, tries to make us better and tries to make us men and get the best of our ability out of us.\"\nJames was with the team in San Antonio as it prepares for Saturday's bowl game against Michigan State.

        "prompt": "ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: This is the story of a man who swore to uphold the law, to protect and serve, to safeguard the public. That was his promise. That's how it began for a Los Angeles police cadet named Christopher Dorner.\nIt ended of course in a fiery shoot-out after a deadly manhunt capping a reign of terror. His promise to protect had become a vow of vengeance, his duty to serve a mission to mete out punishment to the men, women and families of the police force that fired him.\nIn the hour ahead, every moment that mattered, from the roots of his rage, the terror he inflicted, to the inferno that consumed him.\nThis is A.C. 360 special, \"Killer Cop: Inside the Hunt for Christopher Dorner.\"\nRANDI KAYE, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Anderson.\nIt's been a terrifying two weeks for law enforcement in Southern California as a lone gunman and ex-cop fueled by anger set out on a killing rampage. Tonight from Los Angeles, we bring you the story of one man who waged a deadly war of retribution and take you inside one of the largest manhunts in Los Angeles police history.\nKAYE (voice-over): For almost a decade, Irvine, California has been known as the safest city in America. But in Early February, this L.A. Scene was the scene of a terrible double murder, a crime at the time that offered no hint of the terror to come.\nSGT. NOELLE SMILEY, IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT: Call came out at 9:10 this evening at 2100 Scholarship at a parking structure.\nKAYE: It was February 3 at 9:10 p.m. when Irvine police responded to a tip and found 27-year-old Keith Lawrence and his 28- year-old fiancee, Monica Quan. Both had been shot dead in Lawrence's parked car. Each had been shot multiple times.\nSMILEY: We are trying to figure out what happened.\nKAYE: Initially, police had no motive and no leads. Lawrence was a well-liked former college basketball player who had just begun a law enforcement career as a University of Southern California safety officer. And Quan, the daughter of a former Los Angeles police captain, was a beloved assistant basketball coach at Cal State Fullerton.\nMARCIA FOSTER, BASKETBALL COACH: A really bright light was put out way too soon.\nKAYE: The pair's senseless killing left a community in shock, and police searching for answers. Three days later, a break in the case.\nDAVID MAGGARD, IRVINE POLICE CHIEF: Today, we have identified Christopher Dorner as a suspect in this double homicide. Dorner was an LAPD officer through 2009 and a reservist for the United States Navy. Of particular interest at this point in the organization is a multipage manifesto, in which the suspect has implicated himself in the slayings.\nKAYE: Dorner's angry manifesto was much more than a clue. Posted on Facebook, it was a clear and direct threat aimed at members of the LAPD who Dorner claimed ended his law enforcement career. In his manifesto, Dorner warned that his targets would include not only police, but their family members as well, writing -- quote -- \"I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own. I'm terminating yours.\"\nDorner's chilling manifesto made clear Monica Quan's murder was far from random. It was Quan's father who had unsuccessfully represented Dorner in a disciplinary hearing that resulted in his dismissal from the LAPD four years earlier.\nMIKE BROOKS, CNN SECURITY ANALYST: Him basically stalking Ms. Quan and her fiancee, this was a guy, a man on a mission for revenge.\nKAYE: Targeted by one of their own, the Los Angeles Police Department ordered special units to provide 24-hour protection to the dozens of people named in Dorner's manifesto.\nMAGGARD: We have strong cause to believe Dorner is armed and dangerous.\nKAYE: This video obtained exclusively by CNN shows Dorner just 12 hours after the Irvine killings apparently placing a military belt, a helmet and ammunition behind an auto parts store near San Diego.\nCHARLIE BECK, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, POLICE CHIEF: Of course he knows what he's doing. We trained him. He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the police officers involved.\nKAYE: Hours after that press conference with Southern California police on high alert, at 10:30 p.m., Dorner slipped into this San Diego marina, boarded a boat and surprised its owner.\nLT. DAVID ROHOWITZ, SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT: He pointed a handgun at the victim who was an 81-year-old male and demanded the boat. KAYE: Dorner told the man he wanted to flee to Mexico.\nROHOWITZ: The suspect then attempted to start the boat.\nKAYE: But a rope became caught in the boat's propeller, delaying Dorner's escape.\nROHOWITZ: At that point the suspect, according to the victim, became frustrated, took a few small items, including cell phone and some other miscellaneous items from inside the boat, tied the victim up and left in an unknown direction.\nBROOKS: He didn't harm the 81-year-old man. Why? I think because he wasn't a cop.\nKAYE: Days before the killings in Irvine, surveillance cameras captured images of Dorner purchasing scuba gear.\nBROOKS: You could use that against officers coming in with tear gas. Was he trying to maybe attack someone by coming up behind them, under them, on a boat? We don't know.\nKAYE: And just as the police had begun zeroing their attention on the scene of the failed boat theft in San Diego, Dorner was spotted begin, this time 90 miles north. At approximately 1:24 a.m., two Los Angeles police officers on protective duty in the Los Angeles suburb of Corona were flagged down by a man who had spotted Dorner's truck at a nearby gas station. The police followed the truck.\nSGT. RUDY LOPEZ, LAPD: Exiting the freeway, the officers made that turn to eastbound where the suspect exited the vehicle, was out of the vehicle immediately with a shoulder weapon and started to shoot at the officers. The officers took cover, returned fire.\nKAYE: In the resulting exchange of gunfire, one bullet grazed a responding officer's head. And their patrol car was so damaged, they couldn't chase Dorner as he drove away.\nKAYE: Although he was being hunted, Dorner was not finished doing the hunting; 20 minutes after his shoot-out in Corona, in nearby Riverside, as an 11-year police officer and his trainee were stopped at a red light, Dorner pulled up beside them and opened fire.\nVeteran officer Michael Crain, a father of two, was killed. His 27-year-old trainee was critically wounded.\nBECK: The Riverside officers were cowardly ambushed. They had no opportunity to fight back, no pre-warning.\nBROOKS: You know, when I first think about Dorner, words that come to mind, coward, vindictive, cold-blooded, deadly. KAYE: In less than a week, Christopher Dorner had killed three people, wounded two, left an entire region on edge and sparked the largest manhunt in Los Angeles police history. CINDY BACHMAN, SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S OFFICE: There was a murder and attempted murder of three law enforcement officers today. The person responsible for that is still on the street. And we don't know what he's going to do.\nKAYE: The race to track down the highly trained former cop had begun. And the clock was ticking.\nKAYE: The former LAPD officer now has thousands of his brothers in blue chasing him. But just who was Christopher Dorner?\nCNN's Kyung Lah looks at what lit the fuse that caused this explosive rampage.\nKYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Christopher Dorner, target of the largest manhunt in LAPD history, a vengeful ex-cop, highly trained marksman, armed and dangerous, turning against the very agency that defined him.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He loved being a cop. He wanted to be a cop his whole life.\nLAH: The Chris Dorner who was terrorizing California is far from the sunny upbringing of his Southern California childhood. He grew up in Los Angeles's sprawling suburbs with his mother and sister attending Norwalk Christian Elementary School. It's here where we get Dorner's first sense of being wronged.\nIn his manifesto, he writes a fellow student calls him the N-word on the school's playground. Dorner fights the student. Then he writes, he's appalled when the principal encourages him to turn the other cheek. In high school, Dorner writes about another incident. An assistant principal lied to Dorner's mother about the theft of a watch, something Dorner writes, \"I never forgot.\"\nJAMES USERA, KNEW CHRISTOPHER DORNER: He just told me that when he was in grade school, he would get picked on.\nJames Usera was Dorner's college friend. Dorner shared stories of his childhood bullying when they were teammates on Southern Utah University's football team.\nUSERA: The one thing I do remember about Chris was that he was sensitive to racial issues, race relations in general.\nLAH (on camera): It made an impression on him? USERA: I'm sure it did. Again, I think it would make an impression on anybody.\nLAH (voice-over): Aaron Alford coached Dorner, a scholarship running back at Southern Utah. He was good in class, fit in with the team. But Alford said he stuck out in the same way Alford did.\nAARON ALFORD, COACHED DORNER: Obviously, as a young African male coming to Southern Utah University, there were those culture shock moments. He really as far as race and racism, that was something that he was very sensitive too. He was one to call them out on it. He wasn't going to sit back and let it -- brush it under the rug like it's OK.\nLAH: Usera describes Dorner as a man who saw the world as black and white, right and wrong.\nUSERA: One of the things I always respected about Chris was the fact that he was a person of very strong convictions and a person with a lot of integrity and honesty.\nLAH (on camera): What code of ethics did he live by?\nUSERA: Chris, as much as anybody, he believes in right and wrong. If you do wrong, you should be punished, and if you do right, you should live your life that way.\nLAH (voice-over): One of the last times Usera saw Dorner was on campus, signing up for the Navy as he graduated in 2001.\nBROOKS: If you look at his record, there's nothing really outstanding in there. He was, it sounded like, a competent Navy officer. Didn't rise up that far.\nLAH: But the Navy Reserve lieutenant was good at one thing, shooting, rated a rifle marksman and a pistol expert, a skill apparent when he joined the LAPD on February 7, 2005. The man who gave CNN this video did not want to be identified, but talked so you could see what the LAPD was up against.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You look at Chris, you can see that he's a little bit of an expert. Watch. He disarms. He will shoot. And almost no movement when he shoots the gun and then pop like nothing.\nLAH (on camera): So, he stood out?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, he stood out. He knew what he was doing.\nLAH: Being a cop, could you tell that it was important to him?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I think it was very important to him, yes.\nLAH: You could see it?\nLAH: Even during the training?\nI think it's a 300-pound dummy and he does that easily. LAH: So, this is a very strong man?\nLAH (voice-over): But not everything was easy for the aspiring police officer. Drill instructors picked on him for his weight and slow running.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was always struggling, and I thought, maybe because he's a big guy everybody is picking on him. A couple of times, he would respond sort of aggressively. And he would yell back a little bit louder than anybody else would. He would be like, yes, drill instructor, or like OK.\nLAH: Dorner did not complete the police academy until the next class, because of an accidental discharge of his gun wounding his hand. The police suspended him for two days. The rookie cop eventually started working at the LAPD harbor unit. He was working there in 2006 when Ariana Williams met him.\nARIANA WILLIAMS, EX-GIRLFRIEND: We only dated for probably three months at the most. It was a very quick, intense romance.\nLAH: One that ended badly. Williams feeling scorned, posted Dorner's name and his badge number on dontdatehimgirl.com, a social networking site. Williams describes verbal abuse, that Dorner was super-paranoid, he had a color problem, writing, \"This man really hated himself because he's black.\"\nWILLIAMS: It was obviously some sort of issue for him, the racial thing.\nLAH (on camera): You did state in the post that you felt like he was almost a self-hating black man?\nWILLIAMS: Well, I did as far as him identifying with himself as a black man in America. I just noticed that there were some discrepancies there, for me from the outside looking in.\nLAH (voice-over): Like Dorner telling Williams she was the first black girl he ever dated. Williams says Dorner had severe mood swings calling it good Chris/bad Chris. Dorner filed a temporary restraining order against Williams after he saw her posting.\n(on camera): So this was the bad Chris?\nWILLIAMS: This was the bad Chris.\nLAH (voice-over): The court case was eventually dismissed. Soon after, the military called him up for a yearlong deployment. He never saw active duty. But when he came back, according to police records, he struggled to fit in once again. In 2007, Dorner's training officer reports while on duty, he was crying and demanded to be taken back to the station to talk to the training unit.\nThe next week, Dorner reported training Teresa Evans to the LAPD for kicking a disabled man in an incident outside of a DoubleTree Hotel, a report that would ultimately lead to his dismissal. Dorner told Usera about his problems with the LAPD the last time the two men spoke.\n(on camera): Can you see how a man like that, if he believes he's telling the truth, that could drive him to something like this?\nUSERA: There's absolutely no excuse or justification that would make what's going on now OK. But the truth is the truth. And again, I mean, I believe Chris Dorner's a truth-teller.\nLAH: Given his personality and his strong belief to tell the truth, can you see how it might cause him to have a psychotic break of some sort?\nUSERA: That's got to be pretty devastating for a guy who, again, lived his life by a certain code of ethics and believed himself to be an honest man.\nLAH (voice-over): The man who friends say saw the world in black and white was fired from the LAPD for making false statements against his training officer. He lost every appeal to get his job back.\nDorner writes in his manifesto, his firing triggered severe depression. On February 7 of this year, exactly eight years from the very day he stepped into the academy as a new recruit, Christopher Dorner began to kill police officers. The LAPD now had to hunt down a man who was once one of their own before he killed again.\nKAYE (voice-over): Where would Christopher Dorner go?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're trying to find the scene.\nKAYE: Who would be his next target?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An officer-involved shooting here.\nKAYE: An entire region on edge.\nBECK: Of course he knows what he's doing. We trained him. He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the police officers involved. ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA (D), MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES: I think there was a level of anxiety and fear that permeated our city and the region.\nKAYE: Police were on high alert and on the lookout for Dorner's truck. Officers in Torrance thought they spotted it. Shots rang out. Passenger and driver were injured, but instead of a cop killer, they had shot at two innocent people.\nBROOKS: Apparently, they tried to pull over, didn't pull over, and they shot at them. Well, it was some people delivering newspapers.\nKAYE: Soon after, just blocks away, officers fired at another truck, another mistake. This time, no one was hurt.\nVILLARAIGOSA: Remember that this was almost within minutes, hours of what happened in Riverside and so there was a heightened sense of apprehension. And I could just tell you that there was frayed nerves.\nKAYE: Police were on a hair-trigger response. Tensions were running high. They were the targets named in Dorner's manifesto.\nThe subject line reads, \"Last Resort.\" It is the only explanation we will ever hear from Christopher Dorner, over 11,000 words posted on his Facebook page, addressed simply to America. It is pages and pages of threats, confessions and rambling opinions. And it is chilling to read.\n\"I know most of you who personally know me, you are saying to yourself that this is completely out of character of the man you knew who always wore a smile wherever he was seen. I know I will be vilified by the LAPD and the media. Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy, but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The question is, what would you do to clear your name?\"\nUSERA: You see that smiling face, and that's the Chris I know. And -- but at the same time, again, he's being accused of some pretty horrific crimes.\nKAYE: James Usera is mentioned in the manifesto as a great friend by Dorner.\nUSERA: Initially, it was sort of shock and befuddlement and disbelief, and this is not the Chris Dorner that I know.\nKAYE: They were college friends. Usera last spoke with him in 2008 after Dorner was terminated from the LAPD for making false statements to a superior officer.\nThe termination is at the root of Dorner's rampage. He is clearly looking for vindication. \"The attacks will stop when the department states the truth about my innocence publicly.\" Dorner writes: \"I will not accept any type of currency, goods in exchange for the attacks to stop, nor do I want it. I want my name back, period. There is no negotiation.\"\nKris Mohandie, a former LAPD psychologist, never treated Dorner but has studied his writings for clues to his mental state.\nKRIS MOHANDIE, FORMER LAPD PSYCHOLOGIST: Dorner was absolutely obsessed with his grievance with the police department, his sense of having been wrongly treated, wrongly terminated. And this was the thing that he lived with day in and day out, couldn't let go.\nKAYE: The shooter urges the media to investigate his case. \"With the discovery and evidence available, you will see the truth. Unfortunately, I will not be alive to see my name cleared.\"\nHe writes repeatedly about dying. \"I have nothing to lose. You cannot prevail against an enemy combatant who has no fear of death.\"\nDorner promises \"The violence of action will be high\" and lists his targets by name, all members of the LAPD. \"In essence, I have lost everything, because the LAPD took my name, and knew I was innocent. Your day has come.\"\nMOHANDIE: He thinks he's special. He's entitled, he's narcissistic, and believes he gets to act as judge, jury and executioner and strike at these people he perceives have wronged him.\nKAYE: He threatens that \"Suppressing the truth will lead to deadly consequences for you and your family.\" He made good on that promise when he shot and killed Monica Quan and her fiancee. Her father was named by Dorner in an ominous threat.\n\"Look your wives, husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead.\" Ironically, Dorner also uses his manifesto to talk about gun control, even offering his views on the victims of Virginia Tech, Newtown and other mass shootings.\n\"Remember the innocent children,\" he writes. \"Make sure this never happens again.\"\nMOHANDIE: The fact that he's talking about other incidents like Newtown, for example, and innocent victims, yet then he's choosing to target innocent victims who he's now labeled as not innocent because they're part of the body that has wronged him, this is hypocrisy.\nKAYE: Whether his claims are valid or not, Dorner's tone in the manifesto is unwavering. He's on a crusade to purge the LAPD of corruption.\nHe writes: \"No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer. It was against everything I ever was. As a young police explorer, I found my calling in life, but as a young police officer, I found that the violent suspects on the street are not the only people you have to watch.\"\nThough most of the rant is devoted to his anger at the LAPD, Dorner also bizarrely offers his opinions on politics, celebrities and pop culture, and even discusses the first lady's haircut. \"Off the record, I love your new bangs, Mrs. Obama.\" He writes, \"A woman whose professional and educational accomplishments are second to none when compared to recent first wives.\"\nMOHANDIE: All of a sudden, he starts talking about these various Hollywood people, the president of the United States. And this is his way of conveying, I'm an important person now. Because I have done these outrageous things, it's elevated me into a position of notoriety.\nKAYE: Mohandie says that narcissism led Dorner to reach out to CNN's Anderson Cooper, who received a package from Dorner in the mail -- details of that bizarre package next.\nKAYE: The 360 special edition, \"Killer Cop: Inside the Hunt for Christopher Dorner,\" continues in a moment. First, the latest on other stories that we're following.\nPresident Obama was in Chicago today talking about gun violence in a speech at a high school near where he used to live. The president called for Congress to vote on a package of gun control proposals. He said children who live in violent neighborhoods needs help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to change their lives.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is not just a gun issue. It's also an issue of the kinds of communities we're building. For that, we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it. We all share a responsibility to move this country closer to our founding vision that, no matter who you are or where you come from, here in America, you can decide your own destiny. You can succeed if you work hard and fulfill your responsibilities.\nKAYE: Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius was in court in South Africa today, accused of murdering his model girlfriend. The case has shocked South Africa and people all over the world who were inspired by the athlete known as Blade Runner for his prosthetic legs. Pistorius broke down and sobbed when the judge officially charged him with murder. A bail hearing is set for Tuesday.\nAs part of a plea deal with federal prosecutors, former congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has admitted misusing campaign funds. The plea agreement says Jackson and his wife spent some $750,000 in campaign money to buy everything from furs to Michael Jackson memorabilia. As part of the deal, Jackson has to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nAbout 1,000 people were hurt when a meteor strike -- streaked across the Russian sky exploding with a sonic boom that shattered glass in buildings. NASA says the explosion was the equivalent of 300,000 tons of TNT.\nAnd play at the women's Australian Open golf tournament was interrupted in the first round by kangaroos. It's dry this time of year, and apparently, the kangaroos are drawn to the lush courses or maybe they just really like golf.\nMore serious fare ahead. The 360 special edition, \"Killer Cop Inside the Hunt for Christopher Dorner,\" continues in just a moment.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KAYE: After Christopher Dorner's manifesto came to life, another strange turn. Kyung Lah has the details of a package he sent to our own Anderson Cooper.\nKYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The package sent by Christopher Dorner was bizarre. Anderson Cooper described the con tents in detail on AC 360.\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: The suspect, Christopher Dorner, also reached out to me directly, mailing a parcel to my office that arrived on the first of this month. My assistant opened it. Inside he found this hand-labeled DVD accompanied by a yellow Post-It note reading in part, quote, \"I never lied,\" apparently a reference to his 2008 dismissal from the LAPD.\nLAH: Dorner was fired from the department for making false statements after accusing an LAPD training officer of kicking a mentally unstable man. The chief who fired him, Bill Bratton. Bratton gave Dorner this personal coin bearing the chief's own name.\nCOOPER: Also in the package, as I mentioned, a coin wrapped in duct tape. Now the tape bearing a hand-written inscription: \"Thanks but no thanks, Bill Bratton.\" Obviously, his former boss. And here's the coin again. You can see the bullet holes, three to the center, another nicked off the top of that.\nLAH: After learning of its contents, Anderson's assistant notified CNN's head of security, who alerted Chief Bratton and law enforcement. The former LAPD chief said he gave the coins to a lot of officers but doesn't remember the meeting with Dorner. He doesn't question the firing.\nBILL BRATTON, FORMER LAPD CHIEF: Quite clearly, in his mind, I was among those responsible for his problems, his dismissal from the department. Clearly I was. I was the chief of police. I fired him, but I have no regrets about that.\nLAH: Was the package Dorner sent to Anderson a cry for justice in the court of public opinion, where the legal system had failed him?\nIn the manifesto Dorner posted online, he writes, \"The LAPD hasn't changed since the days of Rodney King. It has gotten worse\"\nDorner picks at an old painful scab in Los Angeles: the LAPD and its troubled history with the black community.\nDOMINIQUE DIPRIMA, KJLH RADIO: Radio Free 103.2, KJLH, Compton, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Inglewood. Today we're talking about Christopher Dorner. We're talking about the LAPD.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I believe what he's doing really is no different than our ancestors would have done and did do in fighting to get free.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not that people don't have a right to be angry. It's what you do about the anger.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The debate isn't limited to talk radio. Across the web, a small but vocal show of report: Facebook pages like these. Call this disgusting say critics, but much of it is tinged with the sense of injustice dating back decades, from the Watts riots of 1965 to the 1991 Rodney King beating and the Rampart scandal of the late '90s.\nCONNIE RICE, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: LAPD's relationship with the black community could only be described as a state of war.\nLAH: Civil rights attorney Connie rice sued the department for years before joining it as an advisor to the chief to change the police force from the inside.\nRICE: I know that history well. I represented over 100 African- American and other minority officers. And we've been doing battle, hand-to-hand combat with LAPD to get LAPD to change.\nLAH: Rice says that battle is paying off. Today minorities make up more than half of its force. And something that was unthinkable years ago, L.A.'s current police chief, Charlie Beck reopening the investigation into Dorner's firing. He did it while his officers continued the manhunt.\nCHIEF CHARLIE BECK, LAPD: I hear the ghosts of past of the Los Angeles Police Department. I hear that people think that maybe there is something to what he says. And I want to put that to rest. If there is anything to what he says, or anything new in what he brings up in his manifesto, we will deal with it, and we will deal with it in a public way.\nCOMMANDER ANDREW SMITH, LAPD: He's not opening it because of the accusations or because of the musings of someone who's a multiple murderer now. He's doing it because he wants to ensure that the public knows that the Los Angeles Police Department is fair and transparent. And he wants to go through everything and have a fresh set of eyes look at the entire investigation now.\nRICE: Let's not merge the past with today. And let's separate out the possibility that Mr. Dorner has raised legitimate issues from the complete illegitimacy and obscenity of what he's done. LAH: The LAPD fighting its own demons while it chased the devil.\nKAYE: Christopher Dorner's shooting spree had put his former law- enforcement colleagues on notice. Police were scrambling to provide protection for dozens of targets, waiting nervously for Dorner's next move.\nKAYE (voice-over): Dorner had already shot and killed three people and wounded two others. But there were still no leads on his whereabouts. Then a discovery suddenly shifted focus to the other side of the state.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're just learning that a burned-out truck near Big Bear Lake, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, belongs to Christopher Jordan Dorner.\nKAYE: Guns were found in the truck, and footprints in the snow.\nSHERIFF JOHN MCMAHON, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY: I can tell you we did find some tracks around the vehicle, but they did not lead to the suspect.\nMIKE BROOKS, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: They brought in canine units to try to get a scent, and apparently they couldn't get a scent.\nMCMAHON: We are continuing the door-to-door search in the immediate area. We have air resources, depending on the weather. It will depend whether they continue flying tonight. There's about 125 law enforcement officers in this general area, both tracking as well as doing the door to door searches .\nKAYE: In addition to the weather, the desperate search was complicated by vast and difficult terrain. Investigators discovered two links to Dorner in the snowy mountains. One was land owned by his mother.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is an undeveloped piece of property.\nKAYE: The other, according to this federal arrest affidavit, was residential property not far from the burnt-out truck. It had a connection to a known associate of Dorner. But the fugitive was nowhere to be found.\nThe affidavit also revealed that a detective found Dorner's wallet and identification cards near the U.S./Mexico border and recent descriptions of someone matching Dorner's description attempting to flee to Mexico.\nNot far from the border, near San Diego, a moment of hope. A possible Dorner sighting, but that phoned-in tip turned out to be a hoax, another dead-end. BROOKS: Somebody says, \"Hey, I sighted Dorner here. I sighted Dorner -- I saw Dorner there,\" you've got to run those leading out. You've got to make sure that you dot all the \"I's\" and cross all the \"T's,\" because you've got a cold-blooded killer out there.\nKAYE: By now the relentless investigation had reached Las Vegas, where Dorner's house was searched. Day three, and La Palma became another stop on the manhunt to search the home of Dorner's mother.\nBROOKS: So they're going to check out his friends, his family, acquaintances, anybody at all who he may have had contact with in the last year, to find out, OK, have you had any contact with this guy? Has he been using any kind of credit cards, ATM cards? Has he been texting? Has he been Twittering? Has he been on Facebook, e-mails?\nKAYE: Day four, still no sign. Big Bear continued to be ground zero in the hunt for Christopher Dorner. That evening the Los Angeles Police Department announced a new investigative strategy, a joint task force.\nInside our task force are officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, the Irvine Police Department, Riverside Police Department, the FBI, the U.S. Marshalls Service and other allied law enforcement agencies throughout Southern California and throughout the region.\nKAYE: Day five, Sunday, Dorner remained on the loose.\nBECK: Every day that Dorner is loose the likelihood of an attack on either a uniformed police officer or a family of a police officer is likely.\nKAYE: Southern California remained gripped by fear and uncertainty. A home improvement store was evacuated in L.A. after the mere mention of a Dorner sighting.\nThe Los Angeles police were finding themselves spread too thin between the ongoing manhunt and extra security at the Grammy Awards. They announced that low priority radio calls might go unanswered.\nMAYOR ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, LOS ANGELES: There was a tremendous strain on resources. Remember, that we had to protect the 50 people that were targeted, protect their families, as well. We were on a tactical alert for virtually most of that time. But I said to the chief, and we both agreed, don't spare any expense.\nKAYE: The mayor turned to the citizens of Los Angeles to help catch a killer.\nVILLARAIGOSA: Leaders from throughout the region, including leaders from businesses and unions, government, law enforcement and community groups, came together to pool resources and protect our core value of public safety. Collectively, this group that, by my office, is posting a reward of $1 million for information that will lead to Mr. Dorner's capture.\nKAYE: The public responded. Tips came flooding in. Now numbering more than 1,000.\nLT. ANDY NEIMAN, LAPD: The investigation will prioritize those clues based on the information that we receive. And those clues will be followed up on immediately.\nKAYE: As leads were followed up, the hunt moved into day 6 and then day 7. Dozens of L.A. Police Department families feared to be targets of Dorner were still under 24-hour protection.\nThe heavily-armed killer was out there somewhere, still in hiding, but not for long. He would soon be heading into a deadly stand-off.\nKAYE: Not far from where Dorner had abandoned his burned out truck, Jim and Karen Reynolds walked into their cabin and into Christopher Dorner's hideout. He tied them up.\nJIM REYNOLDS, HELD HOSTAGE BY DORNER: Once he got us bound, then he went out to the bathroom real quick, which was close, and came back with a couple wash cloths, stuck one in each of our mouths.\nKAYE: Dorner stole their vehicle and fled down Highway 38. As he made his escape, Karen Reynolds, hands still tied, searched for her phone.\nKAREN REYNOLDS, HELD HOSTAGE BY DORNER: And he'd left my cell phone right on the coffee table, right there, and I sat down and was able to scoot around and work with it and call 911.\nKAYE: Dorner didn't have time to get far. Two California Fish and Wildlife wardens spotted Dorner driving.\nLT. PATRICK FOY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE: They were approaching two buses. They passed the two buses, and they noticed tucked in behind the bus was the suspect vehicle.\nKAYE: Dorner sped up, apparently lost control, and crashed his car, then fled on foot, escaping yet again. Camp ranger Rick Heltebrake was the next to encounter the elusive killer.\nRICK HELTEBRAKE, CARJACKING VICTIM: I was driving up this side road in my camp, and I was coming up to a right-hand curve. I noticed some movement over in the trees off to the left side. And before I could even process that, I saw Mr. Dorner coming out of the snow at me with a rifle pointed at my head. I stopped, put my truck into park, put my hands up. And he said, \"I don't want to hurt you. Just get out and start walking up the road and take your dog.\"\nI asked him if I could take my leash with me, and he said, \"No. Just start walking.\" And that's what I did.\nKAYE (on camera): So he told you to start walking, take your dog. What happened next? HELTEBRAKE: That's exactly what I did. I started walking up the road. I got up the road a little ways, ten, 15 seconds later, and I heard a round of gunshots.\nKAYE (voice-over): It was Dorner shooting at Fish and Wildlife officers. One bullet came within inches of a warden's head. That warden returned fire: 20 rounds. Dorner sped away.\nSoon he was forced to abandon Heltebrake's truck and ran towards a cabin. Police quickly surrounded it. They'd finally cornered their target, but the showdown was just beginning.\nA local CBS reporter captured the scene when Dorner opened fire on San Bernardino sheriff's deputies.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are shots fired, four or five shots fired.\nKAYE: And then the words no officer wants to hear.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Officer down, officer down.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Medic ships in the air. Medic ships in the air. Officer down.\nKAYE: One deputy was wounded, another killed.\nNEIMAN: It was horrifying. To listen to that firefight and to hear those words, \"Officer down,\" is the most gut-wrenching experience that you can have as a police officer.\nKAYE: Dorner had barricaded himself inside the cabin.\nBROOKS: So now you have a stand-off at the cabin. They say they have them pinned down. What does that mean?\nKAYE: Was anyone else inside? Anyone else in danger? And what else was in Dorner's arsenal?\nBROOKS: We don't know, but a short time later, we see smoke coming from the cabin. Later, we see heavy fire.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Guys, be ready on the No. 4 side. We have fire in the front. He might come out the back.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sixty-one Lincoln. We have ammo exploding inside.\nTwo and four side are fully engulfed. Fire moving to three now.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Copy. Numbers two and four, fully engulfed.\nBROOKS: San Bernardino Sheriff's Department went in with armored personnel vehicles that had the capability of going in and tearing down walls.\nKAYE: Demolition, fire and a single shot from inside the cabin.\nCPT. GREGG HERBERT, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT: Which was a much different sounding shot from the shots we'd been -- when he had been shooting at us.\nKAYE: The cabin was destroyed, the charred remains of Christopher Dorner identified.\nCPT. KEVIN LACY, RIVERSIDE COUNTY CORONER OFFICE: The information that we have right now seems to indicate that the wound that took Christopher Dorner's life was self-inflicted.\nKAYE: The ordeal was over. But as the smoke cleared, questions lingered whether the police set the cabin ablaze on purpose.\nBROOKS: I've been talking to some of my former colleagues who are still active in law enforcement, and we're all wondering, why did they throw burners into an occupied building? Were they doing it to drive him out? Were they doing it to burn the house down around him? We don't know. These are all questions that need to be asked.\nMCMAHON: I can tell that you that it was not on purpose. We did not",
        "baseline": " intentionally burn down that cabin to get Mr. Dorner out. The tear gas canisters that we used does generate a lot of heat. We introduced those canisters into the residence, and a fire erupted.\nKAYE: There are also questions about why authorities couldn't find Dorner when he had been hiding right under their noses. The cabin where he was holed up was just across the street from one sheriff's command center, and only two miles from another.\nAs the showdown ended, there were no celebrations as thoughts turned to grieving families.\nREGINA CRAIN, WIFE OF SLAIN POLICE OFFICER MICHAEL CRAIN: A lot of people loved Mike. And I knew I would have support no matter what. But I really did not realize the sheer scale of this, and how many people are touched by his life.\nKAYE: Sadness that four lives were taken.

When he played Harry Lime in The Third Man, he came up with the “cuckoo clock” speech his character gives at an amusement park, arguably the most memorable scene in the movie. And when Universal hired him to direct a potboiler, he spun straw into gold with Touch of Evil, a stylish indictment of racism and police brutality in a border town that is even more timely today.\nTouch of Evil is illustrative of how Welles could be his own worst enemy. It was his last chance to direct for a studio. He had to do it for free. Universal thought so little of him, they only paid him for playing the role of the corrupt top cop, Quinlan. Nevertheless, if he behaved himself, Hollywood might welcome him back.\nBut like the",

While one can applaud Welles for insulting studio executives (what else is a suit for?), there is no excuse for leaving the editing of the film in someone else’s hands while pursuing other projects. The same thing happened with The Magnificent Ambersons, Callow informs us, to disastrous effect.\nAt heart, Welles was an independent filmmaker, the granddaddy of them all, perhaps. He preferred chaos and freedom to the security and conformity of the studio system. Usually this required him to demean himself to raise money. “Lower than this I cannot stoop,” he moaned, after agreeing to introduce a cheap pulp radio program.\nOh yes, he can.

Simple as that,\" Adm. Harry Harris told the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nHarris said tensions with China are escalating as Beijing moves ahead with military deployments on new islands in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway through which some $5.3 trillion in global trade passes annually.\nIsland building was completed in July, Harris said, and now the Chinese are in the process of militarization, something China's leader Xi Jinping said in September would not take place.\n\"China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea and you'd have to believe in the flat Earth to think otherwise,\" Harris said. \"China's surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island, the new radars on the Cuarteron Reef, the 10,000-foot runway on Subi Reef over here and on Fiery Cross Reef and other places, these are actions that are changing in my opinion the operational landscape in the South China Sea.\"\nAs a response, Harris called for expanding US warship patrols to include international naval forces in the sea to counter the Chinese encroachment.\n\"We should continue to exercise our rights on the high seas and in the airspace above it,\" he said. \"And we should encourage our friends, partners and allies to do the same,\" Harris said.\nUS Secretary of Defense Ash Carter (R) speaks with US Navy Cmdr. Robert C. Francis Jr., as Carter and Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein (Not Pictured) visited the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, in this handout photograph taken and released on November 5, 2015.\nChina also has been sailing warships and flying military aircraft near Japan's Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Harris said the United States has said it would defend those islands, which China claims, as \"we would defend Tokyo\" under a US-Japan defense treaty.\nSeparately, the commander of US Forces Korea, Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, testified at the hearing that the threat from North Korea is increasing and efforts by China to rein in the rogue state's nuclear and missile programs have failed.\nChina has \"underestimated the danger of [North Korean leader Kim Jong Un] at this point and he is clearly confident in his ability to provoke and control the situation,\" Scaparrotti said. \"I would encourage them to reconsider that at this time but obviously they still, despite these recent events, appear to be reluctant to take some serious steps which they certainly could.\"\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects a flight drill of fighter pilots from the Korean People's Army's (KPA) Air and Anti-Air Force, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on February 21, 2016.\nChina provides most of North Korea's fuel oil but fears instability on its border if it pressures the Kim regime, the four-star general said.\nScaparrotti said tensions in Korea have never been higher. \"If deterrence fails, full-scale conflict in Korea would more closely parallel the high intensity combat of the Korean War than the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he said, adding that any conflict will significantly increase the use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\nHarris said North Korea has nuclear weapons, but also that he is not convinced the underground nuclear test carried out in January involved a new and larger hydrogen bomb.\n\"I think they've posed a very distinct and real threat, not only to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula but globally,\" Harris said of the North Koreans.\n\"They're on a quest for nuclear weapons and a means to militarize them and the means to deliver them intercontinentally; they pose a real threat to Hawaii and to the West Coast of the mainland United States and soon to the entire US\"\nScaparrotti said the flight test Feb. 7 was a Taepodong-2 missile, not a space launch as Pyongyang claims.\nNorth Korea is close to deploying new road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\nOn China, Harris warned that its long-range missiles threaten US ships and forces in the Pacific and urged building new missiles and weapons to counter them.\n\"Today, China is 'out-sticking' US air and maritime forces in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region in terms of ranges of anti-ship weapons,\" Harris said in a prepared statement. \"I need increased lethality, specifically ships and aircraft equipped with faster, more lethal, and more survivable weapons systems. We must have longer range offensive weapons on every platform.\"\nThe threat of weapons designed to push US forces out of the region is \"significant\" and \"pacing the threat is not an option in my playbook,\" Harris said.\nThe DF-21D \"carrier killer\" missile rolls through China's 2015 military parade.\n\"We must outpace the competition which requires continued investment in development and deployment of the latest technology to USPACOM,\" he said, using the acronym for the US Pacific Command.\nHarris said the Pacific Command has a shortage of weapons. \"Critical munitions shortfalls are a top priority and concern,\" he said.\nThe commander wants additional and improved weapons to deter and defeat aggression. Pacific forces need long-range and standoff strike weapons, longer-range anti-ship weapons, advanced air-to-air munitions, theater ballistic and cruise missile defenses, and cluster bombs.\n\"When I started flying P-3s back in the late '70s, we had the Harpoon missile,\" Harris said. \"And that's the same missile we have today, and we need to have an increased lethality and reach and speed.\"\nChina has developed supersonic anti-ship missiles and land-based weapons that can range further, hit harder and fly faster than the Harpoon, he said, urging the rapid deployment of a new long-range anti-ship missile.\nMilitary vehicles carrying DF-15B short-range ballistic missiles drive past the Tiananmen Gate during a military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in Beijing, China, September 3, 2015.\nFunding for the advanced missiles and additional F-35 fighters was included in the pending defense budget for fiscal year 2017.\nBallistic and cruise missile defense enhancements are needed to protect the US homeland and key regional sites, Harris said.\nBeneath the water, Harris called for modernizing and improving US torpedoes and naval mines to maintain submarine warfare advantages.\nHe added that additional submarines are needed in the Pacific.\n\"My requirement for submarines is not met but that's our principle asymmetric advantage over China and any other adversary, and I think we have kept after it,\" Harris said.\nA new US ballistic missile submarine and long-range strike bomber, which is under development, also are needed for Asia, he said.\nConcept art of the proposed Long Range Strike Bomber.\nThe Chinese military threat is not limited to conventional forces. It includes Beijing's nuclear buildup, which includes four nuclear missile equipped Jin-class submarines now deployed that can strike the United States, Harris said.\n\"These are submarines that we have to, we must keep them at risk, whenever they are underway and on patrol,\" he said.\nBoth Scaparrotti and Harris said they favored the deployment of advanced US missile defenses in South Korea, despite Chinese opposition.\nHarris criticized the Chinese for opposing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, that was requested by Scaparrotti in 2014 but held up by the South Koreans because of Chinese opposition.\n\"I find it preposterous that China would try to wedge",
        "baseline": " itself between South Korea and the United States for a missile defense system designed to defend Americans and Koreans on the peninsula,\" Harris said.\nCommittee Chairman Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said the Obama administration strategy toward Asia has not stopped China from bullying regional neighbors or militarizing the South China Sea through deployment of HQ-9 anti-aircraft missiles and a new radar.\n\"Despite US efforts to rebalance to the Asia Pacific, US policy has failed to adapt to the scale and velocity of the challenge we face,\" McCain said.\nChina's rapid military buildup and expansion is making it more difficult for the United States to defend allies from military aggression.nav\"Simply put, the administration's policy has failed,\" the senator said.\n\"Beijing has been willing to accept a high level of risk to achieve its strategic goals. Meanwhile, the White House's risk aversion has resulted in an indecisive and inadequate policy that has confused and alarmed our regional allies and partners.\"",

Others thought a bad storm had felled the vessel. Others contended a mutiny had erupted, and the men made off with the ship’s booty. But despite such interest, explorers have not gotten any closer to the truth. The mystery of what some have dubbed the “holy grail” of Great Lakes shipwrecks has persisted.\nThat may have now changed. On a spring day in 2011, two Michigan treasure hunters named Kevin Dykstra and Fred Monroe from Muskegon were out on an “old fiberglass boat that wasn’t too leaky” looking for treasure. They were hunting for box cars. In the late 1800s, ferries carried box cars across the lake and one of them was rumored to have fallen into the water. In it, the stories went, was more than $2 million worth of Confederate gold coins. So as the men tra",

So over the next few years, Dykstra consulted with a number of experts about the prospective find before he decided to alert the public. “When we went public, we know it would be a popular story, but we didn’t think this many people would be interested in it.” For that reason, he said, they haven’t revealed the exact location of the find, citing concerns someone would set sail for that location to plunder the wreckage.",

        "prompt": "Sylvain Cote was in the frozen-food aisle of his local grocery store when the ground shook. Harder. Faster. He’d experienced smaller tremors twice before, but nothing of this magnitude. Once the building swayed from side to side, he knew it was a big one. He leaned against a column under a metal beam near the meat counter and waited.\n“The longest 45 seconds of my life,” he says.\nOn Jan. 12, 2010, just before 5 p.m., an earthquake registering 7.0 on the Richter Scale rocked Haiti, killing 300,000 and injuring countless more. Its epicenter was about 16 miles southwest of the capital in Port-au-Prince, not far from where Cote lived.\nCote climbed over debris and crawled out of Olympic Market into a cloud of dust from fallen structures. It took him over four hours to drive five miles. He found his home standing, and his wife and then-3-year-old daughter unharmed. Not everyone was so lucky. More than one million people were left homeless, bringing more suffering to a nation that is already the hemisphere’s poorest and most disaster-prone. The earthquake was the worst in the region in more than 200 years.\nFearing more falling buildings, thousands of people streamed onto the fairways of Petion-Ville Tennis and Golf Club, which sits in a hillside commercial zone. In a matter of days, more than 55,000 people occupied the private nine-hole course, where Cote is a member, and converted it into the country’s largest “canvas village” of tents. The homeless improvised, grabbing whatever they could find—bed sheets, tarps, tires, plywood, sheet metal—as a means of shelter, and lined up to pay the equivalent of eight cents for a bucket of water.\nFor three years the course was home to 55,000 refugees displaced by the earthquake.\nCote had originally moved to Haiti in 1998 from his native Canada for a short-term business project. The work became full-time, and before long he had a regular game—and caddie—at Petion-Ville, which is the second-oldest golf club in the Caribbean, dating to 1934. The earthquake was felt across the border in the Dominican Republic, where courses like Casa de Campo and Punta Cana attract players from all over the world. Petion-Ville, conversely, is Haiti’s only place to play.\nThe roughly 300 members of Petion-Ville realized it would be impossible—not to mention inhumane—to evict all the displaced people. “We had never seen such despair,” Cote says. For several years, the club’s 56 acres would serve the greater good. The pool was drained, and the eight tennis courts functioned as a warehouse for food, water and medical supplies. Actor and activist Sean Penn, through his nonprofit, J/P Haitian Relief Organization, brought a semblance of order. Penn’s temporary office was next to the ninth green, not far from a makeshift pharmacy. Church services were held under a blue-and-white-stripe circus tent on No. 4. An elementary school formed at the fifth, and along what was the second fairway formed a temporary hospital, bank, barber shop and a nail salon.\nThoughts of resuming normal club activity started to flicker in 2013. With support of the International Organization for Migration and Haitian authorities, internally displaced people were given a $500 relocation stipend and a roof over their head. It took 18 months to move every family and dismantle the camp.\nThe golf course was left in ruin. The club’s board of directors decided not to rebuild it. Too onerous a task, they said.\nCote refused to watch golf in the country die. He organized a skeleton crew of a dozen caddies and former course workers to rebuild the course by hand, one hole at a time.\nSylvain Cote with three caddies who helped rebuild Petion-Ville's Golf Course by hand.\nThe process began by collecting and burning trash and trucking away piles of discarded metal and rubber. Every Saturday for more than three years, Cote arrived at the course at 8 a.m. and doled out assignments. When the rest of the workers saw him pick up a shovel and fill a wheelbarrow, they knew he was serious. “It was our project,” Cote says. “The guys were so dedicated and proud to contribute to restoring golf. They did the hard work—I was just leading them.” On weekdays, while Cote was at work, the longtime caddiemaster supervised and followed Cote’s instructions.\nThey started at the ninth hole, which sits atop a plateau closest to the clubhouse. Two feet of gravel covered the fairway, which had served as a parking lot. They used a backhoe, their only piece of machinery, to scrape away the rocks and remove piping that had transported water, as well as three large cement blocks that had held lampposts. This hole alone took nearly a year to complete.\nRather than re-create the layout, Cote let out the shaft on his imagination. Having lost some land at the former first and second holes, Cote erected a double green. Another green was seeded with bentgrass purchased at a Miami hardware store. Otherwise, they transplanted native grass. All told, they added four new tee boxes, including a stone wall at the ninth and a bunker guarding the green at the finishing hole. Par is 64. Cote’s best round, now age 50, is 66.\nCote and his crew breathed new life into the Caribbean tradition of “island time.” There was never a timetable for completion, rather faith in a perpetual forecast of sunny days to work. In the three years it took to repair the course, Cote kept his guys motivated with the promise of a steady paycheck, and the possible return of their former jobs. He invested $30,000 of his money and raised another $10,000 from other supporters. In addition to getting back a place to play golf, he saw rehabilitating",
        "baseline": " the course as something of a social experiment that bonded a group of men in a common purpose.\n“The project kept me going and gave me a reason to stay in Haiti,” he says. The club is once again the social hub of his life. “The members and staff are like a big family,” Cote says.

It has also lost ground against the euro and some Asian peers, raising concerns that Japan may be engaged in a race to the bottom to promote exports.\nThe yen weakened further Monday on news of Kuroda's likely nomination, falling to 94.3 against the U.S. dollar. The Nikkei, meanwhile, gained 2% in early trading.\nWeak currency cheapens the price of a country's exports, making them more attractive to international buyers by undercutting competitors. Japan's exporters have cheered the yen's decline, and Abe's popularity has skyrocketed in recent weeks.\nKuroda appears willing to follow through on Abe's policies, telling the Wall Street Journal earlier this month that Japan has \"plenty of room for monetary easing.\"\n\"If necessary and if appropriate, of course additional monetary easing this year could be justified,\" he said.\nMasaaki Shirakawa, the current BoJ head, has announced he will stand down on March 19, several weeks before his term was due to end. The official nomination of Kuroda, along with two deputies, is expected later this week.\nShirakawa agreed last month to double the bank's inflation target and adopt open-ended purchases of government bonds but is opposed to some of the more extreme proposals considered by the bank and has been accused of doing too little, too late.\nBy way of contrast, Kuroda told the Journal that the Bo",

You have to achieve the target within a reasonably short time period,\" he said.\nThe political pressure on the Bank of Japan has caused consternation in the international community, with some lobbing charges of currency manipulation in Japan's direction.\nTokyo has rejected those claims, saying its policies are aimed at the economy not the yen, but the G7 group of leading industrial nations - including Japan - felt compelled to issue a rare statement earlier this month aimed at cooling talk of a currency war.\nKuroda, for one, seems undeterred, telling the Journal that the yen's weakening is good for the global economy.\n\"From a global point of view, is it good for the Japanese economy to continue to suffer from deflation...and low growth?\" he asked. \"That is not good for Japan, not good for the world economy.\"",

The refit program did not include ongoing maintenance on the vessels.\n“That’s our existing work and takes care of about 300 jobs at the shipyard — that’s by no means a small amount of work. If we lose that work we’ll lose jobs out of Halifax, plain and simple,” he said.\nIrving currently has a workforce of about 1,100, which sustains both maintenance and work building six Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships (AOPS), but that’s expected to grow in the coming years as ws work gets underway for the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) ships. Both the patrol ships and the new frigates, which will eventually replace the Halifax class, are part of a massive, multi-billion dollar primary contract awarded to Irving back in 2011 under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS). Maintenance on the new vessels or current fleet is not part of that contract.\nThe delay between the completion of the AOPS construction and start of the CSC build has long been a cause for concern for Irving, which has made it clear that any major gap between the two will result in layoffs unless there is work to sustain the large workforce. And with repeated delays in awarding the CSC contract, that gap is looking more and more likely.\nUnifor members rally on the Grand Parade steps in support of the Ships Stay Here campaign on Oct. 16, 2018.\nJohnston said any layoffs will hit new employees first, as per union seniority rules, many of whom were hired under programs targeted at women and minorities.\nOn Tuesday, about 250 Irving Shipbuilding workers used their lunch break to march from the shipyard to the Grand Parade in Halifax to raise awareness of their campaign to keep jobs in the Nova Scotia capital.\n“I came to the shipyard with the thoughts that I’d be working at the shipyards for the remainder of my life,” said Antonia Wareham, an African Nova Scotian woman who has been working for the yard for about a year and a half.\nWhile Unifor officials say the shipyard workforce counts on maintenance, it’s worth noting there’s no official contract with the government that requires the work to stay there.\n“If the government is thinking of changing the sourcing for periodic maintenance work for the Halifax",

        "prompt": "THE FEAR OF FEAR ITSELF. Terrorism, so often sponsored by nations and magnified by the media, plants seeds of fear throughout the world. And fear can imprison free men and women more surely than the stoutest walls.\nWHEN ``The Color Purple'' went to the Cannes Film Festival in France this month, director Steven Spielberg and star Whoopi Goldberg stayed home. The Italian Open tennis tournament began yesterday in Rome, but there were no junior players from the United States: The US Tennis Association had decided not to send any.\nA trade delegation from the state of Washington canceled a European trip just days before it was to have begun.\nTWA is closing down its Cairo-Athens and Cairo-Rome connections; Pan Am has laid off 212 employees and canceled new services planned for the Chicago-Frankfurt and Los Angeles-Paris routes; and US travel agents are reporting 20 to 30 percent declines in trips to Europe.\nThe reason in each case: fear of terrorism.\nIn the past year, terrorism has made its mark on America as never before. A relatively small number of committed terrorists, operating thousands of miles from America's borders, have succeeded in changing the way the most influential nation on earth lives, works, and relaxes.\nThe present upsurge in concern began, perhaps, with the 17-day ordeal of TWA's Flight 847 in the Middle East last summer. Watching the hijacking unfold in lurid detail on network television, ordinary Americans were reminded once again how much they, too, were susceptible to terrorism.\nAmericans had seen plenty of terrorism before, of course. But much of it had been directed at government officials and other obvious targets. The takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran, in 1979, although of much longer duration than the TWA incident, involved diplomats, not ordinary folks. The truck-bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, though far more lethal, involved uniformed servicemen.\nBut TWA 847 seemed different. Ordinary Americans from places such as Indianapolis, Little Rock, Ark., and Albuquerque, N.M., became hostages. The terrorists, given plenty of television air time, explained their deadly purpose with new force.\nSo the nation was already primed with concern when, in October, New York passenger Leon Klinghoffer was brutally murdered by the Palestinian hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. The spiral of fright rose another notch when, in December, five Americans perished in the wanton massacres by Palestinian gunmen at the Rome and Vienna airports.\nCould not something be done? Must the Western world stand by helplessly while trained terrorists strike out at will against innocent people?\nThe occasion for response came after a discoth`eque frequented by US soldiers in West Berlin was bombed April 5. US intelligence traced the cause to Libyan agents in East Berlin. On April 14, US planes bombed Libya.\nNever before in the Western world's two-decade-long battle against modern terrorism had military force been directed against a government. Terrorism had moved into the big leagues.\nHistorians will long debate the wisdom of the Reagan administration's decision to send in the bombers.\nWill the strike help limit terrorism, by sending messages that states supporting terrorist groups cannot escape without penalty? Or will it provoke new fury and new attacks on Americans?\nWill the attack drive wedges between America and friendly nations, or will the unified stand against terrorism articulated at the recent Tokyo summit prove to be a bellwether for tougher stands in general?\nIs terrorism best fought with military force? Or does it take better police work, tougher security, and more preventive intelligence?\nShould Americans seek to emulate the successes of the British and the Italians, who have managed to diminish the incidents of Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Red Brigades terrorism by strict adherence to the law? Or is the world now fighting a new kind of terrorism -- masterminded by puppeteers controlling suicidal operatives and sweeping across international borders -- that demands a new kind of response?\nFinally, can terrorism be fought without altering the fabric of free democracies? Or must protection of liberty involve curtailment of individual freedoms? These questions have been the subject of scores of Monitor interviews conducted over the past five months in London, Belfast, and Aberdeen; Bonn, Cologne, Bremen, and Hamburg; Paris, Milan, and Rome; Tel Aviv and Jerusalem; and Washington and Boston.\nTerrorism's central weapon is fear itself. It consists of an attempt by the weak to gain dominion over the strong. And since its ultimate target is not the victim but the public at large, terrorists seek access to formal or informal channels of communication.\nTerrorism stems from some of the basest elements of human nature -- hatred, revenge, and territoriality. Yet it often comes in the guise of religious or political movements, a just attempt to gain a homeland or a remedy for past injustices.\nIt is essentially a problem affecting the free world, not the communist bloc. The US State Department conservatively counts 695 terrorist incidents worldwide in 1985. Only one took place in Eastern Europe. And although only four occurred in North America, American targets overseas were involved in about 25 percent of all terrorism. Of the 695 total, the vast majority took place in the Middle East (310), Europe (184), and Latin America (125).\nTerroists are building new alliances. Isolated groups are beginning to come together in what John Newhouse, a New Yorker writer, has dubbed ``a freemasonry of terrorism.'' A meeting in Tripoli in early February at which Libya's Col. Muammar Qadaffi was host brought together 22 Arab terrorist groups. An unrelated meeting, in Frankfurt, West Germany, from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2, brought together several hundred participants from 11 European countries to discuss ``anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist resistance in Western Europe'' and to review strategy with ``comrades'' from the Middle East and Central America.\nTerrorists are shifting to a new target: the tourist. Robert Kupperman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., notes that ``the real story in terrorism [these days] is the tourism business.'' In the 1970s, embassies and military installations were frequently attacked. These targets, subsequently ``hardened,'' may soon become even more secure: The US State Department is proposing to spend $4.4 billion to build 79 new embassies and renovate 175 others. A second source of targets, the international business community, has also hardened itself: A Rand Corporation terrorism expert, Brian M. Jenkins, notes that businesses in America spend $21 billion a year on security. So terrorists, seeking softer targets, increasingly look to tourists. Estimates are that countries around the Mediterranean lost $1 billion in canceled bookings in 1985, with Greece alone losing $300 million.\nMuch of modern terrorism is tied to the Arab-Israeli conflict -- involving two cultures whose dominant religious teachings both make room for revenge. But many observers agree that the solution to terrorism does not lie simply in resolving the Palestinian problem. Even if that problem were solved tomorrow, they say, Middle Eastern terrorism would continue at the hands of militant Shiite fundamentalists. Terrorism would also",
        "baseline": " continue from other groups: Sikhs, Tamils, Basques, Irish Republicans, the Boricua Popular Army in Puerto Rico, the Red Army Faction in West Germany, and the M-19 in Colombia, to name a few.\nThe Rand Corporation's Mr. Jenkins cites new sources of frustration and new levels of state sponsorship as reasons for the rise in terrorism. He also notes a widening arena: By the mid-1980s, terrorist incidents were occurring, on average, in 65 countries each year -- up from 29 countries in the late 1960s.\nMost experts agree there is plenty of room for strong counterterrorist measures. Noting that terrorism is most effective when the public lets fear take over, many observers urge that it be kept in perspective -- noting, for example, that the 23 American lives lost overseas last year in terrorist incidents are greatly overshadowed by the 18,000 murders in the US each year.\nUSA Update Why is Dylann Roof not facing charges of terrorism?",

        "prompt": "Facebook’s latest diversity report is a lot more of the same, with the exception of two components: LGBTQA employee representation and hiring data from the last 12 months. Facebook also announced a $15 million investment in Code.org to help the non-profit organization develop computer science curriculum among underrepresented student populations.\nHere are the high-level stats. Facebook is 52% white in the U.S., compared to 55% white last year. That should be good news, but it’s more so bittersweet because there was no increase in the two most underrepresented groups at Facebook: black and Hispanic. Facebook’s employee population in the U.S. is still only 2% black, 4% Hispanic, 1% other and 3% two or more races. There was, however, an increase in Facebook’s Asian population, which went up from 36% to 38% this year. Globally, Facebook employs slightly fewer men. As of June 2016, Facebook is 67% male compared to 68% male last year.\nFor the first time, Facebook disclosed data around sexual orientation and gender identity via the results of a voluntary survey. Of the 61% of employees who responded, 7% identified as LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or asexual).\nAlthough these numbers make it seem like not much has changed, 9% of Facebook’s new hires over the last year in senior leadership roles were black, 5% were Hispanic and 29% were women. The hiring rates of blacks, Hispanics and women exceed their current respective representation at Facebook.\n“What we’re starting to see is that our hiring trend is going in a positive direction,” Williams said.\nFacebook, of course, cites the pipeline as a problem for the reason why there are not more hires from underrepresented groups. Williams pointed to how only one in four high schools teach computer science and in nine states, zero black people took the Advanced Placement Computer Science test last year.\nThat’s why Facebook has committed $15 million to Code.org over the next five years to focus particularly on underrepresented people. The hope is that investing in Code.org will help to beef up the pipeline of underrepresented students moving",

Williams and I chatted about the news of the last couple of weeks and how systemic racism plays into Facebook’s overall diversity and inclusion strategy.\nNoting how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited San Quentin last year to see first-hand what the conditions are like, Williams went on to say that Facebook has been “interested in the racism — the web of racism that researchers like Michelle Alexander (author of The New Jim Crow) have exposed that may underlie the system that makes it so people are disproportionately negatively affected — black and brown people.",

It's unclear whether he'll face any charges, but the agreement he signed with a Manhattan court is distinctly not an admission of guilt, reports Forbes's William T. Barrett.\nBarrett broke the story on April 3 in a pun-filled post about how Condé Nast had been taken for a ride in a \"spear-phishing\" scam. (Unlike regular old phishing attacks, which use mass email requests for sensitive information like bank passwords, spear-phishing targets specific people, usually under the guise of someone they already know.)

A panicked Condé Nast quickly contacted federal authorities. They found $7.92 million–nearly the full amount wired–sitting in two accounts at the BBVA Compass Bank branch in Alvin. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan got a court order to seize the money, following that up with the civil forfeiture lawsuit alleging wire fraud that formed the basis for the Forbes story.\nSurface this week signed a waiver giving up the money, so it's destined for a return to Condé Nast.

The province also held 16 sessions with stakeholder groups and reached out to fisheries and agriculture groups, First Nations and others who play a role in what happens on our coasts.\nNova Scotia has more than 8,000 kilometres of coastline, jumping to 13,000 kilometres when the land around harbours, coves, inlets and tidal estuaries is included. The sea that buffets our coastline is expected to rise in the range of a metre by 2100.\nThe legislation is based on preserving the dynamic nature of the coast in order to allow for natural changes to coastal ecosystems that provide fish, wildlife and plant habitat.\nThe bill takes into consideration that human-made structures like rock barriers designed to delay or obstruct the natural migration and shifting of coastal features and salt marshes may accelerate the effects of erosion, including the erosion of adjacent properties that do not contain barriers.\nThe legislation also acknowledges that coastal features such as beaches, dune systems, barrier beaches, coastal lagoons, coastal wetlands and salt marshes are valuable habitat and help provide for the health and well-being of Nova Scotians.\nThe coastal protection legislation addresses the significant threat to the safety of Nova Scotians from sea-level rise, coastal flooding, storm surges and erosion, taking into account the integral link between economic prosperity and environmental issues.\nMuch of the legislation detail will be hammered out in pending regulations, including the setback of new construction from the coast.\n“That will be determined in regulations,” said Adele Poirier, a spokeswoman with the Environment Department. Existing structures will not be affected by the new legislation.\nThe department will work with municipalities and other stakeholders to develop the regulations.\nNancy Anningson, coastal adaption co-ordinator with the Ecology Action Centre, has worked with government in identifying key elements for the legislation.\n“This legislation is a crucial step toward protecting our coastal ecosystems by preventing future inappropriate coastal development,” Anningson said in a release, adding that protecting the coastline will allow it to adapt and remain resilient.\nLike the coastal protection legislation, the NDP bill, too, fell short on specifics.\nThe green jobs initiative would create a committee of experts to develop an economic mobilization plan to move Nova Scotia to a prosperous clean economy by 2050. The plan would create thousands of well-paid jobs and training opportunities, make homes and communities more livable and affordable and advance social justice and economic fairness.\n“Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is possible, the experts",
        "baseline": " tell us so,” Lenore Zann, the NDP representative for the Truro-Bible Hill area, said of the urging from a United Nations-based climate change panel last year for necessary action on global warming in the next dozen years.\nBut it can lead by example, Zann said.\nThe NDP bill says 4,200 jobs will be created in the province by making homes and offices more efficient and points to the estimate that every dollar spent on energy programs generates $7 of gross domestic product.\nThe NDP plan would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050. Kate Ervine, a professor at Saint Mary’s University and the author of the book, Carbon, said a shift to a zero-carbon world would create economic opportunities.\nStill, the green jobs plan did not come with a specific price tag.\n“We’re talking about shared prosperity,” Ervine said.",
        "llm_baseline": "say,but that will require a massive transformation of our people and a massive transformation of our economy,“said NDP Leader Gary McKay.“We need to get to work now to make that happen.“The NDP bill would also create a green jobs fund to support the development of the green jobs movement.The fund would be financed through a carbon tax,which the NDP has said will be introduced by 2020.The NDP bill would also create a green jobs commissioner to oversee the implementation of the plan.The NDP bill would also create a green jobs commissioner to oversee the implementation of the plan.The NDP bill would also create a green jobs commissioner to oversee the implementation of the plan.The NDP bill would also create a green jobs commissioner to oversee the implementation of the plan.The NDP bill would also create a green jobs commissioner to oversee the implementation of the",

        "prompt": "The conditions of some people living with sickle cell as a result of complications from the disorder actually qualify as disabilities. There are so many instances to cite: Avascular Necrosis is a damage to the shoulders or hips, which causes constant pain, stiffness, limited joint function, restricted movement and may cripple the affected part of the body.\nWhen this occurs, it becomes a disability. I know a few SCD warriors, who are crippled in the leg(s) as a result of AVN.\nHearing loss or partial deafness is another complication of SCD suffered by some warriors. It is a disability because it interferes with everyday life as a result inability to hear clearly. I’m a victim and it is a hidden disability.\nHowever, we are not looking at pushing to make SCD to be recognised by law as a disability but looking at broadening the scope of the Disability bill when it is passed into law in Nigeria to cover Sickle Cell warriors, who are incapable of leading a productive life as a result of the condition or those, who have other complications as a result of Sickle Cell.\nThe benefits for Sickle Cell victims under any disability law are enormous. I’m aware that in some countries in Europe and America, they have social disability laws and Sickle Cell victims with disabilities are entitled to the benefits under these laws.\nLagos State has a department for disability known as Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs. I’m a member and the body is funded with about N500m for persons living with disabilities. Assistive devices such as wheelchairs, crutches, eye glasses, trainings, are all offered to persons with special needs in the state for free. These are some of the benefits to be derived from the disability laws or initiatives, which is applicable to victims of SCD too, who may be disabled and reside in the state.\nA lot of Sickle Cell patients have other complications that develop as a result of the condition and this in turn affects their daily lives, in terms of long-term care.\nPeople don’t necessarily have to be physically challenged to be disabled and qualify for benefits from disability laws or projects. Hearing loss is a hidden challenge. It isn’t obvious to onlookers. There are warriors that are badly hit by SCD that they are regularly pale, weak and can’t undergo any physical exertion, let alone work or hold down a job. What is better defined as a disability than this type of incapacitation?\nMeaning of disability – if you have a physical or mental impairment that limits a person’s movements, senses or activities that has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect on your ability to do normal daily activities.\nOur organisation spearheaded the fundraising campaign for a three-year SCD warrior, who had a crisis that resulted in a stroke. It isn’t the first or second case that we have been involved in. It is just the major one that comes after we officially got registered as an organisation.\nFundraising for causes isn’t a walk in the park in this part of the world. Hence, we were joyous and humbled by the amount raised, which was above N500,000 through kind-hearted donors, who responded to our campaign to save the boy’s life.\nRegarding spontaneity of giving by Nigerians, from my observation, it is a two- way thing. We, as a people, are supportive of one another. On the other side, there’s an apathy to supporting or donating to causes. This is largely due to trust issues due to the activities of fraudulent people, making it sometimes difficult for those, who are genuinely spirited for touching lives.\nYam is grown throughout Africa and Nigeria is the world’s most prolific producer, supplying 70 per cent to the world market.\nYams contain vitamin C and other minerals that work as anti-oxidants and help with the production of red blood cells. All these qualities improve the immune system and keeps one healthy.\nThe vitamin A in yams has other functions, such as maintaining healthy mucous members and skin, heightening night vision, supporting healthy bone development and it transforms to beta-carotene when eaten.\nYams are a good source of vitamin C, fighting infections such as cold, malaria and strong bones and healthy immune function.\nYams are good for your eyes; they help by lowering the risk of retinal detachment. They are rich in carbohydrates and have a lot of fibre and hence gives a lot of energy.\nYams are rich in potassium, they are great for brain nerve activity, support optimal cell, body fluids and they help promote better cognitive functioning.\nOther minerals found in yams are Metabolic B vitamins, which are great for keeping the blood vessels healthy. The content of vitamin B6 is good for shrinking the effects of hom",

Copper (which produces healthy red blood cells), Calcium, Manganese (a component in the super-potent antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase), and phosphorus which are body-beneficial minerals found in yams.\nEating yams promotes cardiovascular health by getting rid of excess sodium in our bloodstreams. Most importantly, yams fight against anaemia with its high iron content.

The network, called e-Choupal, was set up by diversified company ITC to aid its procurement of produce for its agriculture products business.The Web site will help employers who are planning to expand their operations in rural areas, besides providing opportunities in urban markets for rural people, Sanjay Modi, managing director of Monster India, said on Tuesday.The tie-up with ITC gives Monster access to about 40,000 villages in nine Indian states. Potentially 1 million job seekers could reside in these villages, Modi said.ITC e-Choupal is expanding quickly, and is connecting three to four new villages every month, Modi said. This provides Monster an opportunity to continue expanding in rural markets, he added.Sanchalaks, the farmers who manage the e-Choupal kiosk for farming communities, are now being trained to help young people submit resumes online, apply for jobs and explore other career opportunities. There are lots of employment sites, but villagers lack access to the Internet, Modi said.

        "prompt": "THE DARK, claustrophobic streets running off the Royal Mile lead away from the light and downhill into the shadows. These half-forgotten reminders of Edinburgh’s insanitary past provide a perfect setting for a suitably spooky atmosphere. Largely built upon the ruins of centuries gone by, it is not just those of a sensitive nature who feel a certain frisson when they walk past.\nAdmitting to a spine-chilling creepiness is one thing, but deciding that you believe in ghosts is quite another.There are few places better situated to debating paranormal phenomena than Mary King's Close, Edinburgh's notoriously haunted spot below the City Chambers. The close was inhabited during the 16th and 17th centuries before the plague ravaged families living in the tightly packed tenement buildings. A century after the illness broke out, the city partly sealed the abandoned homes and alleyways, prompting chilling stories about paranormal sightings of previous inhabitants.\nThe celebrity of the close's supernatural resident is Annie, a ghostly pre-teen who (so the story goes) scared the daylights out of a Japanese psychic in 1992. This lady had been unimpressed by the tour until she arrived at one of the many small rooms. There she was suddenly struck by an overwhelming feeling of sickness, hunger and cold and, when she tried to leave felt the ghastly tug of a ghostly hand on her leg.\nPoor Annie's spectral life has now been fleshed out and it is believed that she had been left to die by her family. Since then, people from round the world have come to \"Annie’s room\". Many have told tour guides of seeing impressions of the spirit in the room; some visitors, treating the room as a shrine, have left gifts for the little girl out of affection.\nSceptic, open-minded or believer, the tour itself is a wonderful experience and well orchestrated by the operators, Continuum. Authentically dressed guides lead visitors out of the sunshine downstairs into the murky past through vaults and alleyways that form the remnants of 17th-century Edinburgh. They punctuate the gloom with eye-opening and historical information, practised banter and the occasional heart-thumping shock. The uncharacteristic drop in temperature in Annie's room is disconcerting.A growing list of people who believe they've seen spirits here has led to a number of experiments being conducted in the close. Ryan O'Neill from Scottish Paranormal, a group of amateur enthusiasts of the supernatural, captured \"very faint white or transparent spheres\" when photographing the recreated workshop. His group hopes to find these \"spiritual orbs\" again when they conduct experiments during the Edinburgh Ghost festival, 13-22 May.\nThe team use scientific equipment to measure electromagnetic fluctuations of temperatures and record anything odd. However, they don't confine themselves to hard science when investigating the phenomena, but use psychics and mediums to see whether their experiences tally with the scientific findings. They are also keen to involve members of the public in their investigations.\n\"I want to get their feelings and sensations,\" says O’Neill. \"I want them to see what it is we do and to see there is a scientific side to our work.\"\nThe close is not short of scientists looking into paranormal activity. In April 2001 Dr Richard Wiseman of Hertfordshire University invited the public to join him for a series of experiments. Wiseman is returning for the festival, this time with scientists in tow to conduct another",

She says that 40 per cent or more of people participating in the previous experiment reported having experiences. Luckily Watt doesn’t have to rely on the public to describe what they saw, as she had her own experience of ghosts in Mary King's Close during a previous experiment.\n\"I was in a part of the close where no one else was supposed to be,\" she says. \"I heard footsteps and the sound of rustling clothing. From a professional point of view I was annoyed because I thought it was someone intruding on our experiment, but when I asked the tour guides I found out there was no one there.\"\nWhich does rather beg the question, just who was intruding on whom in the darkness of Mary King's Close?",

Siepler went two for three with two doubles and four runs batted in against the Knights, pacing top-seeded La Cañada to an 8-1 victory.\nIt was a turnaround game for Siepler, after going one for eight in the first two rounds of the playoffs.\n\"It's nice to have her back swinging the bat that way,\" La Cañada Coach KC Matthews said. \"That's the Megan Siepler that we all know and love.\"\nKatella (20-8) of Anaheim got on the board quickly with a run in the first inning. Erika Garcia started the Knights one-out rally by reaching first base on an error committed by the La Cañada third baseman. Melissa Zuniga doubled to put runners at second and third and Melissa Biddle hit a single that landed just over the heads of Thomspon and Edwards at shortstop, scoring Garcia to give the Knights a 1-0 lead.\nSpartans starting pitcher Lauren O'Leary came right back unfazed, striking out the next two batters to keep the damage from escalating. It's that kind of composure that has epitomized O'Leary's entire high school career.\n\"You never want to show a crack in your armor, you always want to stay the same,\" said O'Leary, explaining why she's always calm on the mound.\nShe pitched another complete game, giving six hits, no walks and striking out 10.\nThursday was the first time the Spartans (24-3) have trailed in the playoffs. But they weren't behind long, as La Cañada put up five runs in the second inning. The bottom of the order started the outburst when Shirley Drange — the Spartans' No. 7 hitter — started the inning with a walk. Selina Mohr followed with a slap-hit single that went underneath the glove of Katella's third baseman. La Cañada No. 9 hitter, Jessica Ogden, than laid down a sacrifice bunt, putting runners on second and third with one out.\nThe Knights pitched around Edwards to get to Kelsey Drange, who drove in her sister, Shirley, with a single that landed perfectly between the Katella centerfielder and shortstop.\n\"Whenever they walk Anna I want to score her,\" Kelsey said. \"If they're not going to come at her they're going to come at me.\"\nCatherine Horner worked a bases-loaded walk to give La Cañada a 2-0 lead.\nBut it was Siepler who came up with the big hit of the day, delivering a bases-clearing double that gave the Spartans a 5-0 advantage.\n\"She was patient at the plate and she has really quick hands so when they pitch her inside she's a really tough out,\" Matthews said. \"When the first one falls it builds up confidence and it starts to roll.\"\nThat's exactly what happened. Siepler extended La Cañada's lead to 6-1 in the bottom of the fourth with a booming sacrifice fly that brought Ogden around to score.\n\"That first hit kind",
        "baseline": " of gave me my confidence back and that obviously helped for my last at-bats,\" said Siepler, echoing Matthews' words.\nSiepler finished her day the plate with a double down the left-field line in the bottom of the sixth. She came around to score on a RBI-single from Thompson, which ended the scoring.\n\"Our lineup, one through nine, has come out and produced this year,\" Matthews said. \"If they're going to put Anna on and start innings like that, fine. That's why Anna is in that leadoff spot, if they walk her she's going to make them pay one way or another.\"\nThe Spartans will play again on Tuesday when they host South El Monte at 3:15 p.m. in the semifinal game — the round La Cañada lost in last year.\n\"We are using [last season] as motivation this year to get better and hopefully get past that round,\" O'Leary said.",

        "prompt": "KIRKLAND, Wash. — Bill and Melinda Gates, as the world’s top philanthropists, are rethinking their work in America as they confront what they consider their unsatisfactory track record on schools, the country’s growing inequity and a president they disagree with more than any other.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, the couple said they’re concerned about President Donald Trump’s “America first” worldview. They’ve made known their differences with the president and his party on issues including foreign aid, taxes and protections for immigrant youth in the country illegally.\nAnd they said they’re now digging into the layers of U.S. poverty that they haven’t been deeply involved with at the national level, including employment, race, housing, mental health, incarceration and substance abuse.\n“We are not seeing the mobility out of poverty in the same way in the United States as it used to exist,” Melinda Gates said.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is studying these topics with no plans yet for any particular initiatives, though it has done related work at home in Washington state on a much smaller scale. Last year, it funded a grant for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities to look into state and federal policies that can reduce poverty.\nOnce the world’s richest man, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has marked a decade since transitioning away from the tech giant to focus on philanthropy. He said he’s had two meetings with Trump, where they discussed innovation in education, energy and health — including vaccines, which Trump has voiced skepticism about.\n“I got, both times, to talk about the miracle of vaccines and how those are good things,” Bill Gates said.\nMelinda Gates, who left her job at Microsoft to raise their three children before turning to the foundation full-time, has lately embraced her role as a public figure more boldly. She called out Trump’s behaviour, saying the president has a responsibility to be a good role model when he speaks and tweets, and that his verbal attacks don’t belong in the public discourse.\nTrump has said he’s a counterpuncher who goes after people when they go after him, only 10 times harder.\nTaking a more reflective review of their work than in years past, the couple in their annual letter published Tuesday also answered 10 questions critics often ask them. They acknowledge it’s unfair that they have so much wealth and influence but reject the notion that they’re imposing their values on other cultures.\n“Behind the scenes, these are the tough, tough questions that people are asking us, and yeah, we have to wrestle with them ourselves,” Melinda Gates said in the Feb. 1 interview.\nSince 2000, the Seattle-based private foundation has amassed an endowment worth over $40 billion, which includes a large portion of billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s fortune. The Gates Foundation has given money to various programs in more than 100 countries, as well as in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nTheir approach to giving has shifted the philanthropy world as a whole. They’ve been criticized for prescribing how the money is spent and then expecting tangible proof their investments work.\nAbout 75 per cent of the foundation’s resources are dedicated to global health and development. Bill Gates said they’re proudest of their efforts to help eradicate polio and curb the number of child deaths, calling those global health improvements a miracle.\nBut he concedes the same level of progress didn’t happen in the U.S. with their strategy of chasing equity through education reform. U.S. education initiatives are a distant second funding priority for the foundation, but the $450 million the Gateses spend annually on the issue makes them the top funders of schools reform in America.\nThey’ve been major supporters of charter schools and also pushed Common Core education standards, teacher evaluation systems that factored in student test scores and a smaller schools model — highly polarizing education policy reforms that didn’t dramatically change student outcomes but made the Gateses deeply unpopular in some communities.\n“It’s in taking all of those lessons and saying, ‘OK, but did they reach the majority of the school districts?

        "prompt": "PANAMA CITY� By a 3-2 vote, the Bay County Commission on Tuesday saved delinquent property taxpayers about $140,000 by choosing to give less public notice on outstanding tax bills.\nThe commission awarded the bid for publishing the delinquent taxes notice to the Bay County Bullet, which had the low bid for partial distribution. By law, the commission must run the list in a local newspaper.\nChairman George Gainer cast the deciding vote, siding with commissioners Bill Dozier and Mike Nelson. Commissioners Mike Thomas and Guy Tunnell voted against the measure, wanting to give even less public notice.\nThe Bullet and the Panama City News Herald were given a chance to bid on three options: putting the list in 850 papers, 6,000 papers and 23,000 papers. All three would run the list once a week for three straight weeks.\nThe News Herald bid on all three options, while the Bullet only bid on the first two. The commission chose the mid-range, 6,000-paper option, for which the Bullet had the lowest bid.\nCounty attorney Terrell Arline told the commission the courts have ruled that to abide by state statute, the list doesn�t need to run in every copy of the local newspaper with the highest circulation. He also said delinquent taxpayers already have received two mailed notices.\n�This is an additional notice and the courts have said essentially it�s up to the county commission who has to � determine what�s reasonable,� he said.\nNone of the commissioners showed interest in the traditional 23,000-paper option. They were split between the 6,000- and 850-paper option, all saying they wanted to save the delinquent taxpayers money.\nBy statute the cost of the notices is paid not by the county, but by the people who failed to pay their taxes on time. But commissioners said these property owners contribute to the county�s revenue stream and, thus, the commission should look out for their tax bills, too, even if they are paying late. Advertising the list last year cost about $215,000.\nThomas, who said he�s not embarrassed that he is one of those who hasn�t always paid his property taxes on time, also pushed for the least expensive option.\n�If our attorney says it�s legal, I don�t know why we don�t do the smallest [circulation] and even save more money,� he said.\nCommissioner Bill Dozier said he did not care for an editorial in Sunday�s News Herald that suggested full public notification should not be sacrificed in the name of helping property owners who don�t pay their taxes on time.\n�In the past, I just don�t appreciate the way they have thrown salt in the wound of people who are trying to get by and pay their taxes � just by gouging them and making them pay a higher price,� he said.\nOn the 6,000-paper option, The News Herald bid 25 cents per",

St John ambulance officers are caring and non-judgmental professionals who are there to help, but trying to treat someone vomiting over you, attacking you or being so incoherent or unconscious that the patient can't explain what is wrong, complicates treatment and is not ideal.\"",

        "prompt": "The Flash is amongst the most troubled entries in the DC movie universe up to this point, but Warner Bros. is doing what they can to get it moving down the right track. John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein of Game Night fame were brought on to direct last year and now we have word that they're also going to be rewriting the script. Additionally, a new producer in the form of Michael Disco has boarded the project as he has launched his own production company, The Disco Factory.\nStarting with Michael Disco, he's been working at Warner Bros.' New Line for nearly 20 years. He recently decided to venture out into producing and, because of his long-standing relationship with the studio, signed a two-year producing deal. He will be directly involved with two major projects right off the bat; The Sopranos prequel movie The Many Saints of Newark and The Flash. Warner Bros. Pictures chairman Toby Emmerich had this to say.\n\"Michael Disco started working with us at New Line 19 years ago. He's one of those people you hope will be on your team throughout their career. He has always been passionate about and incredibly talented in both development and production, so it makes sense that he's chosen to segue into producing. I'm both proud and happy that he will be staying here and making his films at our studio, where he has been a beloved and trusted colleague.\"\nBringing some new blood on board could be just what this project needs. So far, several filmmakers have come and gone. Originally, Seth Grahame-Smith was set to make his directorial debut with the DC Comics adaptation and that ultimately fell through. Then Rick Famuyiwa (Dope) spent time attached to direct and wrote his own version of the script. Once he departed, Joby Harold (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) was tapped to do a page-one rewrite and it ultimately turned into a Flashpoint adaptation. Again, with this latest rewrite, that's out the window. Michael Disco had this to say about his new deal with the studio.\n\"I am so grateful to Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Carolyn Blackwood and Walter Hamada for their",
        "baseline": " incredible support in making this transition happen. I've spent my entire career with Warner/New Line and I'm thrilled to be continuing my relationship with the visionary and creative executives at both companies.\"\nThe studio is now more focused on DC movies that can stand on their own, as opposed to worrying so much about building a heavily connected universe, given the success of both Aquaman and Wonder Woman. The studio shifted their strategy in a big way following the disappointment of Justice League. Ezra Miller made his debut as the Scarlet Speedster in the massive team-up flick.\nJohn Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein previously helped pen Spider-Man: Homecoming, in addition to Game Night, and both of those worked out quite well. Ezra Miller is still attached to star as Barry Allen and he recently promised this will be a gift to DC fans and that they're taking the time to make sure they get it right.

Thing is, the referee got it right. This time.\nChelsea, their opponents in next week’s Carabao Cup semi-final, are durable, obstinate and damn well difficult to beat.\nThe biggest chance of the first half went Chelsea’s way.\nCalum Chambers and Shkodran Mustafi managed to let a hopeful, looping ball drop behind them. Alvaro Morata raced clear, only the keeper to beat, to put Chelsea in front. Instead he missed, poking his effort hopelessly wide of Petr Cech’s left-hand post.\nArsenal responded, playing like a team with a lot of work to do to bridge that gap between Ropey League and Champions League football.\nFor a time they looked good for it.\nMesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Wilshere were the driving force as Arsenal got about these Chelsea boys.\nThibaut Courtois was a towering presence every time Arsenal got in behind Chelsea’s defence. It almost turned into his night.\nHe got a glove to Sanchez’s chance that rebounded off both posts, turning on to the paintwork before it rolled across the line and against the other.\nArsenal grew in confidence, with Ozil and Wilshere matching Cesc Fabregas and Hazard for the fancy footwork.\nOzil provided the next chance, with Gary Cahill sliding all over the penalty area when Alexandre Lacazette turned him in the area.\nThe striker swivelled, shooting at Chelsea’s goal, but Courtois came to the rescue again.\nChelsea turned a corner, with Cech tipping Tiemoue Bakayoko’s chance over the bar, after a clever combination between Hazard and Fabregas.\nFrom the corner, Morata headed over the bar.\nBoth teams were coming to the boil, with Wilshere cautioned after taking Fabregas clean out. The Spaniard soon got him back and he, too, was booked.\nHazard came alive at the start of the second half, with Cech down to his right to claw away his effort.\nFrom the follow-up, he got down to his left",

She is the first woman to win a prestigious Tusk award. The Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa, give for lifetime achievement, went to John Kahekwa, 53, who has spent his career protecting the Grauer’s gorilla, another endangered species, in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Kahuzi-Biega national park. Like Sacaia, he remained in his post through many years of war.\nSacaia was born on the edge of Angola’s vast Luando reserve sometime in the early 1950s. Orphaned in childhood, the reserve employed him as a kitchen assistant at 14 and a ranger at 18. At that time there were more than 2,000 giant sables - Angola’s national symbol - in Luando, and around 200 in the Cangandala national park, the only other place where they are found. Civil war erupted in 1975. Four years later Sacaia was caught by Unita guerillas who had moved into the 830,000-hectare reserve. They tied him up, intending to kill him, but after two days he escaped, swam across the crocodile-infested Luando river, and walked 40 miles through the bush to safety.\nSacaia continued to monitor Luando’s sables through more than two decades of warfare, hiking deep into the reserve, barefoot and for days at a time, though the reserve’s authorities had long since fled. He did his best to protect the animals from guerillas and poachers who killed them for their meat. “I worked for nothing – no money, no food, no boots, no uniform, no tents, only the rain,” he said.\nBy the time the war ended in 2002 there were just nine sables left in Cangandala, all females. The Kissama Foundation, a wildlife NGO, spent two fruitless months searching for sables in Luando. Finally they turned to Sacaia, who knew of an area where they had survived that was so remote no white person or vehicle had visited it for 30 years. The foundation hired a helicopter and found the reserve’s last sables exactly where Sacaia had said. It subsequently moved two bulls to Cangandala and launched a successful breeding programme. Luando now has about 140 sables, and Cangandala 50.\nSacaia now heads a team of 22 “sable shepherds” in Luando to whom the foundation pays small stipends. He is training a new generation, including two of his sons, to guard the sables, and still leads patrols deep into the bush for two or three weeks at a time. The dangers have not gone away. Three times he has been fired at by poachers, so he now carries an AK-47. Last year he was caught in a mantrap. His leg survived only because he was wearing tough new boots, but two fellow shepherds had to carry him 12 miles to the nearest village.\nCathy Dreyer, winner of the Tusk Award for Conservation in Africa, was a carpenter’s daughter born in Cape Town. She did not see a rhino until she was a 19-year-old student working with the renowned veterinarian Peter Morkel. He was so impressed that he employed her in the SANParks game capture team.\nIn 2012 Dreyer became conservation manager of a reserve in the Eastern Cape that she does not want named to protect its black rhinos from poachers. Of more than a hundred she has lost seven this year, but has notched, named and taken the DNA of almost every survivor so they can be monitored by 26 full time rangers and two tracker dogs. She flies over the reserve at dawn most days, searching for poachers. Last year she briefed Prince Harry, but is so determined to protect her rhinos that she refused to let him visit the reserve for fear of the publicity. The prince took it well. “She’s very impressive, hugely passionate, and just a damn nice woman,” he wrote afterwards.\nJohn Kahekwa, winner of the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa, grew up beside the Kahuzi-Biega national park in the eastern Congo which his uncle helped establish. He became a ranger charged with habituating the park’s rare Grauer’s gorillas as it pioneered gorilla tourism in the late 1970s. But for most of his 23 years as a ranger he found himself fighting the militias, poachers, refugees and illegal loggers and miners who invaded the park as war engulfed the region after 1990.\nKahekwa went on joint patrols with the Congolese army to deter the incursions. He was shot at several times, and lost many colleagues. By the time the conflict ended in the early 2000s, the gorilla population had halved to about 130. Maheshe, a silverback who appeared on Congolese bank notes, was dead. So was Mushamuka, who featured in the film 'Gorillas in the Mist’.\nBut Kahekwa also realised that impoverished local communities needed",
        "baseline": " alternative livelihoods so they did not plunder the park. “Empty stomachs have no ears,” the poachers told him. In 1985 he used a tourist’s $10 tip to buy ten t-shirts on which he printed “I tracked gorillas in Zaire”. He sold them for $10 each and bought more. By 1992 he had amassed $6,000 with which he founded an NGO, Pole Pole ('Slowly slowly’). It has since opened schools, planted four million trees outside the park to stop deforestation, trained former poachers to make clothes and woodcarvings, and built ponds to provide fish as alternative to bush meat and the algae spirulina for nutrition. After decades of precipitous decline, the park’s gorilla population is growing again and four of Kahekwa’s nine children are training, he says, “to be the next generation to take care of the gorillas”.",

Christopher Caruso, D-Bridgeport, who has been working with the neighborhood group to ensure that areas of the proposed master plan and zoning map don't infringe on residential areas, said Conte's actions cast a dark shadow over the entire process.\n\"When the public was told they could not speak anymore but the associate city attorney is going out and getting information from developers, that's shutting out the public. The public is not privy to what is discussed and it places in question serious doubt about the master plan,\" Caruso said.\nThe neighborhood group first publicly spoke out against Conte's alleged bad behavior at the PZC's regular meeting in June. At the time, Conte said he only asked a land-use lawyer for more information on a petition at the request of the PZC.\n\"These individuals [land-use lawyers] are friends of mine and I do on occasion speak to them. There is nothing that they can whisper in my ear that would change the vote of the commission,\" Conte said at the meeting. \"I don't advocate one way or another. It doesn't matter to me what the vote is.\"\nCaruso said Conte overstepped his boundaries by \"stepping outside of his impartial role\" as legal counsel and speaking to the developers and lawyers. He questioned why the PZC's staff was not asked to speak to developers instead.\nConte did not return several calls for comment.\nIn a",

But he's not willing to do that. That's the same old stuff in Bridgeport,\" he said.\nStill, Voytek holds out hope that Finch would \"quietly tell Conte not to show up\" at Monday's public hearing on the city's Master Plan of Conservation and Development \"because he's a distraction.\"\nThe public hearing will begin at 6 p.m. in the Council Chambers at City Hall.",

        "prompt": "DALLAS � Manhattan seemed like a big place to Cody Whitehair when he enrolled at Kansas State four years ago.\nBecause of growing up in Abilene, a town of roughly 6,800, the packed streets running through the K-State campus and the businesses across Manhattan made his new home, a town of approximately 56,000, seem bigger than it actually was.\nSo you can imagine his shock when he traveled to much larger cities as an offensive lineman on the K-State football team. He has been to Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Phoenix and San Antonio, some of the biggest cities in the nation. At each location, he marveled at the dense traffic, noting that you can�t do anything in a densely populated area without it taking an extra 15 minutes.\n�I think I will just go back to Abilene,� Whitehair said last week when speaking about his travels.\nHe has taken a much different approach on the football field.\nAt 6-foot-4 and 305 pounds, Whitehair has the ideal body to play center or guard, yet he enters his senior season as one of the most respected left tackles in the Big 12, if not the nation. It�s the position many consider to be the most important on the offensive line, the guy that defends his quarterback�s blind side by constantly fighting off determined defensive ends. He played right tackle as a freshman and also spent many games at left guard, collecting all-conference honors along the way.\nBut that wasn�t enough. Whitehair wanted the extra responsibilities that come with protecting the left side of K-State�s offensive line. Even though he lacks the height and length of the prototypical left tackle, he quickly volunteered to change positions when there was an opening.\nThat is certainly Whitehair, a four-year starter who has played nearly every snap of his last 13 games at left tackle.\nTeammates need only study his blocking techniques to understand Whitehair. The two K-State linemen who served at left tackle before him were giants, each of them towering above the rest of the roster at 6-8 or 6-9. They were power forwards with long arms and heft. One of them, Cornelius Lucas, is now blocking for the Detroit Lions",
        "baseline": ". They defended a pass rush with their upper bodies.\nWhitehair uses a different strategy that requires more effort, but produces similar results.\nWhitehair won more plays than he lost a year ago, regularly giving then-quarterback Jake Waters time to survey the field and throw accurate passes. This year, with a new quarterback and new receivers, he may be tasked with blocking for the run more often, but he is up for the challenge.\nWhen he switched to left tackle, he knew more responsibilities were on the way. That includes taking over as a leader for former center B.J. Finney. Like Finney, Whitehair will spend five years at K-State after redshirting in 2011. He dedicated the offseason to improving his individual skills and helping his teammates. Four starters return, and he has pushed them.\nWhitehair may play the most important position on the offensive line, but he also knows how important it is for his line to block as a unit.",

Don’t take nothing for granted.\n\"I just told them to keep going,\" Durr said. \"It goes by fast — four years and then you’re done. So don’t cheat that process and really soak it all in, each day, each week. You want to try to gain as much as you can throughout your four years.\"\nIf there's a player best-served to deliver that message, it's Durr, arguably the most accomplished player in Cardinals history. She ends her career ranked second in points. She was an All-American. She twice won ACC Player of the Year.\nAsked what that meant to her, she said Sunday that she's just \"thankful.\"\n\"I can't even put it into words,\" Durr said. \"Our fans, and my teammates, and my family, this has been a second home. I’m just very thankful for everybody in my circle. What they’ve done for me. They’ve even cheered me on through my bad nights, bad games.\"\nDespite the ending, she and her fellow seniors Sam Fuehring and Arica Carter will leave Louisville after the winningest four-year stretch in program history, a run that includes a Final Four and three Sweet 16s.\n\"You can't put a price tag on what these young women do, the impact they've had in our city,\" Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. \"It's been pretty remarkable, and I love them all. They'll be missed but will never be forgotten because they'll always be a part of our family.\"\nUnlike Durr, a McDonald's All-American as a high school recruit, Fuehring and Carter's careers have been more about growth and development, not only for them but for their teammates.\n\"I think we built this program along with Coach Walz. We helped him,\" said Fuehring, adding that it was great to have Durr and Carter along with her \"on this ride.\"\n\"There were times that all of us could have transferred because of hardships, but we didn’t and we stuck to it,\" Fuehring said.\nCarter's path was even more uneven, as she's in her fifth season after missing a year due to a groin injury. She's most proud of the success. But she's even prouder of the fight of her teammates, all the way to the end, including Sunday's game.\n\"Our team has shown all year that we’re a great team,\" she said. \"We’re a team that’s going to fight. We’re a team that’s going to hit you. We’re",
        "baseline": " a team that you have to worry about. I’m not happy that we lost by I’m proud of this team.\"\nTheir teammates agreed that the trio's impact is going to be felt next season. Dana Evans, a sophomore, can point out which quality for each senior — Carter's leadership, Fuehring's toughness and Durr's humility.\n\"She's a humble superstar,\" Evans said. \"She’s that positive light all the time.\"\nDurr's impact will likely be felt a little more based on her individual accomplishments. Junior Jazmine Jones said she's done \"everything\" for the program.\n\"Everybody in the community, the city, the state of Kentucky should appreciate Asia,\" she said. \"She could have gone anywhere in the world but she chose Louisville.\"\nThen she made a prediction that will extend her legacy even longer.\n\"No. 25 should go in the rafters, for sure,\" Jones said.",

        "prompt": "Mike Smith occupied the starter’s net which, considering Monday was the first practice of the Calgary Flames’ first-round Stanley Cup playoff preparations, was significant.\nAdd that nugget of information to the quality of the 37-year-old netminder’s assignments during the last few weeks (including the team’s Western Conference-clinching game versus the San Jose Sharks and Saturday’s finale versus the Edmonton Oilers) and even the most fringe observer can connect the dots.\nSmith will likely be between the pipes for Thursday’s Game 1 of the Western Conference quarter-final series against the Colorado Avalanche.\nIt would be the culmination of a few weeks’ worth of nod-worthy performances, an internal reward for his perseverance after cringe-worthy numbers to start the 2018-19 National Hockey League regular season.\nBut it’s also logical to go with the guy that’s been there before, won games when the slate is wiped clean and all bets are off and understands that every round in the NHL post-season requires maximum effort.\nThat was exactly Smith’s experience in the 2012 playoffs during a Cinderella-type run with the then-Phoenix Coyotes that ended with a five-game knockout punch from the eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.\nSeven years ago, Smith was the Coyotes’ No. 1 — a first-time feeling for him after serving as the understudy to Dwayne Roloson with the Tampa Bay Lightning the previous season.\nBack then, the Coyotes had clinched the Pacific Division and were the third-best team in the Western Conference in large part due to Smith’s stellar goaltending.\nAs Western Conference champions and the No. 1 seed, the Flames are not tip-toeing into this series playing the No. 8 Avalanche. Their goaltending has been a hot-button conversation topic all year and has been at the forefront of hockey talk heading into the post-season.\nFlames head coach Bill Peters told reporters that they’ve made a decision on their No. 1 netminder: “The guy that gives us the best chance to win,” Peters said (insert eye roll here), adding that they are keeping their plan top secret until Thursday.\nWhen asked directly, Smith said he had not been informed of his job requirements.\nDavid Rittich went 27-9-5 with a 2.61 goals",
        "baseline": " against average and a .911 save percentage in his first full NHL season and has better numbers than Smith (23-16-2, a 2.72 goals against average and an .898 save percentage). The 26-year-old deserves a shot because there’s only one way to get experience.\nBut, at least for Game 1, leaning on Smith’s trench warfare experience is a safe option.\nIncluding Rittich, 12 members of the Flames have never played in the post-season dance.\nAnd while it’s been seven years since his last taste with a pile of miles in between, Smith has enough intel to know that each bout — especially the first one — is a slugfest.\n“The first round is always full of piss and vinegar,” Smith said. “It seems likes it’s always like that. Everyone’s just amped up to be in the playoffs and the first round.",

Benfield took two shots at the deputy before breaking into the first home where the assault took place, police said.\nOnly after SWAT officers showed up and charged through the door was Benfield arrested.\nHe is charged with burglary, pointing and presenting a firearm, and two drug charges. He was given a $72,000 bond late Tuesday, but that likely will be moot as other charges – including assault on a police officer with intent to kill – are pending, according to deputies and jail records.\nYet even more frustrating to the cops who face these felons carrying guns, is that Benfield was out on bond on felony drug charges from Lexington County when Sunday’s crime happened, according to the Lexington County Sheriff’s Office.\nBenfield was charged in January on two drug felonies, then bonded out on $25,000 bond four days later, Lexington officials said.\nWorse, Benfield is on probation for a felony drug conviction, according to state probation officials. He was sentenced in 2011 to two years in prison but was released in June 2012.\nHis arrest record dates back to 2006, with convictions starting in 2009, State Law Enforcement Division records show.\nBolin was not the only police officer threatened Sunday.\nThe suspect threatened the officers so seriously that one had to draw her weapon to protect herself and the victim.\nThe families of these police officers spend",

        "prompt": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - World number one Simona Halep shrugged off a shock first-round 6-2 6-4 loss to Kaia Kanepi at the U.S. Open on Monday as simply a “bad day” and it certainly was that as no top seed had ever made a worse start at Flushing Meadows.\nThis kind of opening-round calamity in women’s Grand Slam tennis is rarer than a Rafael Nadal loss on clay.\nOnly on five previous occasions in the Open era had a women’s top seed lost in the first round and never before had one fallen at the opening hurdle in New York.\n“It’s just a day and it’s a bad day,” said a misfiring Halep, who managed just nine winners while committing 25 forced errors. “It’s tough to lose. Sometimes I have tears. It’s normal but now I feel better.\nIn nine visits to Flushing Meadows the speedy Romanian has lost her opening match on three occasions, including the last two.\nLosing in the first round in her maiden U.S. Open would qualify as a learning experience and last year the second-seeded Halep had the bad luck to draw Maria Sharapova, the 2006 U.S. Open winner who was playing her first Grand Slam since returning from a 15-month doping ban.\nBut this year there were no excuses.\nHalep had risen to the top of the world rankings.",

She played quarter-finals last year,” Halep said. “Actually, I expected her to play like that without fear and hitting the balls really strong.",

        "prompt": "Long gone are the days when defenders of factory farming argued that farm animals simply aren't capable of suffering, or are too stupid to even know they're suffering, as was sometimes self-servingly claimed. Today's proponents of animal agribusiness instead acknowledge that of course they're concerned about preventing animal suffering, but that our nation's billions of chickens, turkeys, pigs, and other farm animals could hardly be happier.\nWe saw this phenomenon in a recent New York Times article when someone who opposes a law banning force-feeding ducks and geese for foie gras was quoted as arguing that the practice is something the birds actually look forward to.\nThe article was about California's overwhelmingly passed law banning the force-feeding of fowl, and the opponent of the law assured readers concerned about animal cruelty, \"I've seen the videos, and everyone says the same thing: they all seem to run up to be fed.\"\nLet's back up. Foie gras, French for fatty liver, is a so-called delicacy produced by force-feeding ducks or geese several times per day until their livers become diseased and enlarge up to ten times their normal size. Most people wouldn't want to eat any part of a diseased animal, but in the case of foie gras, it's the diseased organ itself on which consumers dine.\nNow, back to the claim that the ducks \"run up to be fed.\" Watching a short video taken by Compassion Over Killing during a public tour of Hudson Valley Foie Gras (the largest foie gras factory farm in the U.S.) shows that far from running to their abusers with mouths agape, ducks are actually huddled in the corner and must be grabbed and dragged in order to be force-fed. It's hard to understand how anyone could watch such a video and not applaud the landslide vote in the California legislature to provide a reasonable phase-out and eventually bring the practice to an end.\nEven many foie gras consumers acknowledge that the practice isn't pleasant. One of them is Mark Caro, a Chicago Tribune writer. In his book, The Foie Gras Wars, Caro visits Sonoma Foie Gras, a producer in California where a worker was force-feeding birds who were \"huddled in the corner of the pen.\" That worker tells Caro that \"they know what's going to happen and they don't like to be grabbed.\" Later on in his tour of the facility, Caro writes \"upon [the worker's] appearance, they huddled in the corner and looked away, resisting the catch without getting wild.... A bunch of them were panting.\"\nIt's not just common sense that birds don't want to be force-fed several times a day. The EU's Scientific Veterinary Committee reviewed the science on the issue and found that indeed the force-feeding is detrimental to the animals' welfare, and that mortality rates for force-fed ducks and geese are many times the norm. This is what led so many EU countries to ban foie gras. And Israel -- formerly the fourth largest producer of foie gras -- banned the practice when the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the routine force-feeding violates the country's preexisting prohibition on animal torture.\nEven the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau considered the topic and ruled that D'Artagnan's -- the largest distributor of foie gras -- claims of humane treatment were not backed up and should be discontinued. These are among the reasons famed chefs like Wolfgang Puck refuse to use foie gras.\nBut none of this stops the foie gras industry's promoters from making their \"humane-",
        "baseline": "washing\" claims. It brings to mind other sectors of animal agribusiness that defend obviously inhumane practices. Whether it's veal producers locking their calves in tiny crates and feigning concern that they might suffer if allowed to move, or pork producers who cage breeding pigs so they can't even turn around and assure us that the pigs like it this way, there's no shortage of absurd attempts to explain away farm animal abuse.\nCommon sense and clear science are hard things to combat, but factory farming's purveyors will continue to refine their messaging to try and defend the indefensible. It won't do them much good in the long run. Through all of this, one thing is clear: The more Americans learn about what happens to farm animals -- whether on factory farms producing foie gras, eggs, veal, or pork -- the greater the call for reform will be.\nPaul Shapiro is the senior director of farm animal protection for The Humane Society of the United States.",

        "prompt": "Ken Dodd, a titan of a vanishing age of British comedy whose UK fame at its peak rivalled that of The Beatles, has died. He was 90.\nHe died on Sunday at his home in Knotty Ash, Liverpool - the same house where he was born in 1927.\nDodd, who had recently been hospitalised with a chest infection, married his long-time partner Anne Jones on Friday.\nInstantly recognisable for his unruly mop of hair and snaggle-toothed grin, he came up through the ranks of Britain's variety circuit.\nHe was famous for his rapid- fire one-liners, surreal imaginative flights of fancy, use of fanciful words like \"tattyfilarious\" and marathon stand-up shows.\nIn the 1960s he held the Guinness world record for the longest joke-telling session: 1,500 in three-and-a-half hours.\nHis signature prop was a tickling stick - a comedy feather duster - and he was often joined by colourfully clad diminutive companions known as the Diddy Men.\nIn his 1960s and 70s heyday, Dodd's fame in Britain was stratospheric. He played a record 42 straight weeks at the London Palladium, hosted prime-time TV shows and hit the music charts with songs including his signature tune, Happiness.\nHis 1965 song, Tears, was the third-best-selling single of the decade in Britain, surpassed only by The Beatles' She Loves You and I Want To Hold Your Hand.\nA low point for Dodd came in 1989, when he was charged with tax fraud.\nHe was acquitted after a five-week trial at which his lawyer, George Carman, told jurors: \"Some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants.\"\nDodd was knighted last year, becoming Sir Ken Dodd. He gave his final performance in Liverpool at the end of December.\nFlags on official buildings flew at half-mast in the city yesterday.\nFans had left flowers and tickling sticks in tribute outside his home, where his wife spoke to reporters.\n\"The world has lost a most life-enhancing, brilliant, creat- ive comedian with an operatically trained voice who just wanted to make people happy,\" she said.\nStars including Paul McCartney, David Walliams, Dara O Briain and Ant and Dec were among those to mourn the legendary funnyman.\n\"Farewell to my fellow Liverpudlian, the tattyfilarious Ken Dodd,\" McCartney wrote on Instagram.\n\"Beloved by many people in Britain and a great champion of his home city and comedy.\n\"We met him on a few occasions as The Beatles and always ended up in tears of laughter.\n\"Today, it's tears of sadness as well. See you, Doddy.\"\nWalliams said of the veteran entertainer: \"Comedy flowed through him like water. RIP Ken Dodd.\" Referring to his distinctive appearance, the wild hair and unruly teeth, the Britain's Got Talent judge added: \"A face made for comedy.\"\nBray-born comedian Dara O Briain remembered seeing Dodd at one of his \"incredible five-hour shows\".\n\"He was an education to watch, and afterwards, at 1.30am, he had beers with me in the dressing room and talked showbiz. A privilege, and a loss. RIP,\" he added.\nIn another Instagram post, stand-up star John Bishop, who is also from Liverpool, said: \"True comedy legend. RIP Ken Dodd.\"\nMayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson announced that there would be a book of condolence opened in Dodd's honour.\n\"Liverpool today mourns one of its most famous sons, the greatest ever comedian, Ken Dodd,\" he said. \"We are comforted by the joy and happiness he brought the world.\"\nOn Twitter, TV presenters Ant and Dec said: \"So sad to hear of the passing of Ken Dodd. A comedy legend.\"\nComedian and quiz show host Sandi Toksvig wrote: \"Best dinner companion I ever sat next to. Don't think I said a word.\nComic and actor Russ Abbot said: \"Sadly another legend has passed away.\n\"An icon, a one-off and a true professor of comedy. One of the greatest. How tickled I am to have known him.\"\nComedian Dawn French paid tribute to Dodd with one of his famous jokes, writing on Twitter: \"What a wonderful day for sticking a cucumber through your neighbour's letter box and shouting, 'The aliens have landed'. Tatty bye, Doddy. And thanks\".\nActor and presenter Brian Conley wrote: \"Thanks for all the chats and guidance, you always had time for everyone. Dear Doddy, tatty bye.\"\nTV personality Claire Swee- ney, another Liverpudlian, shared photos of the star's 90th birthday party on Twitter and wrote: \"I was thrilled you had the best birthday party in Liverpool before you left us.\"\nLiverpool comic Les Dennis posted: \"Losing Ken means losing the last music hall great.",

Tatty Bye, Doddy.\"\nOther tributes came from actor John Challis, who played Boycie in the BBC comedy series Only Fools And Horses, and Hollyoaks actor Annie Wallace, who described Dodd as a \"true son of beautiful Liverpool\".\nActor and director Samuel West said: \"Remembering Ken Dodd performing at the Cruc-ible Theatre.\n\"We had to order taxis home for all the staff.\n\"His set finished after midnight, and nobody wanted a second less. May we all fill 90 years so well.\"\nRadio legend Tony Blackburn wrote: \"So sorry to hear that Ken Dodd has died.\n\"I went to see his shows and met him several times and found him to be a very lovely man.\n\"Thanks for all the laughs, Ken.

A bag is part of your corporate armour, but the right one can also be a talking point or an ice breaker – a nice change from discussing the weather before you get down to business.\nIn-between seasons is a great time to invest as a new bag – especially one in an unexpected colour – can create a multitude of fresh outfit options from your wardrobe. I’m not a pastels girl, preferring bolder tones, but I have been seriously considering a pale pink bag, especially in this weather. Top of my wishlist is the Hex bag from British brand Ennigaldi, which is the perfect shade of rose with a white flap and strap; it would look lovely with grey and navy now and even better with warmer weather gear.\nHigh street favourites from Zara to Dune have also picked up on the pastel trend, and The Cambridge Satchel Company, another excellent brand produced in Britain, has some lovely options.\nIf pastels aren’t for you, a navy bag is a really useful wardrobe tool in these transitional months",

Wandler’s Mia tote is beautifully simple and modern, or look at Strathberry, a favourite of the Duchess of Sussex. Hobbs also has a chic mock-croc tote.\nFinally, don’t rule out the backpack option as too casual: it has been given a makeover in recent years, and there are some very office-appropriate versions that can be worn beyond the commute. Invest in a hard-wearing style in a colour that can work all year round – you can always carry a smaller bag as well for easy access to your phone and wallet.\nI prefer the most minimal of styles that don’t interfere with what you are wearing – Smythson’s Burlington range wins the cost-per-wear argument for me, and John Lewis and Partner’s Harper style is as classic as you can get.",

Completion is scheduled within a year.\nMost insurance companies use an Insurance Services Office rating to assess risk in relation to fire protection when developing insurance premiums. The ISO rating is based on a 1-to-10 scale. Ten is the riskiest and has, most likely, the highest rates and premiums.\nJeremy Robshaw, public information officer for St. Johns County Fire Rescue, said properties that are farther than five miles from a fire station and more than 1,000 feet from a fire hydrant have significantly higher rates and premiums.\nThe closest fire station to the Palencia area right now is Station 16 in World Golf Village, which is more than 15 miles from the Palencia area.\n\"I'm sure the people in Palencia are real happy about the station,\" Robshaw said.",

He said the new station is the first step in bringing more businesses to the area.\n\"There's very little in the way of shopping and schools out here,\" King said. \"We've always had to travel to everything. This is a great way to help encourage additional businesses to move into the Palencia area.\"\nTotal cost of the 8,100-square-foot station is $1.3 million, which was funded through a bond secured by the St. Johns County Commission.\nUpon completion of the project by next summer, the station will house a staff of four St. Johns County Fire Rescue personnel and one advanced life support engine fire truck.\nRobshaw said the station is large enough to support more personnel in the future.",

        "prompt": "Over the past year, Walmart has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed.\nWalmart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon, he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition.\nLore pointed specifically to the \"4,600\" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year.\nRoughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. \"We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,\" Lore said.\nAfter purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas.\nWal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart.\nLore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps.\nPhysical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix.\nBut those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that.\nLore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor",
        "baseline": " often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior.\nIt's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores.\nWal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace.\nA quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right.\nAdam Levy owns shares of Amazon.

I own what I consider to be the best, most comfortable headphones I can afford, one \"can\" style, the other earbuds. But when I use either for more than a half hour, the cans grow clammy and the buds grow irritating.\nNow two companies, one established and one upstart, are venturing into the area of off-the-ear headphone designs. Sony's new Future Lab Program, an experimental initiative that uses technology to \"co-create new lifestyles and user value,\" has come up with a set of headphones that look less like cans and more like the St. Louis Arch.\nAn alternative approach has been created by Tokyo-based musician and inventor Yazz Imamura in the form of his Vie Shair headphones. Although they're can-style, they feature a 3D-printed matrix that attaches to the cans and contacts the end user's skull around the ear, so that the cans don't actually touch your Dumbos. This allows air flow, preventing clamminess, while still directing the sound to where it needs to go.\nThe music-sharing feature seems a bit odd to me, and having lived in Japan previously, seems very Japanese; I can totally see a group of people in that country all willing to don these headphones in order to throw a party that won't disturb the next door neighbors. But frankly speaking I cannot imagine us inconsiderate Americans taking the trouble.\nThere's no word on whether Sony's Concept N will make it to market, but Imamura is earnestly trying to get the Vie Shairs into production. At press time he'd garnered $78,000-plus in Kickstarter pledges towards a $150,000 goal, and there was still more than a",

I see way too many people biking with headphones and earbuds. The only safe alternative right now are things like Bluetooth speakers which some (not me) might consider a public nuisance.\nAftershokz had a project on Indiegogo for this same purpose. I have a pair of the Aftershokz Trekz Titanium that came as a perk. They are great, highly recommended.\nYou've never done the Silent Disco thing at Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing, where outdoor loudness has to end at 10 pm due to the surrounding residential neighborhood? It's fun but weird, in that you can't talk to anyone else you're bopping to the same music with because of the over-ear headphones.\nHoly cow I never heard of that, that sounds kind of awesome!",

The hood is topped with a body-colored scoop, the grille and lower fascia are black, and round inset fog lamps are standard. Mirrors, door handles, fender flares and rear bumper are color-keyed, and body sides wear \"TRD SPORT\" graphics. Available colors are Barcelona Red Metallic, Black Magnetic Gray Metallic, Nautical Blue Metallic, Pyrite Mica, Spruce Mica and Super White.\nWheels are 17-inch five-spoke alloys, wrapped with lower-profile P265/65R-17 tires (Bridgestone Dueler H/T on the tester), which team with a specifically tuned sport-suspension system with heavy-duty Bilstein shocks.\nPower to the wheels is via a 4.0-liter V-6, delivering 236 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 266 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 rpm, with an Electronic Throttle Control system with intelligence that optimizes performance and fuel efficiency. Estimated fuel economy for the 4x4 test truck with automatic transmission is 16 miles per gallon city and 21 mpg highway.\nAcceleration and towing muscle can be increased with an optional dealer-installed TRD Eaton Roots-type supercharger kit with air-to-liquid intercooler that increases V-6 output to 304 horsepower and 334 lb.-ft. of torque. Priced at $4,500 with the fit kit, the supercharger includes all the hardware for installation. Thanks to the supercharger's self-contained lubrication, it requires no maintenance.\nEquipped with the $650 Tow Package, 4x4 towing capacity is 6,400 pounds. The Tow Package includes a Class-IV receiver hitch, transmission and supplemental oil cooler, heavy-duty battery, seven-pin connector with converter, trailer-sway control and 130-amp alternator. Maximum payload for the 5-foot cargo box is 1,290 pounds.\nAs with all 2013 Tacomas, the cargo box has a durable sheet-molded composite inner bed with tough walls that are 10 percent lighter than steel. Also increasing utility are rail caps, two covered bed-side storage compartments, an integrated deck-rail system with four adjustable tie-downs, a removable tailgate and 115-volt/400-watt deck-mounted power point. A roof-rack system with crossbars that deploy from the roof rails is available on Double Cab models.\nDouble Cabs offer the advantage of large, front-hinged rear doors providing convenient access and egress. The rear seat is 60/40 split with cushions that lift to accommodate larger cargo. Headroom is excellent in the rear and legroom is good to fair, depending on front-seat positioning.

And so it goes at the UN.\nUNITED NATIONS, April 1 -- Amid the self-congratulatory Haiti fest at the UN on Wednesday, there was bragging by the European Union, Canada and others, corporate plugs for Coca-Cola, and many Haitian excluded from the conference.\nThe EU's High Commissioner Catherine Ashton closed with the dramatic phrase about the scale of death \"in 35 seconds.\" But earlier on Wednesday, when Inner City Press asked her about what's described as her powerplay to get EU development aid under an External Affairs Unit she is setting up, she dodged as in a quake. There's no controversy, she said. But that's not what development and poverty experts say.\nInner City Press asked Ashton about two EU members, Germany and France. The former's been called stingy by German Agro Aid. French development minister Alain Joyandet spent over 116,000 Euros taking a private jet to a meeting about poverty in Haiti. Ashton smiled as that question was asked, but did not answer it. The German question she left to her Eastern European co-panelist.\nUpstairs at the stakeout in front of the Trusteeship Council Chamber, high profile participants praised the meeting and themselves. Canadian foreign Minister Cannon lauded his country's response. Inner City Press asked about the criticism by former Canadian (and UN) diplomat Robert Fowler, that the conservative Canadian government has turned more and more inwards, and taken sides in the Middle East.\nCannon said he would not respond to Fowler, only that he is -- and by implication Fowler should be -- grateful to the countries which helped get Fowler released from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, after he was scooped up in Niger working for the UN and perhaps Canadian mining interests.\nBack downstairs the press spokesman of Japan's foreign minister Okada described his boss' trip to Washington, Ottawa and New York in seemingly great detail. But he omitted the discussions of the relocation of American forces on Okinawa. When asked by Inner City Press, he dutifully described the issue for the few representatives of Japanese media in the briefing room, as if they'd never heard of it. And then the briefing was over.\nIt all concluded with an unwieldy seven person press conference in the UN's basement. Only three questions were allowed, each apparently pre-selected. Ban's spokesman called on Spanish wire service EFE, which he had left off Ban's first trip to Haiti, whose president's spokesman called on a Haitian journalist from \"Scoop.\" The U.S. State Department called on Reuters, which asked Hillary Clinton about Iran and the UN Security Council.\nWhile Haitian President Rene Preval rolled his eyes and Ban urged that only Haiti questions be asked, Hillary Clinton, France's Bernard Kouchner and Brazil's foreign minister each answered the question. Brazil said as a non permanent member of the Council, it was not in the loop.\nHillary Clinton said that the U.S. viewed seeking Council sanctions as diplomacy, even negotiations.

        "prompt": "Can two reporters survive on $5 of food a day?\nTwo days worth of food costing $9.99.\nEvery September, hunger groups ask politicians, community leaders and journalists to take a break in their normal diet and try to live on $5 a day, or roughly the amount allotted to users of food stamps (officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP).\nThis year’s “SNAP Challenge” comes as the USDA conducts a rare review of the rules that govern the federal food assistance program. It also coincides with another push by Congress to renew the Farm Bill, which expires on Sept. 30, and ultimately determines how much money is allocated to the program. WBEZ reporter Natalie Moore and producer Monica Eng have been following these developments closely and decided to take the SNAP challenge themselves this year.\nFirst, a few caveats: we know that taking the SNAP challenge for two days is not the same as putting ourselves in the shoes of those who truly rely on the program. Our cooking knowledge, kitchen equipment and access to a car are not shared by all low-income Chicagoans. We also realize that surviving on $5 a day for two days is not the same as doing it for months or even years. And finally, we know that $5 is not a perfect figure for comparison as SNAP funds, in most cases, are supplemented with other income.\nThat said, in the course of a few days we learned a lot about the difficulty of translating these meager funds into healthy, fulfilling meals. We figured out how much extra time and planning this can take, and how many of the daily foods and treats we take for granted suddenly become unavailable when your budget is cut back so severely.\nWe began preparing for the challenge last Saturday at the 61st Street Farmers Market in Woodlawn, where we interviewed real SNAP participants on how they use their money. We chose this particular farmers market to enjoy the “theoretical” benefit of double value for all SNAP purchases up to $25. This is the only market in the city that doubles benefits up to $25 and it was a huge help in",

Shopping with a friend allowed us to split items, for example buying two bunches of kale for $5, instead of $3 a bunch.\nWe continued our shopping at Pete’s Fresh Market in Brighton Park and the Atotonilco Tortilleria and El Guero supermercado in Back of the Yards. These stores offer a greater selection and, in some cases, better deals than many of the substandard convenience stores, liquor stores and gas stations that pepper many of Chicago’s low-income neighborhoods (we hope to address the challenge of using SNAP at those stores down the road).\nIn total, it took us a whopping four hours to shop and plan our meals – and stay on budget. Next, we had to prepare our meals and then, of course, eat them!\nClick on the following links to see our individual grocery lists and food diaries for Monday and Tuesday of this week (Sept. 9-10).",

Industrial discharges of PFOA to the Ohio River, contaminating water systems near Parkersburg, West Virginia, were previously associated with nearby residents’ serum PFOA concentrations above U.S. general population medians.\nAn earlier study looking at samples from girls and young women from Northern Kentucky showed that about half of the samples from the girls were much higher than the national average for U.S. children (the 95th percentile) concentration.\nThe Northern Kentucky Water department has since then implemented the use of granular activated carbon filtration at their plants to meet new federal regulations, and Cincinnati Water Works used the study’s findings to check their treatment regulations and filtration usage.\n\"Where GAC has been used, the blood level concentration of PFOA was decreased significantly (by as much as 60 percent),” said co-author Robert Herrick, a UC doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Health.\nNearly all of the samples tested positive for some level of PFOA (99.9 percent), but 47 percent of the samples had PFOA levels higher than the 95th national",

They are surfactants used in fire-fighting foams and in the manufacture of stain and water resistant coatings, on cookware, furniture and carpeting. As a byproduct of commercial production, PFCs/PFOA are released into the environment and, although no longer used in manufacturing in the U.S., are considered persistent in the environment.\nPinney cites projects like this one as having the translational potential to make improvements in public health.\n\"Studies like these provide evidence to support changes in water treatment practices,” she said.",

Usablenet, which describes itself as a “technology platform for mobile and multichannel customer engagement,” says that when brands on its platform started using HTML5-enabled features like interactive galleries, location services, overlays and expandable (or collapsible) boxes, their pageviews increased by 11% and their bounce rates decreased by 15%.

        "prompt": "Why censure, not impeachment, is the proper way to deal with the president’s misdeeds.\nTo some on the left, Tlaib’s comments seemed not just sensible but long overdue. After all, President Trump has committed impeachable offenses. At a minimum, he has interfered with the ongoing inquiry into Russian election meddling. He has publicly admitted as much, and his numerous tweets on the subject reveal a pattern of obstructing justice. There is also increasing evidence that he colluded with various parties to defraud the American people to win the presidency. We will know more about his offenses when special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concludes his investigation and the House begins its examination of the president’s conduct.\nYet Tlaib’s comments disregard the political reality: Gaining a conviction in the Republican Senate is highly unlikely, and thus far, impeachment remains politically unpopular. This makes it worthwhile for House Democrats to consider an alternative path. Rather than allowing her party to get mired in an impeachment battle that will distract from its progressive message, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could orchestrate a presidential censure. And not just one. House Democrats could adopt a series of censure resolutions, one for each investigation revealing serious misconduct.\nDuring this period, maintaining a central bank was the most controversial policy debate between Jackson’s Democrats, who promoted laissez-faire economics, and Henry Clay’s Whigs, who supported government action to spur economic growth. Jackson said the bank concentrated excessive financial strength in a single institution and served mainly to make the rich even richer, whereas Clay said it was needed to regulate public credit and maintain a stable currency.\nIn addition to presidential censure, Congress has reprimanded more than 30 of its own members. The most famous, and most relevant today, was the censure of Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.). He rose to power in the early 1950s by claiming to know the identities of hundreds of communists who had infiltrated the federal government, academia and Hollywood. As chair of the Senate Government Operations Committee, he pursued an aggressive Red Hunt that lasted for nearly two years. In hearing after hearing, McCarthy resorted to personal smears and innuendo. Few stood up to him because they feared the ire of McCarthy and his millions of supporters.\nHe went too far, however, when he began investigating the military. These hearings were televised nationally, and most Americans didn’t like what they saw as McCarthy bullied distinguished officers. In July 1954, Sen. Ralph Flanders (R-Vt.) introduced a resolution calling for McCarthy’s formal reprimand. The chamber considered 46 claims of misconduct, ultimately settling on two charges: obstruction of justice and conduct contrary to Senate traditions. By a vote of 67 to 22, McCarthy was harshly censured. Although he completed his term in office, his influence vanished. Today, he remains reviled for his abuses of power.\nThere are lessons for Democrats in both these",

Handling Trump’s misdeeds cannot devolve into the equivalent of the Republican-led impeachment of Bill Clinton two decades ago, which strengthened that president more than serving as a punishment. Instead, House Democrats should copy the much more measured methods employed by the Senate when investigating McCarthy. The hearings back then were intended to restore dignity to government by adopting a judicial atmosphere. The focus was on a solemn assessment of misconduct rather than personal animus — the opposite of Tlaib’s impassioned exclamation at a political event.\nWhile impeachment and removal from office would certainly be gratifying, what is more important is to restore the norms of our republic. We cannot tolerate the law breaking that has come to typify the Trump administration. Censuring the president would be a pragmatic approach to undermining President Trump, one that will hopefully result in a historic electoral rebuke of authoritarianism.",

        "prompt": "istockphotoEllie Light has revealed more details about the woman behind the name.\nUPDATE: A man with access to the Ellie Light e-mail account says yes, it's him.\nWASHINGTON -- Ellie Light, the ubiquitous letter writer arousing blogosphere suspicions that she is a White House operative spreading the gospel of Barack Obama, is actually a registered nurse. She lives in a California community near Bakersfield.\nAnd her real name is Barbara Brooks. Or so she told The Plain Dealer today after a series of phone interviews, e-mails and records checks involving Brooks/Light, a family member, licensing records and property information.\nThe 51-year-old woman provided her address on Monday night to The Plain Dealer, and what she says is her real name in conversations today that followed checks of public records.\nThis followed The Plain Dealer's publication on cleveland.com Thursday that a woman using the name Ellie Light was duping newspapers nationwide by giving them \"local\" addresses in letters to the editor that she penned defending President Obama's progress in advancing the Democratic agenda. Many newspapers will not publish letters unless they are from local readers.\nNews of Light's tactics left multiple newspapers embarrassed, with some apologizing to their readers. But it also triggered suspicions in the blogosphere that Ellie Light might not even be real, and that the letter-writing campaign was a duplicitous spin strategy from the Obama White House or the Democratic Party.\nAs for the name: Brooks says she picked \"Ellie Light\" out of the blue. \"It just sort of came to me,\" she said. \"Apparently to everyone else on the Internet, it has much significance.\"\nHer home is in Frazier Park, Calif. She works as a nurse, traveling to assignments throughout the country for lengthy stints. Her travels have made it easy for her to pick addresses to use when sending letters to editors of newspapers, many of whom believed falsely that she lived in their circulation areas.\nShe focused mostly on smaller papers, she said, although she succeeded in reaching larger ones, too, including USA Today and the San Francisco Examiner.\n\"That was by design,\" she said of her small-newspaper strategy, \"because I want to address people who never talk to a liberal. By design, I talk to smaller presses, hoping to get a dialogue going with some of the editors and some of the readers.\"\nA proud Democrat, she said that \"I want to deliberately talk to the enemy\" and \"people deep, deep in the red states.\"\nAs for the addresses she used, some from small communities and suburbs that out-of-towners might not recognize, Light/Brooks said that her job as a traveling nurse made her familiar with communities nationwide. \"I do have friends\" in the communities, and \"I do live all over\" when not at home. \"I've been to probably 20 different hospitals.\"\nIn the telephone interview Monday night, she expressed a mix of amusement and aggravation at the claims she's heard since news of her story -- or what was known of it -- went viral, thanks largely to Drudge Report and other Web sites and then Fox News. She sees little logic in the claims that senior White House advisor David Axelrod is the wizard behind the letters.\n\"If I were part of this sort of Axelrod conspiracy,\" she said, \"I wouldn't be whining about how unpopular Obama is.\"\nAlthough her recent flurry of letters with multiple addresses has drawn recent attention, Light/Brooks said she's expressed her opinion on occasion over a number of years, including a piece on John Kerry during his presidential campaign.\n\"I don't do it often,\" she said. \"I do it when I have something to say.\"\nAs for her politics, she",

I’m your host, Mary Kay Magistad.\nThat point of view has been called unfashionable by some, might be considered wishful thinking by others. In any case, Americans have a long tradition of feeling anxious about their position in the world –- going back to the Founding Fathers, and at many times since.\nTake that quote I read a minute ago. Who did you think it was? Donald Trump? Any number of pundits speaking at any point since the great recession started in 2008, and with it, predictions that China would soon surpass us as the world’s premier superpower – if it hadn’t already?\nThat was publisher Henry Luce, in an essay in Life Magazine, in February 1941. A quick disclaimer – this podcast is funded by a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation – but that’s not why I’m mentioning him here. I’m mentioning him – because this essay mattered at the time it was published. At that point, the Pearl Harbor attack was still months off. America was mostly sitting out War War II. And Luce was trying to rally reluctant Americans to get involved, to accept a mantle of global leadership. His essay was called “The American Century.” It actually popularized the concept ‘The American Century.” Joe Nye dates the beginning of the American century to that same year, when America finally did join the war effort, and emerged at the end of it a superpower.\nChina’s rising, India’s growing fast, many African countries are finding their own successful development paths. The percentage of people around the world living in absolute poverty has plummeted, from 35% a couple of decades ago, to what the World Bank says is likely to be below 10% this year.\nWill we still be the most powerful nation? That’s certainly not the perception, if you look at a survey in 40 countries done by the Pew Research Center this spring. It found that more people than not in most of those countries said China will replace, or has already replaced, the US as leading global superpower.\nNow, it must be said, respondents in some countries felt strongly in the other direction – Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, in particular, said China will never replace the US. Kind of interesting, if you think about it – the US colonized one of those three, and went to war with the other two, and they’re the ones who most want the US to continue to play the role it’s been playing in the world. Easy to see why – each has a territorial dispute with China, and anxiety about what will happen as China continues to flex its muscles, and build up its military presence, in the South China Sea and East China Sea.\nThis is the biggest regional trade accord in history, and it’s been seen in some quarters as a US bid to keep China from claiming its own mantle as preeminent Asian power – one that many Chinese feel is its right to claim. I mean, why should the US be the only power that gets to cite the Monroe Doctrine, about protecting its regional backyard?\nThat’s Liu Yang. He’s a deputy editor at the Global Times newspaper in China. That paper is an interesting hybrid. It comes out both in Chinese and English, it’s under the umbrella of the People’s Daily – the Communist Party’s newspaper – and it can be rather bellicose in its nationalistic proclamations. But it has also been known to do solid investigative reporting on problems within China.\nI chatted with Liu Yang, when he was in the US this summer as an Asia Foundation fellow – he went around to US think tanks, and listened to what American scholars had to say about China’s rise.\nThat kind of candor is kind of refreshing. Still – there are plenty of people in China – and in the Chinese military – who do want China to play a more prominent global role, who say this is already the Chinese Century.\nBut – the Chinese government has shown itself to be a little conflicted when it comes to walking that talk.\nNow, to be fair, while hundreds of millions of Chinese have pulled themselves out of poverty, a couple hundred million are still beneath the World Bank’s poverty line. Even so, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced, while he was visiting the US last month, that China will give $2 billion in aid to developing countries, and will spend $3 billion more to combat climate change.\nAMB 1: Bring up sound of gleeful shouting.\n…By saturation coverage of Pope Francis, and the cheering crowds who turned out to see him everywhere he went. This was in DC – where the Pope went over to the crowd, shook a bunch of hands, and posed for selfies with delighted children. And that brings us back to Joe Nye, and the concept of soft power – which he defines as the power to get what you want through attraction, rather than through coercion, or payment.\nIn other words –he’s saying -- authenticity matters. So does appealing to what people actually care about.\nThey go on to say – the Chinese public calls him “Xi Dada,” – Uncle Xi.\nI like the touch of using “Take Me Home, Country Roads’ as background music here – a little soft power ricochet. John Denver was one of the first American singers to visit China, during the reform and opening up period. A surprising number of Chinese still know all the words to this tune. The makers of this video apparently believed it would resonate as much with Americans now as it did with Chinese, then.\nSo – give Xi Jinping soft power points for knowing that making a few cultural references can make a crowd feel closer to you. In fact, he’s done this often. He has cited Russian authors when he has visited Russia, French in France, German in Germany.\nStill – cultural pandering only goes so far, in terms of soft power, when the crowd also knows that Xi’s government has moved aggressively to limit free speech, has increased censorship and control of the internet, has detained feminists demonstrating against domestic violence, and lawyers who take on civil rights cases. That same Pew survey I mentioned earlier, found that in Germany and France, more than 90 percent of those surveyed said the Chinese government doesn’t respect the personal freedoms of its people.\nSo – what’s a rising authoritarian superpower to do?\nThat may well change in the future, but it’s hard for Chinese universities to compete, in areas that require critical thinking, when Xi Jinping’s government has instructed Chinese universities not to use so many Western textbooks, or teach or even talk about such Western concepts as civil society, democracy, or rule of law.

But in fiscal 2018, adjusted gross revenues are expected to decline ~3% on-year, given the drastic reduction effected by incumbents in voice and data tariffs to counter RJio’s onslaught.\nIn fiscal 2019, growth is expected to rebound to 12-14% on-year, led by data traffic growth, as well as incumbents' focus on high revenue generating 4G subscribers.\nThe reduction in data tariffs since the launch of RJio has led to a free fall in average data realisation per MB from ~20 paisa per MB as of September 2016, to ~2 paisa per MB as of September 2017. Growth hereon is expected to be volume-driven, with data traffic estimated to rise 3x on-year in fiscal 2018, though in 2019, the high base will tamp it down to ~30%.\nThe industry’s operating margin is expected to contract to ~27% in fiscal 2019 from 31.7% in fiscal 2017. Reduction in interconnect usage charges by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, coupled with increase in network operations cost on account of expansion in 4G infrastructure and coverage, amid pricing pressures will lead to this decline.\n4G subscriber additions are gaining momentum, while 2G and 3G are on the decline. Increasingly, this will also open up space for spectrum, which is being used for 2G/3G services, to be used for 4G services. Thus, players are focusing on devising 4G-led strategies for providing a better experience, leading to high data usage, and thereby revenue. 4G subscribers would account for ~ 30% of total subscribers in fiscal 2019 higher from 11% by end of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 witnessed a series of consolidation and exits in the industry. Bharti Airtel is acquiring the consumer mobile business of Tata Teleservices, which will give it access to the latter’s ~190 MHz spectrum and bolster 4G coverage. Also, RCom has also agreed to sell off its wireless asset to RJio, which will strengthen the latter's position in the industry as it will acquire spectrum in an efficient band of 800/900 MHz from RCom. Aircel has decided to halt its services in six circles as well by the end of January 2018. Idea and Vodafone are in the process of completing their merger which can create the largest telecom player for India.\nThe Telecom Commission’s decision",
        "baseline": " to relax spectrum holding cap in Jan 2018 is likely to speed up the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. It will also ease the announced acquisition of RCom’s spectrum by RJio. It will help existing smaller players to exit non-viable circles by selling spectrum to stronger players as well, and consolidate their position in only profit-earning circles. Additionally, an increase in deferred payment period from 10 years to 16 years will lower the spectrum payment outgo of the industry by ~Rs 105 billion in fiscal 2019 and by ~Rs 500 billion cumulative until fiscal 2022.

        "prompt": "NEW YORK (AP) — Shoes are coming out of the closet and landing under the Christmas tree. They’re a top seller this holiday season — a big feat considering most years they don’t even make gift lists.\nLaranda Williams, 39, used to buy clothing, tools and electronics as presents for her family. This year, though, she looked at their feet and got inspired. She bought some Vans sneakers for one of her sons, two pairs of stilettos for a girlfriend of another son, and Nike running shoes for her husband.\nThe shoe-gifting fetish is part of a larger trend of shoppers buying loved ones gifts that they not only like, but also can use. It’s this habit of practicality that Americans have been clinging to throughout the economic downturn.\nThis holiday season, it’s meant that mom might not buy Molly an extravagant evening gown she’ll maybe wear once. But mom may splurge on $600 Jimmy Choo pumps if Molly needs work shoes or $150 Nike sneakers if her daughter’s an avid runner.\nAs a result, footwear was the fifth most popular gift on shoppers’ lists on the day after Thanksgiving known as Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, according to NPD. A year ago, shoes didn’t even make it into the top 10 gifts for the season.\nOverall, sales of cross training shoes rose 16 percent to $197.8 million, and sales of basketball shoes rose 18.7 percent to $353.5 million for the three months ending in November. During that same period, sales of women’s fashion footwear grew 3.2 percent to $6.12 billion.\nChelsey Gates, manager of Chuckies New York, a designer shoe store on the Manhattan borough of New York City, said she’s seen more men buying shoes for the women in her life. One of the most popular gifts: Chelsea Paris gold trim ankle-high boots for $695.\n“Men come in with cards with perfect instructions: style numbers, sizes and prices,” she said.\nThe trend comes as stores have been trying to find ways to boost sales of shoes, which can carry profit margins of up to 50 percent.\nAs part of Macy’s overhaul of its New York flagship store, the department store combined three different shoe departments and expanded their overall size by 10 percent. The new department has 250,000 pairs of shoes, including everything from $99 Nine West leopard print platform pumps to $400 Donald Pliner multi-colored pumps.\n“Women love shoes. This is a category that they care about,” said Muriel Gonzalez, an executive vice president at Macy’s.\nThis fall, Saks Fifth Avenue also beefed up shoe departments in about a dozen of its stores. The move continues the luxury retailer’s efforts at its flagship New York City store, which it first expanded in 2007 to include more shoes, better service and more stock room capability.\nThe flagship shoe department, which got a second remake this fall, now takes over the 8th floor, which previously also housed a gift area. The department, which is 40 percent larger, now is the second most productive department in terms of sales per square foot, behind the main floor, which sells cosmetics.\nIn the past few weeks, Elizabeth Kanfer, Saks’ senior fashion and co-brand director for women’s accessories, said the retailer has noticed boyfriends or husbands walking in with their significant others and buying a pair of shoes that cost at least $595. She declined to offer sales figures.\nEven smaller chains are trying to cash in on the trend. Fleet Feet Sports-Chicago, a two-store chain of running and fitness apparel, launched a gift registry this year that allows people to record their preferred brand, style, color, size, width and model of",
        "baseline": " shoe from hundreds of options.\nCatherine Moloznik, Fleet Feet’s product manager, said so far in December, shoe sales are up about 20 percent compared with a year ago, in part because of the registry.\nOwen Badillo, 35, certainly never thought of buying shoes as gifts for others in the past. But this season he bought two pairs of $30 Asics running shoes for his 28-year-old sister, who’s a mother of two small children and a runner.\nBadillo said he’s more confident in his gift this year than last year when he ran around trying to pick up clothes for his sister, not really knowing “what she wanted.” This year, he said it was clear what she needed.\n“Her shoes are all torn up. So I am focusing on what she really needs,” said Badillo, who lives in Oklahoma City and works at an oil and gas company.",

        "prompt": "The mother of missing airman Corrie McKeague, who vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds nearly four weeks ago, says ‘somebody else’ must be involved in his disappearance.\nIn her first national TV interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Nicola Urquhart urged anyone to come forward who may have seen her 23-year-old son who was last spotted on CCTV in Brentgovel Street at about 3.20am on September 24.\nPolice say they have yet to find images of him leaving town, though he told at least one person he planned to walk the 10 miles back to RAF Honington, as he often did.\nShe said of CCTV footage: “Corrie walks just to the back of shops, it’s where deliveries are made, it’s a dead end, it doesn’t go anywhere.\n“Corrie is quite clearly on CCTV seen walking in the middle of the road into this loading bay where vehicles and bins and stuff are.\n“He never gets seen coming back out, there’s not one image of Corrie on CCTV in the entire area of Bury that’s been captured. It would take an expert months of preparation to be able to evade that and Corrie wasn’t trying to.\n“He has just vanished and as a police officer I know that doesn’t happen but the police have been fantastic. They’ve shown me everything they’ve been doing.\nAsked if there was any reason to think Corrie would want to get away, Nicola, from Dunfermline, said: “I know that would be an easy answer and I wish it was because then at least I would think it was something Corrie has chosen to do.\n“There was nothing going on in his life, there was no major event, there was nothing that might cause him to suddenly think at 3am after he’s had a drink, a week before payday, when he’s left his little seven-month-old puppy in his room, he’s been sending photographs to friends.\nShe said she believed her son was still alive and there are three possibilities of what has happened to him including that there has been a ‘dreadful accident’.\n“This is one of the things I am clinging to. Corrie would go with a stranger in a car, he would ask a stranger for a lift, he would equally pick up hitchhikers so perhaps somebody has given him a lift to try to get him back to the base but they’ve taken him to the wrong place and they’ve dropped him off and they feel bad and they don’t want to come forward.\n“But the police don’t know where to search because they’ve searched the road back to the base and he’s not there.\nShe said he could have left voluntarily but there was ‘no preparation whatsoever, no motivating factor to make him go, his life is really going well for him’.\nThe alternative was that ‘he has been taken against his will’.\nTo those who have any information and feel they can’t come forward and the impact it’s having on the family, an emotional Nicola said: “What would they do if it was their son, if it was their child? How would they be feeling? This is just unbearable.\nNicola is due to appear in the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme this morning at 10.30am and Corrie’s brother Darroch and uncle Tony Wringe appeared on Sky News yesterday afternoon.\nMore than three weeks",

Burbank [was] coming in 0-1 [in league] and we were coming in 1-0, the last three years we've tied with Burbank in league, so it feels like a playoff atmosphere and we were fortunate to pull it off in the end.\"\nDavis Dragovich, whose 20 points tied with Christian Misi for the team lead, opened the second overtime with a strong move inside for a 60-58 advantage and Dylan Kilgour put Crescenta Valley up, 63-60, moments later with an open three-pointer from the left side created by a fallen Burbank defender.\nChris White, who singlehandedly kept Burbank afloat in the second overtime with eight of his game-high 21 points, scored on an offensive rebound and finish to pull the Bulldogs back within 64-62 with two minutes left.\nThe Bulldogs (9-6, 0-2) employed an effective full-court press for most of the game, and it worked especially well down the stretch, but the Falcons were able to break it and get the ball to Misi for a layup and a 66-62 lead with 1:37 to play.\n\"We just executed our stuff,\" Dragovich said. \"Coach draws up good plays in timeouts and we just try to execute. We practice the pressure every day in practice, so we knew how to handle it.\"\nWhite scored easily again to keep Burbank within a basket and the Bulldogs got a stop at the other end, but Andre Spight misfired on three-pointer with 30 seconds left and Misi corralled the rebound.\nDragovich hit one of two free throws to push the lead to three and rather than attempt another three for the tie, the Bulldogs elected for the higher-percentage shot in another White layup with 16 seconds remaining.\nOnce again, it was Dragovich on the line, and this time he made good on both. The three-point lead stood when Burbank's Tyron Bennett's three-pointer in the final seconds was off the mark.\nCrescenta Valley started the game out on fire from three-point range, knocking down an eye-popping eight of nine attempts, with Misi making his first four. But the Falcons still only led by six at the end of the quarter and Burbank had tied the game at 30 by halftime.\n\"The three pointers are like fool's gold,\" said Zargarian, whose team",
        "baseline": " went three for 11 from beyond the arc after the first period. \"We made so many threes in that first quarter and we fell in love with it. I think we kind of kept shooting and went away from attacking the basket, which is not going to work.\"\nThe Falcons worked the lead back up to 43-35 with 45 seconds left in the third period when Cole Currie converted on a runner with the shot clock running down. From there, Crescenta Valley went into a four-plus minute slump that eventually allowed Burbank to tie the game.\nA two-point Crescenta Valley lead was nullified when Spight drove to the basket, was stripped by Davis, but somehow got the loose ball back and got a shot up and in all in one motion.\nCrescenta Valley subsisted on just two free throws in the first overtime, but held Burbank to just one basket and forced the second overtime when Adam Colman's late three-pointer rimmed out.",

        "prompt": "Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest corporate oil producer, will unlikely reduce its exports to the West following the suspension of its crude shipments through the Bab Al Mandeb strait in the Red Sea, in the wake of attacks on Saudi crude carriers by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, analysts said.\n“Overall Saudi export volumes should not be reduced by this decision, although there will be some short-term disruptions and the announcement has created concerns in the crude market and related areas such as shipping insurance,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst with consultancy Energy Aspects in London.\nAramco announced this week it was temporarily halting shipping oil though the Red Sea choke point after Houthis attacked two very large crude carriers on Wednesday, each with a capacity of 2 million barrels and operated by Saudi shipper Bahri, causing minor damage but no injuries to crew.\nAramco said on last Thursday, it took the decision to halt exports through the waterway to protect its crew and avoid oil spills, adding it would continue to assess the situation.\nWith a width of 28.9 kilometres at its narrowest point, Bab Al Mandeb is an important route for oil tankers coming from the Arabian Gulf heading to the Suez Canal or the 322km-long Sumed pipeline that transports oil through Egypt from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Energy Information Administration of the US.\nAround 5.8 million barrels per day of crude and refined products were transported through Bab Al Mandeb in 2016, mainly headed to Europe and the United States, up from 3.3m bpd in 2011, according to the EIA.\n“Should the suspension continue much longer, they can either pipe those volumes from eastern Saudi through their East/West pipeline to Yanbu (",

It will mean six new staff members working in inspection and bylaw enforcement, on top of a staff of 24.\nACORN endorsed the plan, but said the city should hire more than six new staff members, work out stiffer fines for landlords and move quickly towards a visible ranking system, similar to the city’s DineSafe program.\nThey also want stronger outreach so tenants know how to get inspectors inside their units.\nIn May, Simpson spoke with the Star’s Laurie Monsebraaten about her more than decade-long wait for a rent-geared-to-income bachelor or one-bedroom apartment in the west end. High rent meant she was barely scraping by.\nAt City Hall a good part of the meeting was occupied by the debate over whether the registration fee would be passed on to tenants.\nDaryl Chong, president and chief executive officer of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association, maintained his position that the city’s existing inspection tools, coupled with provincial legislation, were",
        "baseline": " sufficient.\nCouncillor Josh Matlow challenged Chong for using “misleading rhetoric,” at the meeting and in a June advertising campaign sponsored by the association and where the fee was described as an apartment tax.\nWhen asked to weigh in, the city’s lawyer agreed there are “limited avenues” for the fee — which he clarified is not a tax — to be passed on to tenants and that the provincial rules surrounding that are very clear.\nCity staff had been tasked to evaluate the value of a licensing system, but determined tougher regulations would be enough to protect renters, without too much red tape.\nThe current plans proposed collecting data on rental buildings through audits and inspections and then exploring the merits of a program like DineSafe. A motion filed by Matlow asking that staff evaluate the prospect of the sign system and report back in late 2017 did not pass.\nHe returned after a few minutes.\nCity Council is scheduled to start on Dec 13.",

All they are doing is telling the police to keep their hands off.\"\nAs voters go to the polls Tuesday to decide if they want California to be the first to legalize recreational pot use and sales, the medical marijuana system they helped establish in 1996 has effectively become a legal cover to smoke pot.\nThe system also stands as a cautionary example for other states crafting their own laws. Among them are Arizona and South Dakota, which have medical marijuana on Tuesday&apos;s ballot.\nUnder California&apos;s law, medical doctors and osteopaths can recommend the drug for any illness \"for which marijuana provides relief,\" a category that has come to encompass conditions such as alcoholism, anxiety, asthma and insomnia.\nObtaining approval in the other 13 states that allow pot for medical use is far more difficult.\nThose states limit the drug to residents suffering from one or more specific serious conditions, such as AIDS or cancer. Most require patients to register, creating a paper trail for tracking both users and their physicians.\nIn California, however, there is no central database to track doctors or patients. Beyond a medical license, the pot physicians do not need to have any relevant training, familiarity with the scientific literature on pot&apos;s benefits and side-effects or special certification.\nThey can simply hang a shingle, and start practicing.\nBecause there are no reporting requirements, figuring out who these doctors are is difficult.\nThere are more than 100,000 licensed doctors in the state, and medical marijuana advocates estimate that roughly 1,500 of them have recommended pot to at least one patient.\nOf those, advocates say, 400 to 500 doctors account for the majority of recommendations.\nTo identify them, The Associated Press scoured online directories maintained by marijuana advocacy groups; ads in alternative weeklies and pot-themed periodicals; and clinic websites. Interviews with clinic managers or doctors who own the clinics provided additional names.\nThe AP&apos;s list of 233 doctors is not exhaustive, nor can it be, given the lack of information with the state.\nAn analysis of the names and state medical board files showed that most marijuana doctors on the list have clean records.\nBut there were also 68 physicians who have run afoul of regulators. Some of the disciplinary actions against them included fraud, mis-prescribing drugs, abusing prescription or illicit drugs themselves, as well as and negligence.\n— A San Francisco doctor who received four years probation after she failed to heed a psychiatrist&apos;s request to reconsider her marijuana recommendation to a 19-year-old patient suffering from depression. The patient committed suicide six months later. The doctor now operates medical marijuana practices in eight cities. She declined to discuss the case.\n— A Glendale obstetrician-gynecologist who pleaded guilty last year to billing Medicare for $77,000 worth of diagnostic tests he never performed while working in Texas. Since moving to Los Angeles, he helped set up pot evaluation offices in 11 locations. He said that moving to California and becoming a medical marijuana doctor was not related to his criminal case.\n— A Fresno osteopath who was arrested in June 2008 for driving under the influence of alcohol and whose urine tested positive for marijuana, anti-anxiety drugs and a prescription stimulant. Two months later, he was arrested again for driving with a suspended license and involuntarily hospitalized as a suicide risk. He was convicted in both cases, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency revoked his authority to prescribe narcotics. He is now giving pot recommendations at his private practice. His attorney said he declined to comment.\n\"It doesn&apos;t surprise me people who would be in trouble before are now turning to something that is easy, doesn&apos;t require staff privileges at a hospital and doesn&apos;t require malpractice insurance,\" David Thornton, the state medical board&apos;s former executive director.\n\"All they need is a medical license and places that will hire them,\" he said.\nSupporters of medical marijuana stress that, unlike physicians prescribing pharmaceutical drugs, pot doctors are not enabling people to use a potentially fatal substance. But they acknowledge that some doctors abuse their authority to extend pot-using privileges.\n\"We have standards to uphold. I really try to uphold those standards,\" said Dr. Jean Talleyrand, founder of MediCann Inc., the state&apos;s largest chain of medical marijuana evaluation clinics. \"There are a lot of doctors who are not upholding those standards.\"\nClinics typically charge $50 to $150 per visit for new patients. Seeing 10 patients a day, pot doctors can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Some battle it out for customers with ads in alternative newsweeklies offering discounts for older patients and two-for-one specials.\nStill, many pot doctors maintain low profiles.\nThey work at one or more of 140-plus clinics that opened in the last few years, only a handful of which identify their physicians in marketing materials. Some of the largest clinics, including Talleyrand&apos;s, declined requests from the AP to give their staff doctors&apos; names.\nEven as the number of these doctors has soared into the hundreds, the risk of getting in trouble for improper recommendations is low.\nThe state medical board and the companion panel that polices osteopaths have restricted the licenses of 13 pot doctors, about one per year, since the landmark law&apos;s passage. Two had their licenses revoked, the most serious discipline available.\nDisciplinary action is rare because the state board lacks the staff and launches investigations when complaints are brought, said Julie D&apos;Angelo Fellmeth, a University of California, San Diego law professor who spent two years as the board&apos;s independent enforcement monitor.\nThe people they rely upon to submit those complaints are patients.\nThey \"are not going to be filing the complaints,\" she said. \"They are happy as clams.\"\nAnother reason the doctors may avoid scrutiny is because investigators focus on areas of medicine that are viewed as a greater threat to public safety — incompetent surgeons or physicians who over-prescribe painkillers on which patients can overdose, Thornton said.\nCurrent medical board officials declined to be interviewed for this article, but said in answers to written questions that the agency gives medical marijuana practitioners the same scrutiny as other doctors, even though it has inadequate staff to closely monitor them.\nUnder California law, physicians who prescribe controlled substances such as painkillers must report all such prescriptions to a central state database each week.\nMarijuana does not fall under this requirement because as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law — a drug the federal government says has no medical value — it cannot legally be prescribed, only recommended.\nTo avoid state scrutiny, doctors need to only follow a few simple rules — review patients&apos; prior medical records for proof of the existing ailment, perform \"good faith\"",
        "baseline": " physicals, develop treatment plans, and talk to them about the risks and potential side effects of using pot.\nBut dispensary owners, patients and practitioners say even those guidelines are routinely ignored, or at least pushed to the limits.\nIn Los Angeles, the situation got so out-of-control this year that the city&apos;s pot shops stopped selling to about 30,000 customers with paperwork from 10 doctors at three clinics. Two closed, almost overnight. The third changed its telephone number and location after being swarmed by angry customers demanding refunds.\nMichael Backes, director of the Cornerstone Collective, said he put together and circulated a list of doctors to other pot shops after noticing people trying to join the co-op with suspicious-looking physicians&apos; approvals.\n\"We started to notice a lot of recommendations that weren&apos;t even signed by physicians anymore,\" he said. \"They were rubber-stamped, literally rubber-stamped.\"",

        "prompt": "Chicago artist Noname will be gracing The Sylvee’s stage this Saturday, having recently released her first album, Room 25.\nNoname is a spoken word poet, singer, rapper and performer who blends hip-hop, jazz, neo-soul and poetry into her music. Her style is unique and unmistakable as she fluctuates seamlessly between speaking and singing while delivering quotable, poetic lyricism.\nNoname gained traction in the music industry by featuring on music with fellow Chicagoans Chance the Rapper and Mick Jenkins. Her first mixtape, Telefone, received critical acclaim from FADER magazine, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. The quality and success of Telefone positioned Noname as not only one of the best artists of our generation but one of the most stylistically unique modern artists.\nNoname’s music includes socially conscious lyricism, and her ability to capture feelings in her poetic speech. She almost seems to be dancing lightheartedly around the instrumental with her poetry, but never wastes a word as she tackles subjects like poverty, and the struggles of growing up as a black woman in Chicago. While these were both prominent themes on Telefone, Noname balances sadness in her music with hope and inspiration.",

It is clear on her newest project that she is no longer trying to find her voice in the music industry, but rather asserting and allowing herself to enjoy the pleasures of life and talk about them unapologetically. Room 25 is more instrumentally experimental and lyrically refined, but the fact that it lives up to — even exceeds — the quality of Telefone is a massive achievement.\nThe Noname performance in Madison is bound to be an evening full of emotion, laughter, and awe at her poetic talent. If the show happens as expected, the audience will leave The Sylvee with a heightened appreciation of spoken-word, and a general sense of happiness that we’ve witnessed the performance of a legend in the making.",

But now he'll likely have to begin attacking Kasich to keep consolidating support.\nHOUSTON — Ted Cruz continued to cast himself as the last remaining viable alternative to Donald Trump on Tuesday, inviting Marco Rubio supporters to join his campaign and casting himself as the sole authentic conservative left.\nIt’s a sign of the up-is-down nature of the Republican presidential race that Cruz is able to make this argument despite not having won a state on Tuesday night (as of this writing, the Missouri primary had still not been called).\nIt’s true that Cruz has won more states than any other non-Trump candidate. But the fact remains that Trump still has by far the best shot of winning the nomination outright, and while tonight’s John Kasich win in Ohio increased the chances of a contested convention, it did not help to clear the path for Cruz.\n“Tonight was a good night. Tonight we continued to gain delegates to continue our march to 1,237,” Cruz said on Tuesday, speaking to a small crowd of supporters gathered in a Houston hotel ballroom with a cash bar.\n“To those who supported Marco, who worked so hard, we welcome you with open arms,” Cruz said.\nAnd he drew contrasts with Trump, asking the crowd, “Do you want a candidate who shares your values or a candidate who has spent decades opposing your values?\"\nThe Cruz campaign still say that they can get to 1,237 delegates and win the nomination outright, but there is growing acknowledgement that a contested convention could be in the works.\nThe continued presence of Kasich in the race makes the entire process more complicated — and Cruz’s path to a one-on-one battle with Trump further away.\nThe Cruz campaign will likely have to start dealing with Kasich, someone who hasn’t much attracted their attention before this beyond Cruz encouraging voters who were considering voting for Rubio or Kasich to vote for him. Cruz campaign chief strategist Jason Johnson hinted at this when speaking with reporters after Cruz’s event on Tuesday.\nJohnson even called Kasich a “spoiler,” saying “there are only two people who actually have a viable path” to the nomination.\nCruz, who often says that conservatives are “coalescing” around his campaign, did start seeing some",
        "baseline": " coalescing in the past two weeks. The campaign rolled out a surprise endorsement from Carly Fiorina, and also snagged the endorsement of Sen. Mike Lee — Cruz’s first Senate endorsement — and National Review, the august conservative publication.\nKasich staying in could dilute some of that coalescing, just as Cruz was starting to build tentative bridges with Republican establishment figures — Neil Bush, for example, has endorsed Cruz. And tensions with the establishment remain high. CNN reported on Tuesday that some Republican senators want Cruz to apologize to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before they will consider supporting his candidacy.\nThe Cruz team continues to project confidence going forward into the next contests, sticking to the two-man-race narrative.\nThe memo posits that the map going forward favors Cruz because most of the upcoming states are closed primaries, where he does well compared to Trump’s dominating open primaries. And it predicts strong Cruz performances in Utah, Wisconsin, and the June 7 primaries.",

        "prompt": "With unprecedented intimacy and frequency, Americans are becoming witnesses to murder.\nWith the videos of beheadings and the footage of Black people being murdered by police, we’ve begun watching real people die violently in real-time, often from the palm of our hands or from the screens in our laps. Most recently, we streamed the disturbing body camera footage of Sam Dubose’s murder on our phones. We watched video of Tamir Rice’s death, transforming untold scores of people surfing social media into witnesses of the real-life murder of a child. We saw in unedited and gruesome detail the beheadings of innocents at the hands of extremists.\nBy now, almost all of us are witnesses to a murder. Many of us have seen more than one murder. Some of us have watched dozens.\nTake a moment and think about the past year.\nHow many people have you watched be murdered?\nHow many people have you watched die violently?\nThe numbers can be staggering. While some say they refuse to watch any of the videos, many I spoke with say they have watched at least 3 to 5 people murdered this year. Still more count 10, 20, or higher.\nWhat’s troubling, though, is how little reflection I’ve seen people of faith give this development. While there is plenty of concern about fictional violence in the media, less has been said about the real-life violence people now have access to at the tips of their fingers.\nImagine for a moment one of your friends, parishioners or fellow church members witnessed a violent murder. Now imagine they had witnessed a half-dozen or more murders in the span of a year. You would be rightfully concerned about their emotional well-being, wanting to provide them as much spiritual care as possible, visiting with them, listening to them, and praying with them. You might even encourage them to seek counseling.\nGiven increasing ubiquity and frequency of these videos, it is time to start thinking seriously about and discussing honestly the psychological trauma that can come from watching people be murdered. Now, before dismissing this post as one giant experiment in concern trolling, even researchers and scientific studies suggest that watching these kinds of videos can cause many of the same symptoms we see in people with post-traumatic stress disorder. In fact, one study found that repeated exposure to videos and stories in the media of a traumatic event like the Boston Marathon Bombing can cause more lasting psychological trauma than the people in the community where the tragic events took place.\nNow, many religious folks might prefer to debate whether we should watch these videos. Some might say it desensitizes us to violence. Others will say it sensitizes us to ongoing violence and injustice we have previously been ignoring. But I’m honestly more interested in the effects of watching than the ethics. As people of faith, we don’t need a prescriptive response but a pastoral one. These videos aren’t thought experiments in a classroom but real life and real violence..\nAnd these videos aren’t going anywhere either. People aren’t going to stop watching them. They are part of our new normal. In fact, with the rise in body cameras for police officers, we will likely see more not less of them. Not only are these kinds of videos poised to become more frequently and more readily available in the future, but there may well be increasing pressure to watch them as they fill social media.\nSo instead of telling people to watch or not to watch these kinds of videos, I think we would be better off helping each other make healthy, informed choices and provide support to those who are emotionally raw because of these videos.\nAs religious people, we can remind people that the decision to watch videos of murder is a serious one. Not because it is inherently right or wrong but because it does affect us psychologically and emotionally. It’s is not the same as clicking on a funny cat video on Facebook. It is not entertainment, something to view to while away some free time.\nBy clicking on one of these videos, we are consciously choosing to watch a person be murdered when we do not have to. Interrogate our reasons for doing so, if we haven’t already. Encourage people to take the time to pray or meditate about whether to become witnesses to (another) murder. And help them be prepared for what it might do to them emotionally or spiritually.\nWatching the traumatic death of someone will leave a mark on a person as well. If choosing to watch these videos, be aware of the symptoms of secondary or vicarious psychological trauma. Consider talking to a counselor, a pastor, spiritual director, or a psychiatrist, especially taking into consideration the cumulative nature of all these videos over the past year. Find (or offer if you are a religious leader!) a private support group to process emotionally in a safe space.\nIn other words, before choosing to watch these videos, ask how we will care for ourselves, both in the short-term and long. Ask ourselves what we will do with the images we consume of someone’s death. And if we don’t have good answers or haven’t even thought about it at all, then perhaps we should reconsider clicking play for the moment.\nIt is a choice to become a witness to murder. No one has to watch these videos to be fully informed and fully outraged by it all.\nBut even if we are among those who don’t chose to watch these videos, we must be aware that many, many people are choosing to watch. Many are choosing to be witnesses to violent murder and executions. And many of them might be or will be traumatized by it.\nSo look around your social media feeds and timelines, your communities and your cities, your family and your friends, and your church and in your pews. Consider for a moment just how many witnesses to murder you probably know. Think about the emotional and spiritual burden of witnessing the violent death of another human. Those images and the feelings associated with them just don’t go away.\nHow can we respond in a more healthy way to people who have experienced trauma?\nHow can we take seriously the trauma of being murder witnesses?\nHow should the church respond to the trauma so many are experiencing from these videos?\nI’ve long been convinced that the church needs to be a place that calls people to protest and prophetic action on issues like police",
        "baseline": " violence and violence against people of color. But I’m becoming more and more convinced that even as it calls for action the church also needs to be a deeply pastoral place of healing, restoration, and support for the trauma and emotional damage that might come with such prophetic action. In fact, offering a pastoral place for processing the effects of witnessing the videos of these murders might actually open up spaces to encourage constructive and prophetic responses in ways simply preaching and teaching on police violence can’t.\nWithout a doubt, the church needs to be forming more than protestors, activists, and accomplices.\nMaybe, in the face of witnessing such trauma, it also needs to be forming chaplains and building safe spaces as well.\nBecause with unprecedented frequency and intimacy, Americans are becoming mass witnesses to murder.\nAnd, by and large, we aren’t even talking about it.\nAugust 27, 2015 Questioning Prayer: Why Should I Keep Praying After Yet Another Shooting?",

Of course, he has a right to think he can turn things around as the dynamic between actors Finn Jones and Mike Colter has been one of the few positive things Marvel Netflix Universe fans have liked about the Iron Fist. Colter has confirmed Luke Cage Season 2 will embrace that fan love and play out a mini Heroes For Hire arc with the two heroes.\nCheo Coker's desire to transform people's perception of the hero Iron Fist is likely fine with Marvel, as Iron Fist Season 1 had some of the roughest reviews for a Marvel Netflix series to date. That said, audiences were far kinder than critics when it came to the series and unofficial data regarding the show's streaming numbers alleged it was one of the most streamed shows of 2017 at the time. Should Coker, who shared the statement in an upcoming interview with All Hip Hop TV, change people's perception of Rand too much, there's always that chance that they alienate the audience that saw no problem with the hero to begin with.\nThat said, there's a lot of ways Che",

Harlem as a setting has done a lot to stylize the character of Luke Cage, so perhaps witnessing Rand walking its streets as opposed to the world of corporate America and K'un-Lun will allow audiences to see a different side of Iron Fist. Additionally, Danny's likely a better Iron Fist than he was in his last two outings, so there will certainly be a lot more of him being useful as opposed to exhausted after throwing one glowing punch.\nLuke Cage Season 2 premieres on Netflix Friday, June 22 at 12:01 AM PT.

The erection of visa barriers responds to a number of factors, though it can be said without too many qualifications that the citizens of rich countries tend to have a much easier time accessing the world visa-free than do the citizens of poor countries.\nThe Henley Visa Restrictions Index Global Ranking 2011, excerpted in the Economist last week, was just published by Henley & Partners, an international law firm specializing in “international residence and citizenship planning.” Henley & Partners divide the world into 223 countries and territories.\nAnd who gets to travel with few visa restrictions? The best citizenships for visa-free travel belong to nationals of Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, at 173 apiece. On their Nordic heels is Germany at 172 and a mess of countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom) at 171. The United States isn’t too far down the list, tied in fifth place with Ireland at 169. The US comes in ahead of Switzerland (167), Canada (164), New Zealand (166), and Australia (166).\nSome of the least lucky countries, according to the Henley Visa Restrictions Index survey: India (53), China (40), Iran (36), Lebanon (33), and Afghanistan (24).\nI recently found myself entangled in a linguistic chess match with a Luxembourg waitress.\nOn a morning stroll of the cobbled avenue that comprises the city of Echternach’s main thoroughfare, the sight of white foam cresting over frosty, oversized beer steins unintentionally drew me to a corner table of an outdoor café. Though a mere 90 minutes had passed since finishing my morning coffee, the lust for some local imbibing had suddenly trumped my desire to explore.\nAs the blonde waitress casually approached my corner table, I mentally prepared myself for the verbal jigsaw puzzle Luxembourg frequently forced me to construct. Anxiously eying her smiling young face, something about her leisurely stride tipped the scales towards going with French. I decided to strike first.\n“Bonjour”, I offered, my American accent completely butchering the romance of it.\n“Gutentag”, she shot back, her blonde curls bouncing as she took the final step.\nUgh. German Not my strong suit.\n“Gutentag. Bitte ein bier” I countered. (Everyone at least learns how to ask for a beer).\n“Oui, une bière” came the half-expected French reply.\nShe was catering to me. I was catering to her. We had danced a full circle.\nBefore I could internally translate my next thought, however, I was unexpectedly struck by a hailstorm of guttural syllables. Luxembourgish: a language I didn’t even know existed until I had entered the country three days prior.\n“Big”, I sheepishly guessed, my reply in English. We had finally succumbed to our Mother tongues.\n“Oui”, she giggled, her blonde locks dancing off in the direction of my incoming beer.And so begins another day in Echternach, a city of 4500 people on the banks of Luxembourg’s Sauer River. Officially, Luxembourg is the world’s only Grand Duchy, though I’m still unsure exactly what that entails. From the marked difference between the opposing banks of the Sauer River, I’m guessing it has something to do with acting remarkably aristocratic. On the other side of the Sauer lies Germany, its riverbank populated by large trailer parks and dingy flea markets. Here on the Echternach side of things, however, there are manicured walking trails and sprawling historical gardens. I figure the difference must have to do with the Duchy.\nDuring World War II, American troops stormed across this river in the epic fight that would become the Battle of the Bulge. A monument to their bravery stills stands outside of town today. A few kilometers from that monument rises the Abbey of Echternach, a massive concrete sanctuary constructed by the English monk St. Willibrord in 698 AD, thereby making Echternach the oldest city in one of the world’s smallest countries.\nIn perfectly quirky Luxembourgish fashion, for the last 500 years the Echternach dancing procession has taken place each Tuesday after Whit Sunday in the large square fronting the Abbey, though no one knows exactly why they are dancing. A curious celebration that features pairs of strangely clad Luxembourgish civilians hopping and clapping their way down the cobbled streets, the dance is officially recognized on the “UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity“.\nWhen not filled with poofy-shirted dancers, an alarming amount of bars and outdoor cafes spring from the town’s two main streets, though this should come as little surprise seeing as the Luxembourgish population potentially consumes more alcohol per capita than any country on the planet. Wedged between the vineyards of France, the Traapist beers of Belgium, and the Oktoberfest mindset of Germany, there really is little room to blame them.\nMore than a city of dancing and drinking (though really, what else is there?), Echternhach is also regarded as being one of the best places in Luxembourg to embark on the Mullerthal Trail. Tracing the wooded hills for 110km through Luxembourg’s Mullerthal region, the trail passes a number of natural sights that are potentially more fun to say out loud than they are to look at. Places with names like Schnellert (a forest), Schiessentumpel (a waterfall), and Wolfsschlucht (a dramatic stone canyon known as the “Wolves’ Den”), spring up along the trail, all of them part of the remarkably scenic and comprehensive network of trails that criss-cross the forests of the Grand Duchy.\nBack at my corner table, a curious clamor in the distance draws my attention away from perusing a pocket map of the Duchy. Cheerily in the midst of draining my second Belgian import, a rogue troop of nearly 30 local children are now marching down the main street beating a variety of drumsticks together in a mal-rhythmic terror. There are no words to accompany their impromptu march, just the clashing of wood on wood and little footsteps moving out of synch across the cobblestone. The blonde waitress shoots me a glance that she has no idea what’s going on either. It seems no one knows, yet oddly, no one seems to care. This is just another morning in Echternach, medieval Luxembourgish city of incessant curiosities.\nLuxembourg is a tiny, interesting place. It probably isn’t a destination in itself for most people, but it can be a great side trip from Paris, parts of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. If you can tack a few days onto your next vacation to that part of Europe, Luxembourg is a fun spot that you’d probably never visit otherwise.\nSince your time in Luxembourg is likely to be short – and dependent upon other factors in your vacation – it can help to have a few ideas in mind before you hit the ground. You want to make the most of your experience, of course, while minimizing the aggravation that can come with going from Point A to Point B. Below, you’ll find five tips for making your Luxembourg visit easier and more enjoyable.\n%Gallery-129220%1. Dip into the valley: up on the hill, Luxembourg is a city. It’s reasonably large and more interesting (as a city) than the likes of Amsterdam and Brussels, but it’s still a run-of-the-mill city. Step onto one of the walking paths, though, and you’ll descend into the Old Europe you’d expect from this microstate. Wander the winding streets, and enjoy the architecture that reminds you what the meaning of “classic” is. Interestingly, you’ll get a shock to the system when you see old and new side by side. There’s an interesting mix of contemporary and traditional architecture in Luxembourg, which gives the towns below a more organic vibe.\n2. Drink the local wine: it’s old hat for most travelers to sample the local stuff when visiting a new place. Trying new food and drinks is part of the fun! The food in Luxembourg won’t strike you as particularly exotic (though you can find a good meal there), but the wine is a different story. Crisp, flavorful and a pure pleasure to drink, you’ll find the perfect afternoon kicking back bottle after bottle while sitting outside and watching the people pass by.\n3. Don’t bother paying for the bus: in the mood for some international crime? The buses in Luxembourg provide the perfect opportunity. You have to pay to take them, but the bus drivers don’t check to see if you have a ticket. They don’t care. So, you can step onto the bus and go where you want without paying a dime. You are running a risk, however. The fines are steep if you get caught by the authorities tasked with spot-checking for tickets.\nOf course, I’m not advocating such illicit behavior. Buy a damned ticket – they’re cheap.\n4. Stay for the right amount of time: you don’t want to breeze through Luxembourg in an afternoon … but staying for a week probably doesn’t make sense. Give yourself two or three days, depending on how much time you want to invest in #2, above.\n5. Spring for a hotel downtown: to save a few bucks, I stayed out in the business district. It was a lot cheaper, and bus access to the city was fast, easy and reliable. But, it’s still a lot more enjoyable to roll out of bed and head right into the action.\nCreative new use for border crossing posts at German/Austrian border.\nIn the late 1980s, an American spending a summer traveling across Europe with a Eurailpass would see his or her passport stamped possibly dozens of times. With a few exceptions, every time a border was crossed, an immigration agent would pop his or her head into a train compartment, look at everyone’s passports, in most cases stamp them, and move on. Every Eastern Bloc country required visas, some of which could be obtained at the border and others of which had to be applied for in advance.\nToday, an American can enter the Schengen zone in Helsinki, fly to Oslo and then on to Amsterdam, proceed by train through Belgium, France, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, then by bus to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and then by ferry back to Helsinki before catching a flight to Athens and landing in Greece without once needing to submit a passport to a border guard’s scrutiny.\nThe development of the Schengen agreement across Europe has altered the geopolitical map of the continent in many ways. For tourists, the development of the Schengen zone has simplified travel by drastically reducing the number of times a passport can be checked and stamped as national borders are crossed.\nThe Schengen Agreement is named after the town of Schengen in Luxembourg. It was here in 1985 that five countries-Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, and France-signed an agreement to essentially create borderless travel between them. A model for this agreement had been created years before by the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), which eliminated border controls back in 1948. The Nordic countries also did away with internal border posts, in 1958.\nIn 1995, the five original Schengen countries plus Portugal and Spain inaugurated the zone. In 1997, Austria and Italy joined. Greece followed in 2000 and the five Nordic countries joined in 2001. In late 2007, nine more countries joined the Schengen zone; most recently, Switzerland signed up in 2008.\nAbandoned border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary.\nToday, 22 European countries are part of Schengen. Every European Union country (save the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus) belongs. Other members include EU holdouts Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. The European microstates present a few complications. Monaco’s borders are administered by France, which makes the tiny principality a part of Schengen, while Liechtenstein’s accession, approved by the European Parliament in February, is pending. San Marino and the Vatican are de facto versus official members, while mountainous, landlocked Andorra remains outside of the zone altogether.\nThere are five EU countries not currently part of the Schengen zone. The UK and Ireland (as well as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) operate a Schengen-like agreement called the Common Travel Area. Neither country is obligated to join the zone.\nRomania, Bulgaria, and Cyprus, however, are all bound by treaty to eventually join. Romania has fulfilled all the criteria for joining Schengen and Bulgaria is close to fulfillment as well. These two countries will accede together, likely later this year. Cyprus presents a more complicated situation given the division of the island between the Republic of Cyprus in the south and the largely unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north.\nWith the coming accession of the Western Balkans to the European Union, the Schengen zone will almost definitely continue to grow. Might it one day cover the entire landmass of Europe? Check back in two decades.\nEurope has lots of tiny countries. The rest of the world reminds itself of this fact periodically, almost as a running joke. How Vatican City is the smallest “independent” state, but (come on people), is it really a country? Andorra sounds charming, too, until you go there and discover it’s only the European Union’s largest outlet mall. Likewise, Monaco‘s just a casino with a racecar track, and Liechtenstein‘s a drive-thru bank for dodgy Russians with Austrian passports.\nDespite the less-romantic realities of present-day Europe, we travelers still get a kick out of these nifty, little hold-out principalities and monarchies. Somehow, they’ve prevailed in the tempest of European history, avoiding absorption into their larger neighbors all the way into the 21st century when we can ironically celebrate quirky existential nationhoods in the face of supranationalist sentiments.\nI first visited Luxembourg on a whim–hopped a train in Brussels and three hours later, stepped off somewhere deep in the Ardennes. I was young, brave, and poor and it was late at night. I walked away from the one-room station in Arlon and disappeared into the forest, bumbling in the woods until the sounds of passing cars disappeared. When I found a comfortable spot, I pushed away the pine needles and lay down on the cold ground, using my lumpy canvas backpack as a pillow.I woke up well past midnight to the softest sound–approaching footsteps? A gentle, rhythm-less pit-pat all around me. It took me several minutes to figure out that all I was hearing were leaves–dead autumn leaves falling from ancient trees and hitting the ground, one by one. That is the silence of Luxembourg–you can hear each leaf hitting the ground.\nA louder rustling woke me a few hours later–a little louder, a little closer, and a little more disconcerting. Panic, then peace set in: it was only a doe in the forest, rummaging, peeling bark from the pine trees and stepping timidly closer and closer to my little clouds of breath rising from the ground.\nI shivered in the forest until dawn, then hiked back to a road where I fell asleep at a bus stop like a grungy homeless person. I woke up bleary-eyed and asked one of the more respectable citizens nearby if this was Luxembourg. It was.\nThis was long after the EU but also long before Google Maps. Nowadays you can just google Luxembourg and see how a thin grey line–an international border–simply traces the length of a road, jumps a stream and cuts corners through some farmer’s field (“Well, nine-tenths of my wheat’s right here in Luxembourg but the other tenth is over in Belgium”).\nSomehow in the night I had entered this new country and now I was determined to explore it to the fullest extent. Using my finger and a map, I determined that Luxembourg’s fullest extent was around 30 miles–the length of road between Belgium and Germany. Thirty miles is nothing, really. I could walk that in a day, I thought. And so I did. I started that morning and ended at sunset when a bridge crossed the Moselle and I came to a polite, little square sign (chest-high) that barely announced “Deutschland”.\nTo figure out my to total walking distance across Luxembourg, I retraced my steps online. After punching in my start and end points, Google Maps shouts a stern warning in a yellow box: “Use Caution–This route may be missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths.” Indeed. My jaunty one-day trek across one of the smallest countries in the world was performed without the assistance of sidewalks or pedestrian paths (or a compass or a map). Most of the time I spent walking in open fields, loving the quaint freedom of fenceless Europe.\nOnly half a million people live in this country–an odd mix of imported Eurocrats, happy farmers, tax refugees, rich people with titles, and polyglot investment bankers. Maybe it’s not the twee world we had hoped for (black-booted princes on horseback or whistling peasants sticking pitchforks into haystacks), but even in the midst of today’s bland supermarché EU Europe, Luxembourg retains its heirloom personality in its customs, unique government, thousand-year old culture and its even odder language.\nIn the city of Luxembourg, I attended a Catholic mass read in Luxembourgish (aka Lëtzebuergesch, Luxembourgeois, Luxemburgisch) and found myself delighted by the strange mashup of French and German pronounced like guttural Dutch. Geez, I thought, it’s a whole different language spoken by fewer people than live in the Tallahassee metropolitan area.\nLuxembourg’s national motto is Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn or “We want to remain what we are.” The meaning is clear and pretty much sums up every country’s deepest patriotic longing. Because Luxembourg, too, is the red, white, and blue. Well, the red, white and light blue (turquoise?). This is a Grand Duchy folks–the only sovereign duchy left in the world–and the average American traveler to Europe overlooks it like they overlook high-fructose corn syrup. In the rush from Paris to Amsterdam to Munich and back, Luxembourg is the no-name brand of Europe that fails to inspire the uninitiated vacationer.\nIt’s a terrible mistake though, because honestly, nowhere is Europe more alive than in little Luxembourg. There is no Eiffel Tower or Oktoberfest or legalized",

Where quiet and pastoral comforts are much valued, where Sunday strolls pass over stone bridges and alongside flowered hedgerows, where no matter where you’ll look, you’ll find a tiny castle poking above the treeline in the distance. It’s nice.\nIn a time of megacities and mega-construction, we should be glad for a country like Luxembourg. Downtown Shanghai is larger than Luxembourg–Los Angeles County is four times as large. A lot of places are bigger than Luxembourg . . . and yet Luxembourg is the perfect size for travelers: big enough to be an actual country but still small enough to walk across in a day.

        "prompt": "This is your media plan. This is your media plan fighting drugs.\nEfforts by government and private authorities to combat teen drug-use stretch beyond that landmark 1980s campaign (created by ad industry executives), but few have been as effective as the one spearheaded last year by Foote Cone & Belding for the federal National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The media plan charted a new course in the third year of a five-year effort to reduce teenage marijuana use by 25 percent. Foote Cone surpassed annual awareness goals in a matter of months as it established a new strategy for talking to teens.\nThe use of television was radically rethought. Instead of aiming at parents and teens together, this plan zeroed in on teen lifestyles. “We eliminated big event programming like the Super Bowl and focused on their equivalent in the teen world, like the MTV Video Music Awards,” explains Rich Gagnon, president/worldwide media director. Out went anything that smacked of authority, such as Channel One; in came cherry-picked teen faves in broadcast (such as Fox’s American Idol, WB’s Smallville and UPN’s Veronica Mars) and cable (MTV, Fuse, The N, Cartoon Network and Comedy Central).\nNaturally, the plan was Web-heavy, using in-banner video, specific high-traffic teen sites such as Yahoo Launch and more. The online budget was doubled.\n“Teens are probably the most engaged audience on the Internet,” says associate media director Lisa DiBenedetto. “We want to reach them when they’re actively working with the Net, so we got very involved with page games, pre-rolls, custom quizzes and AOL Instant Messenger buddy icons. We were able to run video in the small space above the AIM buddy list.” Users were encouraged to download the up arrow that graphically represented Above the Influence—over 10,000 downloaded it in the first month. “For teens to use it for their buddy expression, and to use these images in their own blogs and Web sites, shows how much we embedded this in teens’ minds,” she says.\nThe agency partnered with Shockwave to create an online game, Zombie Escape, which engaged teens in fighting the zombifying effects of dope; housed at Shockwave and the campaign’s Web site, it drew more than 1 million game-plays. “That’s a lot of people deciding they want to engage in the philosophy of Above the Influence,” says Ellet.\nGaming was part of a sizable out-of-home daypart to reach teens in malls, arcades, movie theatres and EB Games stores. Another outdoor strategy used to energize the campaign’s relaunch involved specially created wall murals in 25 top markets. “They were the artists’ own interpretations of what Above the Influence meant, placed adjacent to skateboard parks, schools and other potential high-risk zones,” says Ganon, noting that locations were extensively scouted. Likewise, customized murals were created for the campaign’s on-site sponsorship of the teen-centric X Games, in an effort that dovetailed with TV, print and online components for the event.\nThe print schedule required separate approaches. It’s a little easier to reach girls, with core teen female titles including Teen People and Elle Girl for mass, plus specialty title American Cheerleader. Boys require a patchwork of targeted titles ranging from comic books (both Marvel and DC—the teen-oriented titles); gaming titles like Electronic Gaming Monthly; sports books like ESPN The Magazine and Sports Illustrated (the latter offers a copy-split under-21 edition), and extreme sporting titles from TransWorld such as Skateboarding and Snowboarding. “We bought 15 titles to reach teen boys, but you don’t need that many to reach teen girls,” says Ellet, adding that the agency ordered consecutive pages at launch for added oomph.\nAnother wrinkle is the long-standing requirement on government jobs to secure a one-for-one match from media vendors. That one-for-one deal is off the negotiated",
        "baseline": " rate, adds Ellet, not an inflated rate card. “We really engaged the media community to make it part of this process,” he says.\nHe also cites a well-segmented plan that offered separate messages to teens and parents with very little “spill.” As for results, teen awareness of Above the Influence ads reached nearly 60 percent in two months, with 3.7 million clicks to the Web site—double the previous amount. More important, marijuana use among teens has dropped 19 percent since the campaign’s inception.\n“It was a big change moving toward online and to more edgy programs, but that’s where the teen eyeballs are,” the client concludes. “Foote Cone designed a plan that’s substantially different from what we had before, but we know it was effective in getting to teens.”\tEric Schmuckler is a contributing writer to Mediaweek.",

        "prompt": "If you plan on traveling this holiday season, check out these three credit cards first.\nThere has never been a better time to get a credit card than right now. Competition in the credit card industry is fierce right now, and when businesses have to compete aggressively, consumers win. Specifically, there are credit card introductory offers and reward rates that would have been unheard of just a few years ago. Here are three excellent choices if you're planning on doing some traveling this holiday season.\nMy favorite credit card for general travel is the Capital One Venture card, and in full disclosure, this is my go-to everyday credit card in my own wallet. The card offers an industry-leading reward rate of two miles per dollar on all purchases and offers a 40,000-mile bonus after $3,000 in spending. And Capital One's travel redemption process is quite painless. You can use your miles to make purchases on any travel website or app you choose and simply receive a statement credit toward the cost.\nTo be fair, the Venture card doesn't have any of the travel perks that some other cards on this list do, such as free checked bags, lounge access, or reimbursement for incidental expenses. However, it also has the lowest annual fee -- just $59, which is waived for the first year.\nIf you don't mind doing your traveling on a specific airline, the Delta Air Lines co-branded American Express cards are worth a look. Despite having some excellent benefits, the main reason I suggest these specific cards is that they come in three distinct levels, making them appropriate for everyone from the occasional traveler to the million-mile-per-year business flyer.\nThe next level is the Platinum version of the card, which charges a higher $195 annual fee (not waived the first year) but adds a companion certificate each year, which is essentially a buy-one-get-one-free coupon for a coach-class domestic ticket. In addition, the Platinum gives you the ability to earn Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) for high spending, which can help you achieve elite status with the airline. The current Platinum card offer is 70,000 miles, 10,000 MQMs, and a $100 statement credit after $3,000 in spend in the first three months, and the standard offer is 35,000 miles and 5,000 MQMs.\nFinally, the Reserve card has a significantly higher $450 annual fee but adds two valuable perks. The first is Delta Sky Club access, which is worth $50 every time you use it and can be extremely valuable for frequent flyers. The second is the ability to redeem the annual companion certificate for a first-class flight, not just coach. This benefit alone can be worth the annual fee. Granted, the introductory bonus of 10,000 miles and 10,000 MQMs isn't the best, but keep in mind that this card is designed for frequent travelers who will earn plenty of rewards over time.\nA relatively new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, has taken the concept of a high-end travel credit card to another level. For starters, the card is currently offering an industry-leading introductory bonus of 100,000 points after $4,000 in spending during the first three months, as well as a 50% bonus when redeeming points for travel. In other words, the introductory bonus alone is worth $1,500 in travel.\nIn addition, you'll get a $300 annual travel credit, airport lounge access, and a $100 credit for the cost of TSA Pre-Check or Global Entry.",
        "baseline": " The card earns points at the rate of three points per dollar of travel expenses and dining, which is effectively a 4.5% rate if you plan on using rewards for travel, and one point per dollar on other purchases.\nThe card does have a rather hefty $450 annual fee, but if you use your card often or travel frequently, you may find it well worth the cost.\nOK, so technically this list featured five credit cards, not three, but there are indeed three distinct categories of people who will benefit from these. If you aren't necessarily a big spender or frequent traveler who wants to maximize your reward potential, the Capital One Venture Rewards Card could be best for you. If you don't mind being locked in to one airline, one of the Delta Amex cards could make your traveling smoother and more rewarding. And if you're a heavy spender or frequent traveler, the Chase Sapphire Reserve can give you some great travel benefits while allowing you to choose your favorite airline.",
        "llm_baseline": "The card also offers a 3x bonus rate on travel and dining,and a 3x bonus rate on everything in between.The only downside to the card is the$10 annual fee,which is n't worth it for the first year.However,if you ' re a frequent traveler,the benefits of the card will more than make up for the fee.The bottom line is,if you ' re planning on doing some traveling this holiday season,these three travel cards are a great place to start.##10 Things You Should Know About the iPhone 7:11 a.m. 2018##10 Things You Should Know About the iPhone 7#10 Things You Should Know About the iPhone 7 The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are here,and they're better than ever.The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are here,and they ' re better than ever.The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are here,and they ' re better than ever.The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are here,and they ' re better than ever.",

Roll out the pâte brisée and line the pan with it, trimming the excess with a roll of the pin. Let rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.\nHalve and pit the plums. If your plums are very small (1 inch/2.5 cm), just leave them as halves; otherwise cut them into quarters or sixths. Arrange the plums skin side down on the dough in a circular pattern, starting from the outside, overlapping slightly; the plums will shrink slightly as they bake. Alternate plum colours if using a mix. Bake for 20 minutes.\nWhile the tart is baking, in a small saucepan, heat the apricot jam over low heat. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove pieces of skin.\nRemove the tart from the oven (but leave the oven on). Remove the sides of the tart pan. Using a pastry brush and the strained apricot jam, glaze the sides of the tart, outside and in, and the top of the fruit. Return to the oven until darkly caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.\nI recommend a metal tart pan with a removable bottom: Metal conducts heat best, and you can expose the sides of the tart in the final baking phase for optimal, Petits Mitrons–like caramelization. If you don’t have one, the next best thing is a metal tart pan without a removable bottom.\nI like to use a mix of two or three varieties of plums if available. You can use frozen plums straight from the freezer, without thawing.\nIn a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter. Process for 10 seconds, until you get a breadcrumb–like consistency. Add the egg and process for a few more seconds, until the dough comes together into a ball.",

If the dough seems a little dry, mix in a little ice-cold water, 1 or 2 teaspoons at a time, until the dough comes together.\nTip the dough onto a clean work surface and knead lightly for a few seconds.

But the sensation it created on Twitter and other social media outlets is understandable nonetheless, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke.\n\"When you have something like this occur at 8 o'clock at night over one of the most populated regions of the United States, it's going to get people's attention,\" Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., told reporters today (March 23).\nThe Manhattan meteor entered our planet's atmosphere over eastern Pennsylvania Friday and streaked southeast from there, flaming out over the Atlantic Ocean. While space rocks of this size sometimes produce meteorites (rocks that survive to reach Earth's surface), Cooke said, it's unlikely that scientists or collectors will snag any pieces of this one.\n\"The eyewitness accounts indicate that this meteor was last seen about 70 kilometers [43 miles] into the Atlantic, so I do not believe there are any meteorites on land from this event,\" Cooke said.\nSome eyewitnesses have posted videos of the meteor to YouTube, which Cooke and his",
        "baseline": " colleagues have been poring over. NASA runs a network of fireball cameras, but the instruments were apparently all clouded out or too far away to observe the event, Cooke said.\nFriday's meteor follows closely on the heels of several other dramatic space rock events. For example, a huge fireball detonated without warning over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15, wounding more than 1,200 people. Just hours later, a 130-foot-wide (40 m) asteroid called 2012 DA14 gave Earth an uncomfortably close shave, coming nearer than our planet's ring of geosynchronous satellites.\nBut people shouldn't start worrying that the sky is falling, Cooke stressed.\n\"If you look at the actual number of fireballs for this month so far, it's normal — it's the same as every other year before this one,\" he said. \"It's just that people are paying more attention and looking up, I think, because of recent events.\"",

And we know that early school start times are one major contributor for the inadequate sleep that we see in teenagers.\"\nWithout enough sleep, Beebe says teens can be more moody, tend to eat more unhealthy food, and are more sedentary",

        "prompt": "You have to give the entrepreneurs in the world of cryptocurrencies credit.\nAfter the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble and increased regulatory push back, they’ve developed a new way to raise millions from investors and enthusiasts still dreaming of digital gold.\nWhile Initial Coin Offerings have been pretty much declared dead, startups are now raising money through a similar method dubbed Initial Exchange Offerings.\nInstead of marketing coins directly to investors, companies are relying on crypto exchanges to serve as underwriters, review the projects and offer tokens to vetted customers. Think of it as a curated ICO - the way wardrobes are stylised and shipped directly by services such as Stitch Fix.\nBetting that the vetted IEOs reduce the chances of getting scammed, retail investors have been pouring in after many got burned in the ICO frenzy that saw many tokens lose more than 90 per cent of their value. About $180 million has been raised in 23 offerings, with most taking place since February, according to crypto data tracker CoinSchedule.com.\n\"It has the potential to be larger than the ICOs of 2017,\" said Bill Shihara, chief executive of Seattle-based exchange Bittrex, which recently held its first IEO. \"We are seeing significant demand both from our users and token teams.\"\nICO sales peaked at $5.8 billion in June and have dropped steeply since in the wake of a US regulatory crackdown and market collapse. In March, they took in just $208.6m, according to CoinSchedule.com.\nAs with the ICO boom, the latest funding mechanism is still exposing investors to the risk of fraud. The vetting process varies across exchanges. And it’s not clear that regulators will look at the IEOs any more fondly than they do on ICOs.\nIEOs \"take everything from an ICO and make it worse,\" said Zach Fallon, a securities lawyer who worked on ICO issues at the US Securities and Exchange Commission until about a year ago.\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Malta-based Binance, pioneered the IEO idea in 2017, but only put its muscle behind it earlier this year, with the popular software file sharing application BitTorrent raising $7m in under 15 minutes. Smaller exchange Exmarkets is already leading in the number of offerings, according to CoinSchedule.com. The exchanges charge as much as 10 per cent of the total sale amount, Mr Shihara said.\nMany exchange-specific tokens such as Binance Coin have been on a tear recently thanks to the high investor expectations for IEOs, according to Jeff Dorman, a partner and portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Arca Funds. Tokens issued by exchanges themselves are up 200 per cent on average, he said in a recent note.\n“The irony of course is that this is directly at odds with the decentralised ethos embedded in crypto, but this has been conveniently ignored as long as it’s working,” Mr Dorman said. “Everyone involved is highly motivated not to kill the golden goose.\"\nSome exchanges are also profiting by making IEO issuers raise funds via their own token, or requiring traders that want to grab IEO tokens to hold large balances of the specific exchange’s coins to participate in the sales.\nThe forced use of the exchange coins make IEO tokens even more suspect for regulators, Mr Fallon said. Because tokens created in an IEO are immediately listed on an exchange and sold in a secondary market, it makes it more likely that the SEC would view them as securities, he said. The exchange listing these tokens appear to be acting as broker-dealers, too, he said. That’s probably why most IEOs so far have only targeted non-US investors, and have been facilitated by exchanges based in places like Malta, where regulation is less stringent.\n\"We need to walk before we can run,\" said Nejc Kofric, CEO of Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, which is staying away from IEOs. “The industry needs to be better regulated before we step into this market. Of course there are exchanges that still enter this space, and I think that’s short-sighted.\"\nTransparency remains an issue in the crypto world, with Bitwise Asset Management pointing out last month that",

The digital-transaction platform hasn’t issued a token, and doesn’t have any ongoing token sale, Algorand wrote in a Twitter post this week.\nJust like with ICOs, many start-ups issuing tokens through IEOs don’t yet have a product. Take Pledgecamp, which had in February conducted three IEOs - in Korea, Japan and China - in addition to an ICO, according to Eddie Lee, president of Pledgecamp. The crowdfunding start-up is still building its platform, which is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.\n\"Having a trusted intermediary is a good thing for either an ICO of a coin or an IPO of common stock, all else equal,\" said Aaron Brown, an investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion.",

He’s been all but invisible since he retired three decade ago, but there’s been something of a Bill Withers renaissance following his recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and it continued in New York last night when he returned to Carnegie Hall to watch a superstar ensemble recreate his historic 1972 concert to benefit the Stuttering Association for the Young in an event organized by City Winery CEO Michael Dorf.\nAn absolutely stunning band was assembled for the show, including drummer Steve Jordan, bassist Willie Weeks, guitarist Felicia Collins, keyboardist–musical director Greg Phillinganes and backup singers Cindy Mizelle, Jory Steinberg and Bill’s own daughter, Kori Withers. They were joined by the Antibalas horn section and a string ensemble that expertly reproduced the lush sound of the original records and kept the show moving like clockwork with virtually no dead time between performers.\nMerely playing the Live at Carnegie Hall album would have meant neglecting everything but Withers’ earliest work, so the show began and ended with a series of latter-day tunes. South African R&B singer Jonathan Butler got the night off to a rapturous start with 1977’s “Lovely Day,” and Michael McDonald kept everyone’s spirits high with “Hello Like Before.” Ledisi then showed off her impressive vocal chops on “Who Is He (and What Is He to You),” and Valerie Simpson teamed up with Gregory Porter for “Let Me Be the One You Need” — the pair truly made the song their own.\nD’Angelo was supposed to kick off the album portion of the evening with “Use Me,” but he fell ill at the last moment. Dr. John proved a more-than-capable replacement, and he infused the tune with his trademark New Orleans grooves. Ed Sheeran had the young people in the audience squealing with delight (and flagrantly breaking Carnegie Hall’s “no cell-phone” policy) when he came out for “Ain’t No Sunshine.” He began the tune on the acoustic guitar, before the band kicked it and brought it to a soaring climax.\nAmos Lee spoke about how Bill’s music changed his life before delivering an emotionally charged “Grandma’s Hands” that brought Carnegie Hall to a hushed silence. Keb’ Mo’ recalled his relief at not getting drafted into the Vietnam War before playing the stirring anti-war tune “I Can’t Write Left-Handed.” Organizers might have been tempted to save “Lean on Me” for the very end, but",

Steve Inskeep talks to Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, about the U.S. and China reaching a temporary truce in the ongoing trade war launched earlier this year.\nThere's A Truce In The U.S.-China Trade War. What's Been Achieved?\nSteve Inskeep talks to Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, about the U.S. and China reaching a temporary truce in the ongoing trade war launched earlier this year.\nPresident Trump backed away from his latest threat against China. After dinner with China's leader, the president says he will not increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Ten percent tariffs that he imposed will stay. An increase to 25 percent will not take effect for now. In exchange, China says it will buy a lot of American goods.\nErin Ennis will discuss this with us. She is senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an organization of companies that do business with China. She's in the studios.\nINSKEEP: What do you make of this announcement?\nENNIS: Well, it certainly is progress, considering what the alternative was. We all had been anticipating that that 25 percent increase on January 1 would be put into place, so halting it for 90 days is a good start. But 90 days isn't that long, and so we certainly are going to be looking for what kind of progress might be made in that period. And hopefully, that means that we would then see a pathway to reduce the tariffs that remain in place as well.\nINSKEEP: We also haven't been told exactly what China is supposed to buy in exchange for the president backing off. Do you have any idea?\nENNIS: We have not seen any specifics. I guess I would just note that the tariffs themselves, actually, weren't tied to any concerns about how much China buys from the United States. The tariffs are tied to concerns about intellectual property rights protection and technology transfer policies. And so until those issues get addressed, it's difficult to see what the pathway is to reducing the tariffs. And of course, China also has retaliatory tariffs on many of the products that it's about to buy. We don't know if China is reducing those tariffs as well.\nINSKEEP: Well, that's an interesting point. You are observing that the fundamental problem the United States has with China is the way China does business, things like intellectual property rights and technology transfers that are forced and that sort of thing. There's no agreement to deal with any of that yet.\nENNIS: There's an agreement to talk about those issues. And that, again, is progress. And it's something that the business community has been calling for since the beginning of these discussions. There's no disagreement that China is a very challenging place to do business. In addition to intellectual property rights issues and technology transfer concerns, there's market access restrictions that are at the core of how many companies can even enter the market to begin doing business there. So those things are the issues that the business community has been in agreement, need to be addressed. We've had concerns about the use of tariffs to try to get progress on those issues. But having both countries sit down at the table and talk about those substantive issues and make progress on them, that's what we've all been looking for.\nINSKEEP: OK. So it's good that they're going to talk some more. In the meantime, China basically offers a payoff. We don't exactly know what the payoff is. China says, we're going to buy something. And in return, China continues to get not quite such restricted access to U.S. markets.\nI want to ask about the broader approach here. You say you agree with the president, there's a problem here. People in the business community agree there's a problem with China. The way the president has approached trade issues - he did this with NAFTA; now he's done it with China - he makes a big threat. I'm going to destroy NAFTA. But then he ends up adjusting NAFTA or getting a new NAFTA that's got a lot of the same features. Now, here, he makes a big threat on tariffs, ends up backing off at least for now. Is this good for business?\nENNIS: Well, much like nature abhors a vacuum, business abhors uncertainty. So no, we",
        "baseline": " don't feel this is actually the right way to be doing these kinds of things. I will note, the president has not backed off of tariffs. What he's backed off of is an increase in tariffs.\nINSKEEP: There's still a 10 percent tariff.\nENNIS: We've got tariffs on about $267 billion worth of goods already between the tariffs related to steel and aluminum and to these issues on technology transfer and IP. So the president has not reduced tariffs in any way. There is still uncertainty. Ninety days is a - you know, three months - really short time to address issues that have been longstanding in the relationship. So I would say, we don't know yet whether the president has a plan that will reduce those tariffs and what that will mean.\nINSKEEP: Ms. Ennis, thanks for coming by. Really appreciate it.\nINSKEEP: Erin Ennis is senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council.",

        "prompt": "On May 11 a Honduran migrant, Marco Antonio Munoz, was taken into custody near the Texas border and separated from his wife and 3-year-old son. He was 39 years old and seeking asylum for his family. Agents \"had to use physical force to take the child out of his hands.\" That's when he \"snapped\" and ended up in isolation at the Starr County sheriff's office. After two days in isolation he killed himself. His wife and son were later released from Border Patrol custody, destination not given.\nHe was detained as a result of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' \"zero tolerance\" policy on illegal border crossings.\nCharacteristically, Donald Trump is blaming the Democrats for the separation of families, reportedly 1,800 of them between October 2016 and February of this year. Trump is lying about the Democrats' role in this practice. He and truth seem to be strangers.\nMy query to your readers is what would you do if someone was trying to take your child from you simply because you were trying to find a better life for your family in \"the land of opportunity?\"\nI don't know what the answer is to the illegal border-crossing problem. I know it's not a wall for which taxpayers would have to foot the bill and the effectiveness of which is questionable. I do know that separating families is not a viable solution or who we are. \"Give me your tired, your poor,\" indeed.\nIt seems that some in the Legislature are demanding that \"Senator A\" resign because he is causing harm to the reputation of the rest of the legislators. He hasn't been indicted or charged but the rest of the club wants to get ahead of any damage. I think it is a little late to start worrying about their public perceptions.\nIn recent years, several legislators have either pleaded guilty or been convicted on charges involving voter tampering, misuse of funds, bribery and fraud. And let's don't forget the continuing misuse of the General Improvement Fund process.\nThey doubled the legislative sessions--now meeting every year instead of every other. And they have committees that meet almost continually, meaning that we are paying per diem to many of them all year long. Oh, we also found out that some legislators were traveling to Little Rock and collecting daily to sit in on committee meetings when they were not even members of the committee.\nThere is also the constitutional amendment a few years back that was intentionally written to mislead the voters regarding term limits. The ballot title referred to establishing term limits as if we didn't already have limits. Buried deep inside the text of the amendment was wording that extended limits, giving the politicians more time on the gravy train.\nFor this year's election, the oh-so-ethical legislators added a tort reform issue to the ballot. But in their usual methods of underhandedness, they've tacked on a provision that would give them control of many of the state's court processes. A slimy power grab hidden in what they perceive as an issue that might pass even though the court takeover would not if it had to stand on its own.\nThe Arkansas Legislature has engaged in deceit, deception and dishonesty on a grand scale. Perhaps before they spend a lot of time calling out one member, they might engage in a group gaze into a mirror and discuss what they see.\nThe U.S. and China both manufacture automobiles which are shipped back and forth between them. If the U.S. puts a 30 percent tariff on automobiles produced in China and sold in the U.S, the price of these imported autos can be expected to rise by 30 percent. Since the ability of the Chinese manufacturers to compete on price is thus reduced, the price or profit on sales of autos produced and sold in the U.S. can be expected to increase, up to 30 percent.\nNo wonder Wall Street is doing so well.\nI received notice that the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette would not be delivered in my area after the end of June.\nPersonally, I could not care less. I was about to cancel the paper anyway. Little things about the paper have upset me, publishing Wumo instead of Mallard Fillmore, for one, and allowing John Brummett to continue to lambaste our president.\nBrummett is a bully, attacking POTUS at every opportunity. It seems the president has defused a very hostile situation in Korea but we will never hear a positive comment from Brummett. Trump is not a clown. When you look at the positive things he has accomplished, you have to admire him in doing exactly what he said he would do. That's why he was elected president.\nBrummett should leave the country if he is so unhappy with our president. I am sure he would be happy in Venezuela, Cuba, or some socialist country he admires.\nI read the entire John Brummett online column Wednesday. Usually I read one sentence and take a deep breath and move on. Wednesday his column about Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered a bit of a window into his persona.\nKudos to John Brummett! In his June 5 column he writes, \"Sixty-three million Americans, give or take, voted for Trump",
        "baseline": " for president. It seems entirely plausible to me that some of those 63 million were not racists nor haters nor resentful primitives.\"\nHow charitable can he be to us knuckle-dragging conservatives that don't ascribe to Brummett's elite and arrogant scribes. Why, if he continues with this thinking, he might even astonish us with an estimate of maybe 200 or 300 out of the 63 million are decent individuals.\nTwo words to describe Brummett's writings--disgusting and insulting.\nOne picture is good for a thousand lies.\nHas John Brummett delivered as many diatribes against Pol Pot, Mao Zedong, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Castro, Hugo Chavez, and Khrushchev, combined, as he has against President Trump?\nI'm sure Russia's Gorbachev, of course, would be exempt from Brummett's bile, while Reagan would be the main enemy of civilization, per Brummett.",

The famous Adagio was finely etched, sensual and romantic without heaviness. Karadaglić’s fleet, energetic reading of the finale captured the brightness of the off-kilter melodies.\nDiscreetly amplified to carry in the vast spaces of the Arsht Center’s Knight Concert Hall, Karadaglić’s Greg Smallman guitar was a fine instrument with particularly deep and distinct bass notes. His wonderfully virile rendition managed to clear away the clichés and mannerisms that afflict many performances of the Aranjuez.\nGiancarlo Guerrero, principal guest conductor for the orchestra’s Miami residency, is an expert accompanist. He deftly blended and balanced Rodrigo’s piquant wind and string writing without overpowering his soloist. Rhythms were crisp and snappy, the unison violins sounded lustrous and brash trumpet interjections in the finale perked up the ears. One can only wonder why Karadaglić’s fine performance was accorded only one curtain call by an audience that loudly cheered the flashier orchestral scores.\nLike Gustav Holst (composer of The Planets, which Guerrero led in Miami last season), Ottorino Respighi anticipated the modern motion picture soundtrack with his extravagant orchestral tone poems. The Fountains of Rome, the first and most artful of Respighi’s Roman trilogy, displayed the evening’s largest orchestral complement with two harps, celesta, expanded strings, brass and percussion and eight double basses filling the stage.\nGuerrero managed to bring out the poetry amid Respighi’s wide-screen panorama of orchestral colors. The soft string sounds and evocative wind tints with celesta exquisitely blended into the orchestral fabric evoked night turning to dawn in the opening portrait of the Villa Giulia fountain. Delicate pianissimos and fine blends of tolling bells, celesta and harps over whispered strings encapsulated the Technicolor sunset of the Villa Medici finale.",

Concertmaster William Preucil managed to top his colleagues, bringing agility and virtuosity to the numerous violin solos and cadenzas. Opening at a brisk pace, Guerrero rendered the Latin-tinged melodies and dance rhythms at full thrust.\nThe Cleveland Orchestra repeats the program 8 p.m. Saturday at the Arsht Center in Miami. 305-949-6722; arshtcenter.org.",

They slow things down.\nScientists estimate that over roughly four decades, 93 percent of global warming heat went into the ocean (the other 3 percent warmed the rocks and land, 3 percent melted glaciers, sea ice and other frozen water and 1 percent went into the atmosphere).\nSo where is all of that warmer water? Johnson and other researchers have some clues — and are hoping that a new project will tell them much more.\nNOAA and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen are launching cutting-edge, high-tech monitors in a project called Deep Argo that will explore conditions in the deepest stretches of the oceans, basins that can reach nearly 4 miles deep.\n“Deep Argo will revolutionize deep ocean observing,” said Johnson, the project lead and a scientist at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.\nIn a rare public-private partnership, the philanthropy is donating $4 million to the effort. The organization is also providing free use of the Petrel, Allen’s research vessel. It’s the same ship that recently discovered the wreck of the World War II ship the USS Indianapolis more than 3 miles below the surface of the Philippine Sea.\nOcean scientists have a robust monitoring system for the upper ocean, which spans the surface down to about 2,000 meters, or 1.2 miles. Through the international Argo program, more than 3,770 floats worldwide are continually taking measurements used to track temperature, salinity and other conditions.\nBut data from deep in the oceans have mostly been collected on cruises conducted about once in 10 years beginning in the 1990s. That provided snapshots of information that was useful, but difficult for recognizing trends. Deep Argo can help change that.\nThe project will use new glass floats designed to withstand the extreme pressure experienced under the weight of miles of water. It takes one of the floats about a day to sink to the bottom of the ocean. It returns to the surface for only 15-30 minutes to send data to scientists via a radio satellite phone. Its buoyancy is controlled by adding or removing oil from an external bladder.\nWe have a different risk tolerance. We were able to come in and fill in this important data gap.\nThe researchers are going to test five of the floats in coming months before ordering an additional 28 if they work out. The new devices are a bit of a gamble.\n“Traditional funders looked at this as risky,” said Spencer Reeder, director of climate and energy initiatives for Paul G. Allen Philanthropies.\nClimate change is a key concern for Paul Allen and the philanthropy, Reeder said. An essential component to that interest is supporting research that will help scientists and others better understand the causes and effects of climate change.\nIf all goes well in the testing phase, the researchers will be deploying floats in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of South America into the Brazil Basin beginning in 2019. There are other deep floats in a few spots around the world, but the new deployments will double the number.\nOnce data are collected and verified as valid, the information will be released online for anyone to analyze.\nThe oceans are not uniform and can have distinct layers of water of different temperatures, salinity and density. Researchers already know that the deep ocean water is warming in many places. Some scientists estimate that the volume of cold, salty water at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean has been shrinking by 10 percent a decade since the 1990s.\nHow much heat can the oceans continue to absorb before more will go into the atmosphere, and how will that affect warming trends?\n",
        "baseline": "How quickly is the deep ocean warming?\nHow might the warming and changes in salinity affect currents that circulate the world’s ocean water, which also affects land temperatures?\nHow much will the warming worsen sea level rise, given that warmer water is less dense and therefore takes up more space?\nThe grant and partnership are for a 3-year period, with the hope that the work can continue with other support.\n“It is absolutely acting as a catalyst to demonstrate a new technology,” Reeder said.\nThe philanthropy is working on a variety of climate-related issued, including ocean acidfication, forest preservation and public policy. The organization has also partnered with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the Smart City Challenge, which aims to improve transportation and reduce pollution associated with travel.\nThe Trump administration has proposed dramatic cuts to climate-related research, including a $1.4 billion cut to the Department of Commerce budget, which includes NOAA.",

        "prompt": "For the second time, GOP leaders have lost the support of a key House veteran for the American Health Care Act at a critical juncture.\nWhen the American Health Care Act died its first death in March, the House Republican who dealt the final, fatal blow to the bill was not a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus, nor was it a freshman worried about his or her chances of reelection.\nIt was Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a 22-year House veteran, scion of a New Jersey political dynasty, and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Though the committee’s influence has diminished amid the GOP’s spendthrift ways of the last decade, its chairman sits on a perch just below the party leadership in the informal hierarchy of the House.\nFrelinghuysen had been on few of the public whip counts listing who might vote against the health-care bill; his loyalty to Speaker Paul Ryan was assumed. But on the day the House was set to vote, Frelinghuysen blindsided his Republican colleagues by releasing a statement opposing the legislation on the grounds that it would impose “significant new costs and barriers to care” on his constituents in New Jersey. In the hours after his announcement, similar statements from fence-sitting Republicans flooded in, and Ryan pulled the bill from the floor.\nSix weeks later, GOP leaders are once again scrambling to pass their replacement for the Affordable Care Act, having secured the support of the Freedom Caucus with an amendment weakening the current law’s insurance mandates. Again they appear short of votes, and again they find themselves reeling from the surprising defection of a party stalwart. This time it was Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, a 30-year House vet who until January served as chairman of one of the two committees charged with writing Republican health policy. As head of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Upton was instrumental in the dozens of bills the House GOP passed to repeal or roll back Obamacare, along with its largely undeveloped plans to replace it. The only reason he isn’t still chairman of the panel—and as such, an architect of the AHCA—is that House Republicans bar their members from leading a single committee for more than three terms.\nOn Tuesday, Upton officially withdrew his support for the bill, telling a local radio station that he had informed the GOP leadership that he could not vote for it as long as it included the Freedom Caucus-backed provision allowing states to opt out of the requirement that insurers charge people with preexisting conditions the same premiums as everyone else. As with Frelinghuysen’s announcement, Upton’s reveal had the feel of a death knell for the latest Republican proposal. Under pressure from the White House, the leadership has been pushing for a vote by the end of the week, whipping lawmakers and trying to cobble together the 216 votes it needs to pass.\nWhat made Upton’s decision so damaging for Ryan is that he decided to make it public at all. Neither he nor Frelinghuysen is considered at risk of defeat in next year’s elections, so their vocal opposition is probably not necessary for their political survival. The public whip counts list around 19 or 20 Republicans formally opposed to the current bill, and the leadership can afford no more than 22 defections. (Frelinghuysen has not come out for or against this version.) Dozens of members remain undecided, or at least publicly undeclared; they might genuinely be torn, or perhaps they don’t want to vote for the bill and are hoping it doesn’t come up at all, but as a favor to GOP leaders they are keeping their position quiet. It’s common in close votes for reluctant members to tell their leaders that they’ll vote for a bill on the floor only if their support is absolutely needed for it to pass.\nUpton chose not to go that route. He made his opposition public, and then he went a step further by telling The Hill that adding more money to treat sicker people in high-risk pools would not be enough to win his support. His explanation hurts the leadership’s cause even more, because it directly contradicts the argument Ryan made only a couple hours earlier. Ryan said the GOP’s bill would strengthen protections for preexisting conditions rather than weaken them, because it would give states more flexibility in crafting insurance regulations. As Rich Lowry notes in the National Review, Upton risks charges of hypocrisy in citing his support for",
        "baseline": " preexisting conditions. He wrote and voted for numerous bills over the years that would have repealed Obamacare entirely, including all of its consumer protections. But when Republicans wrote legislation that actually has a chance of becoming law, he and other moderate members of the conference have scurried away.\nUpton was not the only surprising “no” vote to emerge this week. Representative Billy Long of Missouri, a close ally of President Trump who is neither a moderate nor a member of the Freedom Caucus, cited the same preexisting-condition provision in opposing the bill on Monday. And several Republican deputy whips who are responsible for persuading rank-and-file members to back leadership bills are themselves unwilling to commit to the legislation. But like Frelinghuysen before him, it is Upton whose defection resonates the loudest—a siren blasted by an elder statesmen toward the leadership, and a warning that their faltering health-care bill might be doomed yet again.",
        "llm_baseline": "cited the AHCA’s pre-emption clause as a reason to oppose the House Freedom Caucus’s bill.Upton’s decision to go public with his opposition to the bill is a sign of how much the AHCA has become a political liability to the GOP.The bill is unpopular with the House Freedom Caucus,and it’s unpopular with the party’s base.The Freedom Caucus’s support for the bill is conditional,because the Republicans who have been holding out for more money to help the people are not likely to be satisfied with the$2 billion Ryan has promised.The bill’s fate is now in the hands of the House Freedom Caucus,which has been demanding more concessions from the AHCA.The group’s chairman,Representative Jeff Meadows,has said he’s prepared to vote against the bill if the leadership adds more money to the high-risk pools,but",

According to scientists from the University of Helsinki, our universe may exhibit similar properties, a phenomenon they're dubbing Tardis spacetime. It’s a new theory that could solve a longstanding mystery in cosmology.\nTop image courtesy Rob Semenoff.\nScientists aren’t entirely sure why the universe is accelerating. To that end, they’ve posited a number of theories, including the presence of a mysterious dark energy that’s causing space to expand at an accelerating rate.\nBut according to Mikko Lavinto and colleagues, the universe isn’t actually expanding. It only looks that way from our perspective. Our view of the cosmos, they argue, is the product of an optical illusion created by regions of space that are bigger on the inside than they appear on the outside.\nInspired by Doctor Who’s TARDIS, they’ve dubbed this the Cosmological Tardis Model (also described as a “Swiss Cheese” model of the universe littered with “inhomogeneous holes”).\nTheir method is straightforward. These guys took a standard model of the expanding universe and then replaced certain regions of spacetime with other regions that had a bigger volume but the same surface area. “We have removed a portion of spacetime and ﬁtted in its place another region that ﬁts smoothly into the hole on the boundary, but has larger spatial volume than the removed part,” they say.\nThat’s possible because different regions of spacetime can have different curvatures. A two dimensional example would be to cut a disc out of a flat sheet and replace it with hemisphere. This hemisphere would have the same circumference as the disc but a greater surface area because it is curved. In other words, this region of space would be bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.\n",
        "baseline": "Lavinto and co then calculated what our Universe would look like if it contained Tardis regions. It turns out that as the universe expands, the volume of Tardis regions grows more quickly and this makes it look as if the expansion of the entire universe is accelerating.\nIn addition, Tardis regions should appear like parts of the universe that are particularly low density. And fascinatingly, our universe does indeed feature such regions, which are called voids. These are huge swaths of the cosmos that have far fewer celestial objects than other parts of the universe.\nThe solution is far from perfect, however, in that it doesn’t exactly mesh with our observations; when light enters a Tardis region, it should bend sharply owing to the greater curvature. But this isn’t what astronomers observe, so Lavinto and colleagues still have their work cut out for them in explaining why we (appear to) observe light that travels in the same direction.",

        "prompt": "FRUSTRATED Daryl Powell conceded his Castleford Tigers do not have the big-game mentality needed to win crucial games after their title hopes disappeared once more.\nBeaten Grand Finalists last term, the West Yorkshire club fell short again last night after losing 14-0 in a bitterly disappointing semi-final defeat at Wigan Warriors.\nShaun Wane's Wigan side booked a spot at Old Trafford next week by utterly out-playing the error-strewn visitors whose mistake-ridden display echoed their shoddy performance when losing against Leeds Rhinos in Manchester 12 months ago.\n\"I'm hugely disappointed,\" Powell said.\n\"And in the second half we panicked. There was nothing in the game; 11-0 is nothing with 20-odd minutes on the clock.\n\"I thought Wigan scrambled really well. But we were just not good enough and that’s two years on the trot that we have sat in the changing rooms at the end of the season really disappointed that you haven’t been able to do what you needed to do to win a big game, so there is clearly a mind-set change needed.\n“Our pre-season needs to reflect that and I’ve been thinking about that anyway, but I thought tonight just highlighted that our mentality as a collective needs to change a little bit.\n“We have got in the top-four again but when it gets down to the big games, it gets different and we aren’t good enough to win those games at the moment.\n\"So we have got to find a way of being able to convert that into wins and Grand Final wins.\n\"We're not going to be signing too many players so we've got to find a way.\nThe result followed on from a 26-0 loss at St Helens and Powell added: \"It's two weeks on the trot we haven't scored a point.\n\"We made a lot of errors in both games.\n\"We've had a really good year in trying circumstances. Over the whole season we finished third in the table but it's tempered by what happened tonight.\"\nIt seems bizarre but Castleford did badly miss the control and game-management of Jake Trueman, the 19-year-old half-back who broke a hand at Saints the previous week.\n“His kicking game is very dangerous and for a young player, he is very calm,\" admitted Powell.\n“Benny Roberts hasn’t played much at half-back this year and Jake was a miss for us, but injuries happen.\n\"He's broken his hand and if it was just that we might have risked him but he's done his scaphoid as well so we couldn't.\n\"We have been unlucky at times and Junior Moors was a miss as well. Hopefully we will get a bit more luck on the injury front next year.\nWigan coach Shaun Wane admits his emotions got the better of him after watching his side provide him with the chance to bow out on the big stage.\nVictory clinched a 10th Grand Final for the Warriors, with Wane now hoping to end his 30-year association with his home-town club as a champion.\n\"I don't cry very often but I did out there,\" said Wane, who will take up a role with the Scottish Rugby Union after next Saturday's clash with Warrington.\n\"It's emotional, it's been tough the last few weeks.\n\"I definitely didn't want to finish tonight, I wanted to finish next week, that's why we didn't celebrate that much tonight, the job is not done.\"\nWigan displayed all the defensive qualities instilled into them by Wane to snuff out the threat of the Tigers.\nScrum-half Thomas Leuluai marked his 250th appearance for the club with the opening try while full-back Sam Tomkins, one of three departing players, provided the finishing touches with a second-half try, along with a conversion, a penalty and two drop goals.\n\"I'm very pleased and proud,\" Wane added. \"It was a great effort.\n\"We weren't great with the ball, the conditions didn't lend",

They had a good game plan and executed it. We're going to be have to be better with the ball.\n\"It would mean absolutely everything if I could finish off with a win.

Commanders are not permitted to deny that leave. Fathers are given 10 days of paternity leave at the commander's discretion. Newly adoptive parents are granted three weeks of leave for one parent. Service members who foster parent are not given non-chargeable leave.\nPentagon officials have said they plan to ask Congress to expand paternity leave to 14 days for both a birth and an adoption as part of their Force of the Future personnel proposals. The proposals included no other expansions for adoptive or foster parents, and do not apply to parents who are not married to the father or mother of their child.\n",

Does Mr. Comey continue to enjoy the “special trust and confidence” of the American people, the rank-and-file of the FBI, and the thousands of government employees holding security clearances and access to classified information?\nOn Tuesday, July 5, 2016, Mr. Comey conducted a fifteen-minute press briefing detailing the elements of the crime of mishandling national defense information, specifically Title 18 U.S.C. §793(f) and the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of an outlaw email server.\nWith respect to Mrs. Clinton’s culpability in the compromise of national defense information to hostile actors, Mr. Comey stated: “We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.\nUnbelievably, having defined the elements of a national security crime and given specific examples of Mrs. Clinton’s reckless, dangerous conduct in each case, Mr. Comey concluded that “no charges are appropriate in this case” and that “no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” Mr. Comey did not tell the truth. Many people, in and out of government, know Mr. Comey’s blatant falsehood.\nExhibit A is the July 2015 prosecution of Bryan H. Nishimura, a Navy reservist in Sacramento, California, who plead guilty to charges – developed by Mr. Comey’s FBI – that represent a mere fraction of what Mr. Comey says Mrs. Clinton was involved in doing at the State Department.\nThe public’s faith in the fair administration of justice was damaged by Attorney General Lynch’s meeting with President Clinton on the tarmac in Phoenix. It was further damaged by the apparent sweetheart “voluntary interview” of Mrs. Clinton by the FBI on the Saturday of the July 4th weekend.\nThen just over 48 hours later (no doubt Mr. Comey spent the weekend carefully examining a year’s worth of interview transcripts), the proverbial stake was driven through the heart of any remaining faith and confidence in the public’s concept of “equal justice under law” or in Mr. Comey’s professional integrity by his nonsensical, contradictory, and insulting decision to let Mrs. Clinton “walk” on her national security crimes.

Mr. Comey knowingly gave Mrs. Clinton a “pass.” He is compromised.\nShould Mr. Comey continue as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation? No.\nChris Farrell is the Director of Investigations & Research for Judicial Watch and a member of the organization’s Board of Directors.

A month later, his girlfriend confirmed the death of the 26-year old in a Weibo post.\nWu, who had more than 60,000 followers of his Weibo account, was looking to win a prize of 100,000 yuan ($15,110) for a filmed stunt atop Huayuan Hua Centre in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, media said over the weekend.

        "prompt": "When hiring teachers, district leaders prioritize \"cultural fit\" above all else, including training and experience. But most are unable to measure what exactly that means.\nResearchers from the institute have previously found that district hiring managers prefer candidates who are recommended to them via word of mouth, even though the majority of candidates come from sources like commercial job boards. The researchers were concerned that this could hinder teacher diversity and increase teacher turnover, if the personal connection is prioritized over fit.\nIn this new study, researchers learned that most district hiring managers who prefer the candidates referred by word of mouth also emphasized cultural fit in their decisionmaking.\nThe vast majority of hiring managers considered cultural fit to be at least somewhat important—more so than any other hiring factor, including teacher training, teaching experience, racial and ethnic diversity, and geographic diversity.\nBut cultural fit is a nebulous term, and researchers learned that district managers cannot explain what exactly it means.\n\"There is no common definition,\" said Elizabeth Combs, the managing director of the institute and a co-author of the report. \"There is no definition that even individual hiring managers have articulated [on] what cultural fit means, and therefore there are very few folks measuring the extent to which they believe a candidate is qualified based on cultural fit.\"\nHiring for cultural fit extends beyond the education sector, and experts have said the practice could contribute to a lack of diversity across different industries, since people gravitate toward others with similar backgrounds. The teaching workforce is about 80 percent white.\nIn an essay for Harvard Business Review, Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix, urged employers to stop hiring for cultural fit and instead focus on people's skills.\n\"What most people really mean when they say someone is a good fit culturally is that he or she is someone they'd like to have a beer with,\" McCord wrote. \"But people with all sorts of personalities can be",
        "baseline": " great at the job you need done.\"\nOf course, districts have valid criteria that falls under the idea of cultural fit. For example, Combs said, one district wanted to ensure that all teachers who are hired have a growth mindset. But she said she's concerned that the overall emphasis on cultural fit could lead to unintentional bias that could undermine efforts to promote diversity—including racial, ethnic, and geographic.\n\"There needs to be a definition that is clearly articulated, and there needs to be some way of measuring candidates outside that definition,\" she said.\nTo that end, the institute's researchers recommend an \"information-rich\" hiring process, which could include things like sample lessons—something only 30 percent of responding hiring managers say they require.

Most won't get police any closer to finding the missing person.\n\"You don't want to say 'We got 100 leads yesterday, and 99 were dead-ends,'\" said Bill Moulder, Des Moines' longtime police chief who investigated the high-profile disappearances of Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin in the 1980s.\nThe boys, both Des Moines Register newspaper carriers, went missing on their early morning delivery routes in the Des Moines metro.\nGosch, 12, disappeared in 1982 and Martin, 13, went missing in 1984. Neither has been found.\nOftentimes, police are reluctant to release information because they feel it can hinder the investigation — or the abductor's prosecution, Moulder said.\nSome information withheld in the 2005 murder of 5-year-old Evelyn Miller helped lead to the conviction of her mother's boyfriend, for example.\n\"There are a lot of folks who don't want to say anything because it could compromise the investigation,\" said Moulder, who retired in 2003 and started his own consulting business, Moulder and Associates.\nMoulder said he leaned toward releasing information during his time as police chief. \"But I'm not in the majority,\" he added.\nHe said he sometimes butted heads with the county attorney, who was concerned evidence \"exposed in the newspaper\" would no longer being useful in the courtroom.\nInvestigators also face a lot of criticism during a missing person's case.\n\"Nobody wants to say we listened to three psychics and a fortune teller. People ask, 'Why the hell are they wasting their time,'\" Moulder said, adding that police will follow up on all credible tips.\nMissing persons cases are among the most difficult to solve, especially if a person is abducted by a stranger, he said.\nInvestigators are missing an important piece of information. \"There's no connection between the person and the stranger,\" he said. \"In personal crimes, the subject is connected to the victim — spouse, friend, competitor, someone they fought with.\n\"You have a starting point. But with a stranger abduction, there's no connection.\"\nThe longer a case goes, the former police chief said, \"the less the probability is of a good outcome.\"\n\"",
        "baseline": "A good outcome usually comes within days,\" Moulder said. But \"there are those outliers, where the person is found\" after months or years.\nElizabeth Smart was abducted at 14 in Salt Lake City and held for nine months before being rescued. And three women in Cleveland were imprisoned about a decade before escaping their captor.\nMoulder said families \"refuse to give up hope\" they'll find their missing loved one.\nNoreen Gosch, Johnny's mother, was \"heroic\" in keeping the teenager's investigation active for years, he said.\nAnd the fact that Tibbetts' family, friends and neighbors are keeping the Brooklyn, Iowa, woman in the public eye will help drive new tips and keep the investigation alive.\nIt's \"heavily dependent on whether there is additional evidence to follow up,\" Moulder said.\nPolice won't quit, either. \"Cops are realistic ... but they don't give up,\" he said.",

But for now, wealthy clients want in.\nTo be a client of Goldman’s Private Wealth Management division, which is doling out the shares, clients must have a net worth of at least $10 million. (That is the official cut-off, though plenty of Goldman clients are worth less).\nGoldman told clients in a memo this morning that in order to get Facebook shares, they need to commit at buy at least $2 million of the shares and are prohibited from selling them until 2013. Wealth advisers say a family needs to have a net worth of at least $30 million to feasibly invest $2 million in one stock that is illiquid for two years.\nIn an email, Goldman declined to comment on the deal or the terms to clients.\nClients also were told in this morning’s memo that the information about Facebook is highly confidential could constitute material nonpublic information if improperly disclosed. “This information is not to be used other than in connection with your investment,” the memo states.\nYet people familiar with the deal say it is likely to get subscriptions for as much as three or four times the amount available. So the allocation of the shares to clients is quickly turning into a hotly contested round of horse-trading to determine which clients get the most shares.\nClients asking for $2 million of shares, for instance, may",

        "prompt": "The Syrian civil war. Economic uncertainty. The China-Vietnam standoff in the South China Sea. High-frequency trading. Any or all of these factors, and many others, can roil markets and cause an upsurge in volatility, which in turn can wreak havoc on an equities portfolio. The fund industry has responded by launching a range of tools that purport to hedge the risk of uncertainty. One of the more popular methods to emerge in recent years is exchange-traded products (ETPs), such as ETFs and ETNs, tied to the VIX, which is the CBOE Market Volatility Index.\nTrading in these ETPs ostensibly gives investors an opportunity to profit when the VIX spikes, thereby offsetting potential losses in other areas of a portfolio.\nBut there is a major drawback to these products that many investors might be missing. The most popular VIX ETPs are not suitable for buy-and-hold investors because they are virtually guaranteed to lose money over time. In fact, since VIX ETPs first came to market beginning in 2009, they have chalked up aggregate losses in the billions of dollars.\nIn 1993, I developed the CBOE Market Volatility Index for the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In 2004 the index was modified by the CBOE. Since its creation, the VIX has become a very popular measurement of market anxiety, spiking during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. For example, the VIX spiked to 89.53 on October 24, 2008, on fears of the impending financial crisis.\nThe first generation of exchange-traded volatility products were launched in the U.S. by the CBOE as futures and options contracts written on the VIX. These date back to 2004 and 2006, respectively. For most investors futures are impractical and as a result the second-generation of volatility products, VIX ETPs, came on the scene three years later allowing wider access to the investing public.\nSince then, both the VIX futures and ETPs have become quite popular. In 2013, VIX futures trading volume hit a record high for the fourth year in a row, at nearly 40 million contracts — a jump of 65 percent over 2012. Last year, average daily trading volume also set a fourth-straight annual record, an increase over 67 percent from 2012. The VIX ETPs have demonstrated similar growth.\nBut for investors looking to hold VIX ETPs for longer than a very short period, these investments have serious drawbacks. First is the reality of widespread misunderstanding about current VIX products. Many investors in these products believe they are actually buying the CBOE's VIX. Hardly. VIX ETPs are securities created using complex VIX futures trading strategies. Close, but no VIX.\nThis leads to the second pitfall. Because these strategies demand daily rebalancing, they are subject to high management fees. Add other expenses such as futures commissions, and trading and licensing fees, and it's clear that investors can find themselves in a hole before they even start to consider their returns.\nBut, even in the absence of fees and expenses, the trading strategies these products follow are destined to lose money from the \"contango trap.\" The VIX futures market is said to be in contango when the futures price curve slopes upward. This situation dissolves VIX ETP returns over time.\nMy research found that the price curve sloped upwards on nearly 80 percent of all trading days for futures with 30-day maturities. This erosion happens because the price of longer-dated futures contracts is almost always higher than the price of shorter-dated futures contracts. VIX ETP managers, who base their products on trading these futures, must roll these futures contracts from one month to the next. But as they become more expensive (a \"negative roll\"), investors are hit with losses each month the price curve stays in contango.\nTo make matters worse, most VIX ETP investors cannot gauge the magnitude of the losses they will incur because they do not have access to real-time or end-of-day VIX futures prices. Nor do they realize that the mechanistic trading in the ETP makes holders vulnerable to pre-positioning by professional traders relating to the rebalancing of the underlying assets.\nGiven this nightmare scenario, what can investors who want to buy and hold VIX ETPs do? First, buy products based on the VIX Mid-Term index, not the short-term index. The price curve tends to be much flatter, and, thus, the losses due to the contango trap are considerably lower –",
        "baseline": " or incurred at a much slower rate.\nSecond, consider only VIX ETPs that offer interest accrual, whether by benchmarking to the Total Return indexes (such as VXX or VXY) or promising the return of the Excess Return index plus an explicating interest accrual.\nThird, keep an eye out for a new generation of VIX ETFs under development. They eliminate many of the expenses and negative roll problems of existing products, and put investors much closer to the VIX index itself. In short, they're ETFs that do what they say they're going to do, providing investors with true spot exposure to the VIX index.\nCommentary by Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University. He is known as \"The father of the VIX\" for developing the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) for the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1993. He is also a partner and special advisor to AccuShares, LLC.",

On July 14, HarperCollins will release Lee’s earliest known work, Go Set a Watchman, featuring characters from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which was published 55 years ago.\nIn honor of this landmark literary event, American Masters presents a newly updated version of Emmy®-winning filmmaker Mary McDonagh Murphy’s 2012 documentary Harper Lee: Hey, Boo, broadcast as Harper Lee: American Masters on Friday, July 10, 9 – 10:30 pm on PBS (check local listings) The author of Scout, Atticus & Boo: A Celebration of To Kill a Mockingbird, Murphy was able to read an advance copy of the new novel before updating the film and will live tweet (#HarperLeePBS) during the broadcast.\n“Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill a Mockingbird and believed to be lost or destroyed. Its remarkable discovery allows readers of Lee’s beloved classic the chance to see Atticus and Scout again. How and why this happened is a mystery we unravel in the new version of the documentary,” said Murphy.\nLee once said she wanted to be South Alabama’s Jane Austen, but became an enigma when she stopped speaking to press in 1964 after her whirlwind success. Harper Lee: American Masters offers an unprecedented look at Lee’s life, illuminates the phenomenon behind To Kill a Mockingbird and the Oscar®-winning 1962 film adaptation, and previews Go Set a Watchman, which Lee wrote in 1957. The documentary features interviews with Lee’s friends and family – including her centenarian sister Alice (now deceased) – who share intimate recollections, anecdotes and biographical details for the first time: Lee’s rise from small-town Alabama girl to famous author, her tumultuous friendship with Truman Capote, and the origin of her most memorable characters: Atticus Finch, his daughter Scout, her friend Dill, and Boo Radley.\nThe film also explores the context and history of the novel’s Deep South setting and the social changes it inspired after publication and through the feature film starring Gregory Peck. Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, Pulitzer Prize-winners Rick Bragg, Anna Quindlen, Richard Russo, Jon Meacham and Diane McWhorter, James Patterson, Wally Lamb, Scott Turow, civil rights leader Andrew Young, and others reflect on the novel’s power, influence, popularity, and the ways it has shaped their lives.\n“Harper Lee was ahead of her time. She challenged the social order and made a cultural impact with To Kill a Mockingbird that still resonates today. I’m thrilled that American Masters is able to give viewers a sneak peek at Lee’s new novel,” said Michael Kantor, executive producer of American Masters.\nOprah Winfrey – TV and film producer, founder of O, The Oprah magazine, radio",

        "prompt": "WASHINGTON — An Army program meant to increase the number of recruits during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars devolved into an illegal free-for-all that could cost taxpayers close to $100 million, military investigators say, describing new details of what they called a long-running scheme among National Guard recruiters that went undetected for years.\nArmy officials appeared before a Senate hearing on Tuesday and sketched out a huge criminal endeavor that has implicated more than 1,200 people — 200 of them officers — including two generals and dozens of colonels. Criminal investigators for the Army said soldiers, civilians and National Guard recruiters had used the program as a “bounty” from which they could illegally collect money for recruiting soldiers they had not recruited.\nSenator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and chairwoman of the Senate panel holding a hearing, was visibly irate and repeatedly expressed anger and surprise as she listened to Army investigators describe the fraud they say took place under a program that began in 2005 at the height of the Iraq war to address an enlistment shortfall in the Army National Guard.\nUnder the program, National Guard soldiers — and their relatives, as well as other civilians and retirees — signed up to be recruiting assistants and could earn up to $7,500 for each new recruit they managed to enlist. But investigators said that in many cases, high school guidance counselors and even principals with access to their students’ personal information took credit for recruiting students who they happened to know were joining the Army.\nIn the end, according to Maj. Gen. David E. Quantock, commanding general of the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, fraudulent payments that have already reached $29 million could, by the end of the investigation, come close to $100 million.\n“So there were high school counselors who heard there was a bounty and knew kids were signing up for the military, so they went and took advantage of this?” Ms. McCaskill said.\nOne person who is now under prosecution was fraudulently paid $275,000 under the recruitment program, and four others received more than $100,000 each, according to papers released Monday by the Senate panel.\nSome recruiting assistants eligible for bonuses were coerced into splitting them with military recruiters, who were barred from getting payments themselves. Other military recruiters did not tell their civilian assistants about the bonuses, but registered them for the program, and then substituted their own bank information for their civilian assistants, army officials said.\nThe bonuses helped the Army increase enlistment during the war years; in return the Army paid more than $300 million for 130,000 new recruits. The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post in 2012.\nAfter reports of potential fraud in 2007, the Army examined the program and found that 705 recruiters were linked to payments with a high risk of fraud, including multiple large recruiting bonuses going into the same bank accounts. Federal prosecutors have indicted several former recruiters and soldiers accused of abusing the bonus program.\nThe investigation comes at a fraught time for the Army, just as the country is moving away from the military buildup of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and grappling with issues of a smaller military with an attendant smaller budget. The Pentagon is already experiencing budget cuts and its programs are being squeezed; any perception that money is being stolen may provide additional fodder for those",
        "baseline": " who are already critical of a large military.\nThe Army terminated the recruiting bonus program in February 2012 and ordered a wholesale review. Officials say that they may not finish the investigation until 2016 because of the scale of the fraud.\nNine cases were investigated between 2007 and 2009, General Quantock said. He said it was not until 2010, when 10 cases surfaced, that investigators realized that they had a major, widespread problem.\n“That’s a long time when you’ve got fraud going on,” said Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire.\nLt. Gen. Clyde A. Vaughn, former director of the Army National Guard, defended the recruiting program as necessary and effective, but acknowledged that he was unaware of the abuses at the time.\n“I told them: We got to catch the first peckerwoods to get out here and mess this thing up for everybody, and we got to prosecute them quickly,” General Vaughn said.",
        "llm_baseline": "don’t want to cut the military budget.The Army has already taken steps to prevent personnel fraud in the program,including requiring that recruiters and their families sign a waiver certifying that they have not committed fraud.“We’ve already taken a number of steps to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,”said Maj.Gen.Jeffrey Snow,the Army’s deputy chief of staff for personnel fraud. But Ms.McCaskill said she’snot happy with the Army’s response.“I’m not sure that we’re going to be able to get to the bottom of this,’’she said.“I’m not sure that we’re going to be able to get to the bottom of this,’’she said.”http:/www.nytimes.com/ news/2015/03/27/nytimes.com/news/2015/03/27/nytimes.com/news/2015/03/27/nytimes.com/news/2015/03/27/nytime.nytimes.com//news/2015/03/27/nytimes.com/army-says-personal-fraud-is-rife-with-fraud-fraud-is-rife-with-fraud.html?ref=",

        "prompt": "As a young adult cancer patient, I have developed a healthy addiction to blogging.\nIt began after I wrote a book. When I hit \"send\" on the final manuscript for my take on cancer among people in their 20s and 30s, I expected to feel elated; instead I felt an anxious void. Obsessing over those words had been my best distraction from thinking about the two tumors perched near my jugular vein. So the next morning I started a blog.\nDiagnosed with cancer at 27, I was a tell-all, social butterfly. Nearly a decade later, I was still living with cancer as a quieter, more private woman. I did not want to blog in diarylike detail about my tumor markers or Synthroid dosage. Instead, my blog, Everything Changes (everythingchangesbook.com), now focuses on questions common to most cancer patients: Does cancer make you strong? Have you reached your breaking point? How do you mesh illness and intimacy?\nMy doctor has prescribed high doses of thyroid hormones to curb my cancer growth. As a result, my brain metabolism is fast and my mind speedy. When I have insomnia, I write in solitude and post my thoughts online. By morning they are transformed into a conversation among myself, perfect strangers and patients I have come to know well in the blogosphere but have never met in person.\nAmong my fellow bloggers are Jennifer Starr-Reivitt and Nicole McMaster, who began blogging as an easy way to keep friends and relatives updated on their health status without making tiring phone calls. Each soon gained a following among other breast cancer patients who were researching the topic using search engines.\nAt the request of friends, Starr-Reivitt, an ordained pastor who lives in Michigan, posted on her blog photographs of her reconstructed breast and the healing process of her post-surgical wound. She considered removing the photos from her blog, Clergygirl (clergygirl.wordpress.com), but changed her mind when she realized other patients in the same predicament were viewing the pictures.\n\"Someone out there is wondering if their wound will ever heal. I've decided to leave my pictures up because I know these photos will give them hope,\" she said.\nMcMaster has found a more supportive community through blogging than at the breast cancer support group she attended, where she was one of only two young women and felt pitied by the older patients around her. Her blog, Throws Like a Girl (throwslikeagirl74.wordpress.com), began as a knitting blog before her diagnosis. It now attracts mothers with cancer, who discuss issues such as parenting, surgery and painkillers.\nLike me, Katherine Burton began her blog after cancer treatment, a time when her physical and emotional side effects were the greatest, yet doctor visits and support were fading away.\n\"My therapist said to me, 'Kate, your blog is actually doing more to help you than I am,'\" Burton recalled. \"I have so many journals with only three pages of entries. Journaling never made a lot of sense to me. Blogging is not only self-expression but you are also communicating with others.\"\nAfter Cancer Now What (aftercancernowwhat.com) includes her personal breast cancer experiences, plus news on cancer research and advocacy, and information about health care reform.\nCancer patients are a remarkably considerate group of bloggers. I have never encountered backlash comments or cyberstalking",
        "baseline": ".\nThe downside of cancer blogging comes instead in the form of silence. When a friend drops off the blogosphere, you sometimes never know why. Maybe they are in remission and no longer need the support that blogging once brought them. Maybe they are at a PTA meeting, are working or, despite their missing body parts and bald head, have found a new boyfriend or girlfriend and are occupied with love instead of cancer. Or maybe their health took a turn for the worse.\nHow to get started There is no escaping the day-to-day reality of living with cancer, but blogging can help ease the sting.

        "prompt": "THE future may be bright – but could it be powered by living organisms? Glowee, a start-up in Paris has started selling bioluminescent lights to illuminate shop fronts and street signs.\nAfter a demonstration in December, the French company has launched its first product – a bacteria-powered light that glows for three days. The company is now working on lights that will glow for a month or more.\nThe lights are made by filling small transparent cases with a gel containing bioluminescent bacteria. Glowee uses a bacterium called Aliivibrio fischeri, which gives marine animals such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid the ability to glow with a blue-green light. The gel provides nutrients that keep the bacteria alive.\nAt first, the lights only worked for a few seconds. But by tweaking the consistency of the gel, the team has been able to extend the bacteria’s lifespan to three days.\nBioluminescent lights are not new. But Glowee is one of the first companies to develop a commercial product. Initially, the lights are being marketed to shops. In France, retailers are not allowed to light their shop windows between 1 am and 7 am to limit light pollution and energy consumption. The softly glowing bacterial lights – about as bright as night lights",
        "baseline": " – provide a way to get around the ban.\nGlowee also suggests using them as decorative lighting and on building exteriors – as well as providing lighting in places with no power cables, such as parks.\nHow feasible is the idea in the long run? Edith Widder at the Ocean Research & Conservation Association in Fort Pierce, Florida, thinks the costs of producing and maintaining large numbers of bioluminescent bacteria in suitable environmental conditions are too high for most commercial lighting needs.\nBut Glowee is undeterred. Having adjusted the gel, the company is now genetically engineering the bacteria. Rey says her team is developing a molecular switch that will activate the bioluminescence only at night. This will let the bacteria save energy during the day and make the nutrients last longer.\nThe team also plans to make the bacteria glow brighter and survive temperature fluctuations of up to 20°C. The aim is to launch a product in 2017 that lasts for a month.",
        "llm_baseline": ",it could be a great solution.Glowee is also working on LED lights that will glow for a year or more.The company is also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“We are working on a way to make the bacteria more efficient,“says Pierre Paslier,co-founder of Glowee.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“The company is also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“We are working on a way to make the bacteria more efficient,”says Pierre Paslier,co-founder of Glowee.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient,”says Pierre Paslier,co-founder of Glowee.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient,”says Pierre Paslier,co-founderof Glowee.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“The company is also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“We are working on a way to make the bacteria more efficient,”says Pierre Paslier,co-founder of Glowee.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.“We are also looking at ways to make the lights more efficient.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

        "prompt": "Art Basel Miami Beach 2015, came and went in another blaze of glory. Despite wet weather, parking overload and other logistical interludes, the world’s most important annual art show enhanced by satellite fairs continued to impact the local and global art scene.\nIt’s a mega economic driver for the city too. According to Beacon Council executive vice president Steve Beatus, Art Basel’s far-reaching economic impact can be likened to having a Superbowl in Miami each day of Art Week.\nIt’s been a wild ride ever since Art Basel Miami Beach, the sister show of the Swiss-based fair, propelled Miami and Miami Beach to center stage on the international culture circuit. Over the past 13 years, Art Basel’s palette of established and emerging artists, collectors and cutting-edge works of art generated energy that lasted well beyond one wild week in December.\nAt the same time, an unprecedented building boom provided a fitting setting for people interested in cultural offerings. Today, Miami can claim to be one of the world’s great cities with great contemporary art in private and public collections.\nToday, Miami ranks third, after New York and London, in the artsy list of the Most influential Art World cities. This booming arts scene connects real estate and high-end buyers, illustrated by the number of private jet flights to Miami for Art Basel 2015, nearly 800.\nHere, the fun-in-the-sun playground pulsates with the rhythm of a unique arts scene and cultural life. Miami’s location at the crossroads of Latin America– a richly creative, diverse and sophisticated population and a natural enthusiasm for varied cultural experiences, makes this a top home-owning destination to delight in.\nNo longer confined to traditional museums and galleries, contemporary art is flourishing all around town. From the explosive colors and images of Wynwood Walls to repurposed warehouses and pop-up displays during the monthly neighborhood Art Walks, Miami showcases art everywhere.\nMany developers are also art collectors, connoisseurs and patrons intent on harnessing the emotional power of contemporary art in their buildings.\nAmong the best known are Related Group’s Jorge Perez, a sponsor of the Perez Art Museum; Marty Margulies, father of the eponymous Collection at the Warehouse; and",

His art and cultural center will feature a new kind of multidisciplinary center in a flexible building that can house dance, theater, political debates, lectures and a wide range of other cultural happenings.\nMiami real estate professionals savvy about the burgeoning art scene can relate to cosmopolitan customers. Many new high-rise projects are marketed with a cultural component that imbues them with a special sense of value and sophistication.\nResidents of luxury condominiums can engage with art in their own surroundings while agents communicate to buyers the cachet and sense of identity in buildings designed by starchitects or featuring commissioned art works.\nBeth embodies impressive accomplishments from her 30 year career span.

All the students who were hospitalized were released by noon on March 15.\nNo conclusive evidence has been presented yet that Aramark, the food service provider for both SHSU and the University of Houston, is at fault. The Department of Health and the Center for Disease Control are, along with Aramark, conducting an investigation into the cause.\nNo previous health inspections at SHSU have found serious problems with the food service, and the health department inspected all the dining facilities on campus and declared them safe Sunday.\nThe investigators are conducting interviews and taking lab cultures of food and water to determine the cause of the outbreak, and results should be available Thursday. All SHSU Aramark employees were tested for bacterial contamination, and all test results were negative.\nThough the bacteria might be a type of E. coli, the lab workers believe that the germs are probably not E. coli 0157, the deadly type of E. coli that has received so much publicity recently.\nThe food service director at SHSU did say that they have chosen to \"increase ... employee training in safety and sanitation to further ensure the safety of the food from the time of delivery to the time of service.\n\"We have instituted a process by which we test the food at various stages of production so that we can monitor its safety.\"\nIn order to insure the safety of the food, all opened containers were thrown out over spring break, he said.\nFood poisoning can be caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites and can get into the food before or after it gets to the kitchen. Raw meat often has germs that could cause food poisoning, and occasionally plumbing problems can cause water to become contaminated. The best defense against transmitting germs through food is hand washing.\nSpokesman for SHSU Frank Krystyniak said that, if the investigations do show that Aramark is responsible for the illness, the university will not take",

Aramark has been the food-service provider on this campus for more than 30 years.\nThe new contract will be for all UH campuses. On May 1, the system-wide committee will make a recommendation to Randy Harris, vice president/vice chancellor for administration and finance. He will make the recommendation to Chancellor Arthur K. Smith, who will then make the recommendation to the Board of Regents.\nThe new contract will begin in August 1998 for seven years with three one-year options for extension.\nThe committee chair, Vice President of Student Affairs Elwin Lee was not available to comment on whether the outcome of the food poisoning investigation will affect the committee's decision about awarding the contract.",

        "prompt": "There is still at least one more game to play. And, with the Bay Area fans possibly taking an exception, if the basketball gods are on our side, we’ll get to a Game 7.\nRegardless of the fact that the Cleveland Cavaliers are in a 3-2 hole to the Golden State Warriors, LeBron James was still confident about how the Cavs could fare against the Warriors after their 104-91 Game 5 loss.\n\"I feel confident because I'm the best player in the world,\" James said after his Game 5 performance. \"It's that simple.\"\nJames garnered his fair share of criticism for the comments. But if hadn’t said it, someone else would: right here right now, James truly is best in the world.\nBut beyond all that, James is giving a performance for the ages. Not Michael. Not Larry. Not Magic. Nobody has performed at the levels we’ve seen in these Finals.\nIn fact, even if the Cavaliers lose, James should be the Finals MVP. It’s that simple. And, throwing out the “the MVP has to come from the winning team” it should be more than obvious. Barring some clunker the rest of the way (fat chance) or injury (never out of the question), the Finals MVP is already James’.\nDon’t act shocked. It’s happened once before, albeit 46 years ago. Jerry West won the Finals MVP in 1969 after the Los Angeles Lakers lost to Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics in 7 games.\nSo, there’s history that says you can give the MVP to someone off the losing team. And there’s eye-popping numbers to back it all up.\nTo this point, there has never been a player in Finals history that has scored an average of 35 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in the Finals. No one. James is currently posting an average of 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Throw in an average of 1.2 steals for good measure. He’s logged a heart-stopping 45.6 minutes per game out of a total of 48 minutes in a game. All told, he’s played 228 minutes carrying the load. According to Crain’s Cleveland, if LeBron keeps the numbers up, he’ll be the first player since Shaquille O’Neal in 2002 to average 35 points and 10 boards in the Finals.\nLook at how the rest of the Cavs are shooting in these Finals. J.R. Smith is shooting 30.6 percent. Matthew Dellavedova is hitting 30 percent of his shots. Iman Shumpert is hitting an anemic 27 percent. So, while James' percentage from the field isn’t looking that great (65 for 163 or 39.9 percent), it’s been the will of James to try and carry the Cavaliers. He has to shoot that many.\nTo put this in comparison to the Warriors, regular season MVP Stephen Curry is averaging 26.2 points, 5.8 assists, and 5 rebounds. He’s Golden State’s highest scorer. But then, Klay Thompson is averaging 18 points, Andre Iguodala averages 14.6, and Draymond Green is dropping an average of 12.4 points per game. Go back to those stats from LeBron. He’s scoring an average of more than 10 points per game more than Curry, and twice the rebounds. Where is Curry beating James handily? In assists. Why? Because Curry has help.\nJames currently has 4,988 career playoff points and needs only 12 points to become the sixth player with 5,000 in the postseason. The top five are Michael Jordan (5,987 points), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5,762), Kobe Bryant (5,640), Shaquille O'Neal (5,250) and Tim Duncan (5,113). This would be just the latest milestone for James. During Game 5 of The Finals, James tied Karl Malone for third all time in free throws made in the playoffs (1,269); supplanted Jason Kidd for sixth in steals in the playoffs (303); and climbed to ninth in minutes played in the playoffs (7,515), moving ahead of Michael Jordan (7,474) and Bill Russell (7,497). James is 23 minutes behind eighth-place Magic Johnson and 44 behind seventh-place Wilt Chamberlain.\nLeBron James' two triple-doubles in the series matches the record for a single Finals (shared with Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, according to the Elias Sports Bureau) and equals the number he had in the 2013 Finals with the Miami Heat against the San Antonio Spurs. The only other player with",
        "baseline": " two triple-doubles in more than one Finals is Johnson, who did it three times (1984, 1985, 1991). As for career triple-doubles in The Finals, James (six) is second to Johnson (eight).\nAnd all of this is through Game 5. Is there little doubting that LeBron will be going off in Game 6 with the Cavs on the brink of elimination?\nMaybe LeBron shouldn’t have said he was the best player on the planet. Maybe that was simply the obvious. Through five games, the 2015 Finals have pulled unbelievable television ratings for Walt Disney-owned ABC, largely because it’s been a compelling and mostly tight and competitive series. Part of it is the “MVP vs. Runner-Up” story in Curry against James. And some of it simply has been watching one of—if not the greatest performances in Finals history—from LeBron James. Give him the Finals MVP. He more than deserves it.",

        "prompt": "Jewish settlers torched a mosque near Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on December 15.\nEarlier that week, Jewish rightists set fire to a mosque in Jerusalem. They scrawled graffiti on the walls reading “Mohammed is a pig,” and “A good Arab is a dead Arab.” Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat condemned the desecration of the religious site. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did the same in October when a mosque was burned in the north of the country.\n“The images are shocking and do not belong in the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said.\nBut such statements belie the Israeli government’s long-standing attitude towards Muslim religious properties or waqf. Meaning literally endowment, waqf and income from waqf serves a charitable purpose for one’s family or community. Under Ottoman rule, waqf properties were exempt from taxes.\nFollowing the 1947-1948 nakba, which saw some 700,000 Palestinians driven from their homes, Israel used its newly created Absentees’ Property Law to seize, among other things, waqf.\nJaffa was renamed Yafo in 1948 and was annexed by the Tel Aviv municipality between 1948 and 1949. Most of the mosques were closed and several later became Jewish-owned art galleries.\nIn 2007, attorney Hisham Shabaita, three other Palestinian residents of Jaffa, and a local human rights organization, filed a lawsuit against the state of Israel, the Custodian of Absentee Property, and the Jewish Israeli trustees responsible for administering Tel Aviv-Yafo’s waqf holdings. The plaintiffs didn’t ask for the land back. Nor did they request compensation. They simply wanted to know what had happened to the properties, what their estimated earnings were, and where the money was going or had gone.\nThe court’s response? The information cannot be released because it apparently would embarrass the state, harming its reputation in the international community. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal and the case is expected to reach the Israeli Supreme Court.\nBut it’s not hard to guess what happened to the waqf properties, in part because the state admitted that all of the land had been sold. There are other clues: in the 1950s alone, the state demolished 1200 mosques. Later, the Hilton hotel, which stands in an area now known as north Tel Aviv, was built on a Muslim cemetery. Bodies were unearthed and relocated, stacked upon each other in a tiny corner of what was once a large graveyard.\nAnother Muslim cemetery became a parking lot for Tel Aviv University.\nThere are also the forgotten corners, properties the state appropriated and then neglected. The Sheikh Murad cemetery, which dates back to at least the 1800s, stands between the South Tel Aviv neighborhoods of Shapira and Kiryat Shalom. Its headstones were smashed by vandals years ago. Bits of marble have been pried off the graves, presumably for use or sale.\nLocals have dumped garbage on the grounds and, the last time I checked in on the cemetery—not long after Muslim and Christian graves were vandalized in Yafo—two men were shooting heroin under the shade of a pomegranate tree. Fruit rotted on the ground.\nAbu Shehadeh says that the local Islamic committee is building a fence around the cemetery in hopes of protecting it from further misuse. He adds that only Palestinian collaborators with Israel, who are often relocated to South Tel Aviv, have been buried in the graveyard since 1948.\nThe Jewish neighborhoods Kiryat Shalom and Kfar Shalem both stand on the land of the Palestinian village Salame, which was established before the 1596 Ottoman census. According to Abu Shehadeh, a number of Muslim cemeteries were destroyed to make way to house the country’s new occupants.\nWith the approval of the Jerusalem municipality, the Simon Wiesenthal Center is building a “Museum of Tolerance” on a Muslim graveyard. Excavations are taking place at the site, which has served as a been a parking lot for several decades now, and skeletons are being exhumed so that the Los Angeles-headquartered, “global Jewish human rights” organization can teach tourists a thing or two about co-existence.\nSergio Yahni of the Alternative Information Center, an Israeli-Palestinian non-governmental organization, explained that much of Jewish West Jerusalem is built on waqf.\nSeveral Palestinians who disappeared from the Old City during the war were believed to be killed during the demolitions.\nThis occurred in the area adjacent to the Al Aqsa Mosque. Some eighty percent of the Old City’s Jewish Quarter is built on waqf.\nThis article was originally published in Al Akhbar.\n“Some eighty percent of the Old City’s Jewish Quarter is built on waqf.” This sentence, in the context of the story in which it appears, seems to imply that foreign Jewish settlers actually came and took over the Jewish Quarter of the Old City as part of this post-1948 process of destruction that you are describing.\nThis rather odd statement seems to delegitimize, across broad historic periods, even Jewish residence – irrespective of the separate issue of Jewish or Israeli sovereignty or administrative authority – in Jerusalem.\nThis despite the fact that there has been a Jewish residential presence in this section of the city for thousands of years.\nI suspect those Palestinian Jews with historic family roots in Jerusalem dating back hundreds or thousands of years might be surprised to learn from this story of their implied association with the process of destruction and delegitimization of the Palestinian Muslim and Christian presence which did in fact take place in the city starting in 1948.\nOf course, the Arabs tore down and desecrated most if not all of the synagogue and Jewish cemeteries they go their hands on after the 1948 war. Most famous was taking the the tombstones from the ancient Mt of Olives cemetery and using them for latrines, the desecreation of the Torah scrolls from the 50+ synagogues and yeshivot destroyed in the Jewish Quarter of the Old city and in Hevron, not to mention the destruction and defiling of the building themselves, just like we saw more recently with the synagogues of Gush Katif.\nSo as they say here in Israel TEKU! A tie. I’ll start worrying about their waqf when they start worrying about what they did to Jewish stuff.\nBen Israel, Thanks for reading. But, as usual, I feel like your topic is off-topic. The post is about Israel’s treatment of waqf and the hypocrisy of leaders’ reactions to recent incidents of vandalism and arson. This post is not about Arab treatment of Jewish properties. Do you have anything to say about Israel’s treatment of waqf?\nMati, I’m sure you’re aware that the continual Jewish residence you’re speaking of constituted a small minority.\nHere’s a number for you: the Old City’s Jewish Quarter is, today, 4 times it’s pre-1948 size.\nThat’s not to say that there weren’t Jews in Jerusalem before 48. It’s to say that the demographics and the use of the land was totally different.\nMya I’m with you on those comments. Ben, I don’t hold you up as a nutcase rightwinger; though I agree with few of your views, you do usually argue for them logically and lucidly. ‘They did it first’ isn’t only off topic but it’s below par for yourself and doesn’t move the debate on.\nMany, if not most of the articles posted at 972 show how Israel is a terrible country that stomps on human rights, is racist, is violent, etc, etc. These are posted on a Left-wing, “progressive” web site designed for a Leftist, “progressive” audience in order, conciously or not, to show Israel is not a fit country for the civilized world, at lease as the Leftist, “progressive” world defines civilization.\nNot all articles are like that, some show a certain degree of balance, but this one doesn’t. My point is that the Arabs did all the things Israel is accused of doing, even worse, (although since Israel won the war, it had more Islamic “holy sites” fall into its hands). In fact, I am sure that during the partition of India, Muslims and Hindus did the same, also during the population transfer between Greece and Turkey did the same . Israel is NO DIFFERENT than anyone else in the same situation. That is why this article is unfair and misleading. I want to point this out.\nThere are two synagogues in Cairo that the Egyptian government has taken care to preserve and that are under heavy police guard. (I’ve seen them both and entered one).\nThe Magen Abraham synagogue in Beirut which was damaged during the Civil War was recently restored with permission of the Lebanese government and (gasp!) Hezbollah.\nIn the future, please keep your comments on topic or I will not allow them to appear in the discussion.\nAnd, I might point out the obvious, Ben Israel… even if Israel is “no different” than anyone else, that doesn’t excuse anything. Israel is still accountable for its actions.\nMya, with all due respect, I am not so impressed that a country restores/maintains a couple of synagogues. How they treat their Jews (the negligible amount that are left in these countries) is what interests me.\nBen Israel: Your last two comments have both been so far off topic I have deleted them.\nIf you want to stay on topic, you are welcome to participate in the conversation.\nIf not, I won’t",
        "baseline": " allow you to clutter the thread.\n@Ben: “My neighbor beats his wife, so why shouldn’t I do it too?” = not a winning argument.\nI would also suggest if you’re going to go back to a few decades pre-1948, why not go all the way back to 0 A.D. and we can see there has been nastiness by every group who took over Jerusalem – blood flowing through the streets by Crusader murder is nothing compared to waqf abuse. However, the point is we want to live differently now as humans. As a result the “look what they did” argument is not very appealing to most people because they wish for more from humans and from this state. If you think striving for more from Israel by offering criticism is meant to “show how terrible Israel is” – please deal with your insecurities so we don’t nose dive into a failed state here.",

        "prompt": "The House voted Friday to extend a pay freeze for federal workers, already in effect for more than two years, for another nine months.\nRepublicans, who largely backed the measure, said it would save $11 billion in the long run and that economically secure public servants could go a little longer without a raise.\nMost Democrats, and the White House, criticized the bill as an example of anti-government bias and said Republicans, instead of debating a bill that has little chance of advancing in the Democratic-controlled Senate, should be concentrating on avoiding the pending automatic cuts to federal programs that could have a painful effect on the economy.\nThe House measure, approved on a 261-154 vote, blocks an executive order issued by President Barack Obama last December that would give the nation&apos;s 2 million civilian federal workers a 0.5 percent cost-of-living raise from March 27, when the current federal spending agreement expires, through the end of the year.\nThe White House has indicated it will also include a 1 percent federal pay increase in its 2014 budget proposal.\nThe White House, in a statement, opposed the House bill, saying federal workers have already done more than their part in bringing down the deficit and that the legislation was added burden on those who \" assure the safety of this country&apos;s food and airways, defend the homeland, provide health care to the nation&apos;s veterans, search for cures to devastating diseases and provide vital support to our troops at home and abroad.\"\nObama in 2010 initiated a two-year freeze on federal COLAs as part of an effort to reduce the deficit. Federal worker unions and others opposing the bill say that, with the freeze and higher pension contributions required of new workers, federal employees are already helping save $103 billion over a 10-year period.\nBut the bill&apos;s sponsor, freshman Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., said his \"modest\" bill \"simply recognizes our current fiscal reality and the fact that government salaries must bear some relationship to the private sector salaries that support them.\" His bill, estimated at saving $11 billion over 10 years, would also extend the freeze on congressional member pay, now running through September, until the end of the year.\nThe freeze only applies to cost-of-living adjustments, and not merit and longevity raises. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee cited figures showing that, with merit-based raises and other \"step\" increases, the median pay for a federal employee in September last year was $72,714, up more than $3,000 from two years earlier. Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the pay freeze would cost each employee $274 for the year.\nThose supporting the freeze say the average federal worker compensation, including benefits, is nearly double the median U.S. household income. They point to a 2012 Congressional Budget Office study showing that, while wages are similar for federal workers and comparable private sector workers, federal workers on the whole had more generous benefit packages. Overall, it said, total compensation is 16 percent higher in the public sector.\nBut federal worker unions rely on Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys showing that in most localities federal employees trail behind private sector counterparts in wages. This is most evident for more highly educated employees who give up lucrative opportunities in the private sector to serve the public.\nNational Treasury Employees Union president Colleen M. Kelley said the House bill was \"a particularly galling step in light of the fact that federal workers have contributed far more than any other group to economic recovery and deficit reduction.\"\nOpponents warned that government workers will also be the first to be hit if Congress fails to find a way to avert $85 billion in automatic spending cuts to occur at the end of this month or come up with a new spending plan when the current law",

David Cox.\nOne of the harshest critics of the bill was Republican Frank Wolf, whose northern Virginia district includes many federal workers. \"This bill is nothing more than a political stunt that targets the hardworking, dedicated men and women of the civil service,\" he said in a letter to his GOP colleagues, reminding them that people who haven&apos;t seen a raise in more than two years include CIA and FBI agents, border and customs agents, nurses and doctors at VA facilities, food inspectors, firefighters at national forests and NASA astronauts and engineers.\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, there were about 2.1 million civilian workers in 2011.

        "prompt": "Horton Foote makes heavy demands on theatergoers, if they are to attend all three works of his trilogy now playing at Hartford Stage.\nThis actually comprises nine dramas, since the acts in each play are entities unto themselves.\nDefined appropriately as an epic, the trilogy follows the fortunes of three interrelated families over three decades, beginning at the turn of the last century.\nAnd, under the direction of Artistic Director Michael Wilson, 22 actors play out some 70 roles.\n\"The Orphans' Home Cycle,\" which Foote began in the '70s and completed shortly before his death several months ago, is essentially autobiographical. It reaches back into the history of his immediate and extended family.\nCentering on his own father, depicted here as Horace Robedaux, the first play (titled \"The Story of a Childhood\") covers Robedaux's early years.\nThe second (\"The Story of a Marriage\") follows Robedaux through young adulthood, and the last (\"The Story of a Family\") moves into the next generation.\nThe middle piece, \"The Story of a Marriage\" (attended by this reviewer), looks at his parents' courtship and marriage.\nOpening in 1912 in Foote's imaginary town of Harrison (a stand-in for Foote's own Wharton, Texas), it follows the adventures of the 20-year-old Horace.\nThis sensitive, idealistic young man is painted in glowing colors. After the disappointing pursuit of a pretty widow, he eventually finds the girl of his dreams--Elizabeth Vaughan--whom he marries despite her parents' objections.\nThe drama presents the couple's early years and their idyllic marriage. No doubt the years which separate past and present contribute to Foote's slanted view of his forebears.\nYet the playwright endows his characters with such folksy realism that one forgives this tendency to idealize. The first two acts focus in on the hero's dilemmas, and steadily build in intensity.\nBut the third act, alas, is weakened by byways, as it sketches numerous small- town characters not immediately relevant to the plot.\nYet Wilson is clearly devoted to the playwright and his material, and directs with a sure hand.",
        "baseline": " And Wilson, like Foote himself, has a strong sense of place. This is a convincing depiction of small-town life in east Texas. The first act, in particular, has the charm of an old sepia photograph (owing much to the design team -- Jeff Cowie and David Barber (set), Rui Rita (lighting), and David C. Woolard (costumes).\nA fine, substantial cast is topped by Bill Heck as Horace, Maggie Lacey as Elizabeth, and Virginia Kull as the widow Claire. And James DeMarse is memorable as Elizabeth's unyielding father. Hallie Foote (an esteemed actress who is the foremost interpreter of her father's work), plays Elizabeth's mother.\nBut the stiff character she portrays in this second play allows little scope for her considerable skills.\nSo much for minor quibbles. Undoubtedly this trilogy, as so much of Horton Foote's work, will continue to have appeal for years to come.",

Thousands of people are out, thronging sidewalks, parks, riverbank walkways and bridges over the water.\nRestaurants and sidewalk cafes are packed. The crowd is mixed, with everyone from elderly couples to young families with babies in strollers and groups of teens in matching tee shirts emblazoned with school colors.\nThe atmosphere is festive. People are dancing to music played by street musicians, consulting a guidebook and using mobile devices to check their location and the next attraction they’d like to see.\nNo, this is not Florence, Italy, in high tourist season. It's Grand Rapids, Mich., a Western Michigan city whose population explodes every fall during a wildly popular festival called ArtPrize.\nArtPrize, which ended its fifth season last Saturday after a two-and-a-half-week run, is a runaway success that attracted an estimated 400,000 people to this city of 190,000, spinning off millions of dollars in economic impact while filling the streets with picture-snapping art lovers.\n\"Discern,\" an installation by Jason Ackman, was on view during ArtPrize in Grand Rapids, Mich.\nArtPrize, seemingly overnight, has become a premier cultural event in the Midwest. It also offers lessons galore for its sorry competitor in Cleveland, Ingenuity Fest.\nI’m speaking here specifically of the visual arts component of Ingenuity, held over the weekend of Sept. 20-22 in one of two grimy lakefront warehouses on Docks 30-32, just north of FirstEnergy Stadium.\nIn comparison with ArtPrize, which covered three square miles of downtown Grand Rapids with more than 1,500 public art, gallery and storefront installations, Ingenuity’s art component consisted of a large and gloomy, sky-lighted warehouse scattered thinly with poorly installed B-grade art. The event felt small-bore, confused, unfocused, dingy and depressing in comparison to ArtPrize.\nThe art zone at Ingenuity Fest in Cleveland.\nIngenuity, which includes a strong component of musical events and performances, drew 40,000 visitors this year and generates approximately $4.5 million in economic impact, said the event’s executive director, Paula Grooms. But it hasn’t caught fire like the event in Grand Rapids.\nPut another way, ArtPrize is like 10 versions of Parade the Circle, the annual community celebration organized by the Cleveland Museum of Art in University Circle.\nThe sudden success of ArtPrize, which stunned the city five years ago, stems from one very simple principle: It’s an example of decentralized, crowd-sourced planning that exploits the power of the internet to connect venues across the city with artists.\nDreamed up by Rick DeVos, a venture capitalist and a grandson of Amway founder Richard DeVos, ArtPrize works very simply.\nArtists and venues pay nominal entry fees and register on the ArtPrize website, where they match up with each other to negotiate the size, location and type of art that will be installed.\nArtists must be 18 years old, and venues can be any business, institution or public location within the prescribed three-square-mile zone in and around downtown.\nVisitors peruse the ArtPrize entry, \"Merdian,\" an adhesive-backed vinyl installation by Lauren Cotton.\nFor public locations, artists can partner with the city. They can even use the Grand River, if they get permission from the city and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nFor example, California artists Al and Laurie Roberts installed \"Silkwaves in the Grand,\" a series of tall banners that visually activated a stretch of the Grand River.\nIn 2009, Rick DeVos, who was 26 at the time, dreamed up the idea as a way to animate a downtown that had been physically renewed over the previous four decades with a new convention center, hotels and a “medical mile” of health and academic institutions, plus a new art museum building and handsome streetscapes. Grand Rapids looked great, but it had no soul, no street life.\nApart from exploiting the Internet, his big innovations with ArtPrize were to use large cash prizes to get the attention of artists and venues, and to allow the public at large to vote on the winners.\nDeVos said he and his family invested more than $1 million in the first year of the festival, but spent virtually nothing on marketing.\n“We could take everything that would have been spent on an advertising and marketing budget and put it into a prize and put the word out there,” he said.\nDeVos and the small ArtPrize startup crew were shocked by the result. So was Grand Rapids. Part of the legend of the event is that so many people mobbed the downtown during the first Art Prize that restaurants literally ran out of food to serve.\nDeVos expected perhaps 120 to 150 artists and 15 or 20 venues to enter in the first year.\nA 2011 economic impact study prepared by Anderson Economic Group LLC stated that ArtPrize hosted 1,582 artists from 36 countries and 42 states in its third year. They competed for $484,000 in prizes, with a top prize of $250,000 awarded by popular vote.\nArtPrize patrons gaze at \"Sessilanoid,\" a sculpture by James Peterson installed temporarily at the Grand Rapids Art Museum. By touching a button in the piece, viewers could change its colors.\nIn that year, ArtPrize generated more than 213,000 attendees who visited an average of 1.5 times, for a total of more than 322,000 attendee days. Of those surveyed, 73 percent came from outside Grand Rapids, and 31 percent came from outside Kent and Ottawa counties.\nThe study estimated that ArtPrize generated $10.1 million in spending by visitors, plus an additional $1.9 million in spending on event operations.\nApart from money, the real value of ArtPrize is that it attracts hundreds of thousands of people to the city’s downtown and makes the streets come alive not just for a weekend, but for 19 days.\nIt also helps the downtown Grand Rapids is clean and fairly compact, with a regular grid of short streets that makes walking relatively enjoyable in comparison to Cleveland’s long, east-west blocks.\nThe Grand Rapids skyline doesn’t feature any especially notable buildings, but the overall feel of the city and its streetscapes is comfortable and welcoming.\nThis year, 168 venues participated and 1,584 artists competed for $560,000 in prizes including $200,000 for the public award and $100,000 awarded by a jury of nationally respected art leaders – a component added to Art Prize to attract a higher caliber of entrant.\nThe jurors for that top professional prize were installation artist Mel Chin, Anne Pasternak, director of Creative Time, and Manon Slome, co-founder of No Longer Empty.\nThe two organizations, both located in New York, organize public art installations and events in unusual places.\nAmong other things, ArtPrize shows off Grand Rapids' Grand River, which lives up to its name.\nArtPrize, a non-profit organization, operates on a $3.5 million budget with a full-time staff of 12. It earns 30 percent of its annual expenses, and gathers the rest through corporate sponsorships and foundation grants.\nTo be sure, the event is artistically mixed. That’s to be expected, given the open, bottom-up nature of the collaborations among artists and venues.\nSome work, perhaps even a great deal, is awful or just plain weak. Much as I enjoyed looking at the pretty banners in the river for a few minutes, I couldn't help but think: used car lot.\nIn this regard, it's significant that the winner of this year's $200,000 Public Vote Prize was Ann Loveless of Frankfort, Mich., whose winning work was a series of four quilts depicting a panorama of Sleeping Bear Dunes.\nIn the four hours over two days I spent traversing the ArtPrize landscape, I didn't see the quilt. Nor did I see the winner of the juried prize, a work by Portuguese-born Barcelona artist Carlos Bunga, who created an installation called \"Ecosystem\" at an exhibit space known as SiteLab @54, which reimagines a natural history exhibit at the Grand Rapids Public Museum.\nEven so, it's obvious from online images of the Loveless quilt that $200,000 is an incredibly lavish amount of money for something that looks utterly quotidian in concept.\nis raising the level of quality, as is the more recent introduction of the professionally juried award. Many of the works I viewed at the museum were, no surprise, museum quality.\nOn the whole, I think it's ingenious that ArtPrize spans the high and the low, the good and the bad. Given the rising attendance at the festival, the audience appears to appreciate the opportunity to explore and compare while traversing the",
        "baseline": " city.\nIn theory, if the competition can be made stiffer over time, ArtPrize will become more significant in the global art world and the art market, and even more valuable economically to the city.\nJeffrey Kaczmarczyk, who covers arts and entertainment for the MLive Media Group and the Grand Rapids Press, argues that the $560,000 in awards should be split evenly between the juried and popular awards. That's one possible way forward. Others should also be explored.\nWhat's clear now is that ArtPrize is a very valuable commodity for Grand Rapids. If nothing else, it has tapped an enormous well of civic affection for Grand Rapids. That's an emotion to be treasured, nurtured and developed.\nCleveland, and many other cities across the country, could benefit from the spirit generated by ArtPrize – if only they could find a way to do so without literally imitating Grand Rapids' highly successful cultural foray.",

        "prompt": "After celebrating House approval of a GOP health care bill with a pep rally in the White House Rose Garden on May 4, political fallout from the firing of the FBI Director and the investigation into Russia's election meddling have pushed President Donald Trump's focus away from his domestic agenda, as he leaves for his first overseas trip on Friday.\nFollowing an active first 100 days in office, which sometimes saw him do three or four public events in a day, the President's White House schedule slowed noticeably over the last two weeks, as he did little to promote GOP efforts in Congress to revamp the Obama health law and press for other items on his legislative agenda.\n\"Obamacare is collapsing, it's dead, it's gone,\" the President said at the White House on Thursday, making a very short mention of health care, two weeks after the House had approved a GOP health care plan.\nInstead of trying to capitalize on that bit of good news, and create more momentum for Republicans in Congress, the President spent the last two weeks mainly doing battle over the FBI Director and the probe into Russia's election year interference.\nOn Capitol Hill, there was concern among some GOP lawmakers this week that the focus needs to be shifted back to the Trump Agenda, no matter what's going on with Russia at the White House.\n\"It does sort of take away from the urgency of things that we have to get done,\" said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL). \"And that's unfortunate.\"\n\"There's a continual fodder for raising the issues,\" Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) said of questions about the Russia investigation.\n\"It's a distraction from the main agenda,\" he added.\n\"I know that people can get consumed with the news of the day,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, \"but we are here working on people's problems every day.\"\nOther Republicans echoed the Speaker in arguing that the GOP can walk - and chew gum - at the same time, and work on their agenda, no matter what the President is dealing with.\n\"I'm not worried about it slowing down unless Republicans give in to the media pressure that there is a problem,\" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA).\n1) Health care. While the House has already approved a bill to overhaul the Obama health law, it's not clear when the Senate will put together its own plan, and bring that to the floor for debate and votes. GOP Senators are meeting regularly on the issue, but don't seem to be near a deal. Next week, the Congressional Budget Office score comes out on the House-passed bill.\n2) Tax reform. Even though the President and GOP leaders in Congress agree on the need to act on tax cuts and tax reform, no bill has yet been formulated. And because of the special 'reconciliation' process being used to avoid a Senate filibuster, work on that must wait until action is fully completed on health care. Speaker Ryan wants it done this year - that will be difficult.\n3) Budget resolution. Along with health care, Republicans must approve a budget blueprint for 2018 that authorizes another reconciliation bill, which the GOP plans to use for tax reform.",
        "baseline": " That plan is supposed to be done by April 15 - but over a month later, it remains on hold. President Trump will submit his budget details to Congress next week.\n4) Spending bills. A year ago at this time, House Republicans were already busy on the dozen spending bills for the 2017 budget year. It didn't matter, as the process bogged down yet again, and seems likely to be behind schedule again this year. Remember, the Congress hasn't approved those yearly appropriations bills on time (by September 30) since 1996.\n\"We’ve made tremendous progress in the last 100-some-odd days,\" the President said on Thursday at the White House. \"I'm very proud of it. That's what I want to be focused on.\"\nThe last two weeks though, have not been from that playbook.\nThe President will have a chance to change that, and re-focus on his domestic agenda, when he gets back from his nine day trip.",

    {
        "prompt": "It’s well known that we Americans are dissatisfied with our politicians in Washington. We have been for a long time. And since Congress is inhabited by just two political parties, that dissatisfaction is with the Democrats and Republicans (just two members of Congress are Independents, Senators King and Sanders).\nHere’s how that dissatisfaction looks by the numbers. Currently, only 29% of adults identify as Republicans, and 28% as Democrats, while 40% identify as Independents. As of the first week of May 2017, according to an ongoing Gallup poll, just 20% of Americans approved of how Congress is doing its job. And although it has been lower during the period, the approval rating has not been above 30% since August 2009 (the 111th Congress, under Democratic control), and not above 40% since February 2005 (the 109th Congress, under Republican control).\nFinally, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll conducted between April 17 and 20th, 2017 found that 62% of respondents viewed the Republican Party as being “out of touch with people’s concerns.” While 67% held that view about the Democratic Party.\nAlthough the Parties are not the government, so much of what we know about government is filtered through the Parties. Through the President, and the Senate and House Majority and Minority Leaders, who are never introduced to us without their Party affiliation. When they speak to us publicly, they seem to speak first as members of their Party and only second a government representative. Since the laws and policies Congress puts in place bear no relationship to what the people by large majorities want them to do, they do not speak to our issues, they speak representing their Party’s and their donors’ view of government. When they do speak to our issues, they are either lying or paying lip service.\nAside from the relatively infrequent direct contact between a constituent and his/her Senator or Representative, the public’s access to government is typically through Party speak heard via news media. The real disconnect between the people and their government, confirmed by the above numbers, cries out for an explanation and a solution. Congress people rarely acknowledge this issue, let alone address it, despite its great significance for our democracy. What follows is an attempt to explain the disconnect and why it continues. The proposed solution is dealt with below.\nThere is a psychological phenomenon known as learned helplessness. It comes about when one is chronically subjected to a noxious situation that one is unable to resolve or escape from. The person learns to be helpless in that and similar situations and gives up trying to resist.\nFor many of us in this country, the economic and political situation has been extremely aversive to our person, our quality of life, our families, our future and the future of our kids. And try as we may, election after election, to change things for the better the situation remains the same or becomes worse. We have no apparent way to fix it and we cannot escape it. These are the perfect conditions in which to learn helplessness. Perhaps that is what accounts for the 47% who did not vote in the 2016 election. They simply gave up after learning they were helpless to make things better for themselves or others.\nFor the last 40 years, through three Democratic Administrations and three Republican Administrations, the vast majority of Americans have seen their earning power, wealth, standard of living, social mobility and future prospects for their children steadily decline. They have watched our once proud, vibrant and economically ascendant nation lose status and respect around the world. And they have observed as the great achievements of their labor: the interstate highway system, bridges, dams, tunnels, airports, national parks and water systems, have fallen into disrepair due to government neglect. For a people who love their country, watching it decline and take us with it is a highly aversive constellation of events. As patriots unable to come to the aid of the nation and each other is personally painful.\nAt the same time, as more and more of us are coming to realize, a small minority of our population has seen their fortunes move in the exact opposite direction, almost as though everything we have lost has found its way into the bank accounts and stock portfolios of the group we know as the 1 percent. Coincidental? Not hardly. Since the 1970’s, the corporate elite have been on a mission of their own to “take back the government” from you and I, having suffered major setbacks from the 1930’s through the Nixon years because of the many progressive reforms of the period. Curiously, those reforms took place during both Republican and Democratic Administrations alike. Superseding partisanship throughout that time was the attitude that government existed to serve the people. An attitude reborn in the Great Depression and brought to fulfillment through the sustained mass movements of a conscious and organized populace.\nOnce the business community went on the offensive in the 1970’s, corporations and business organizations moved their lobbying efforts from the financial capitol, New York City, to the political capitol of the nation. Washington, DC. Pragmatic to a fault, they operated as equal opportunity corrupters, buying political influence from Democrats and Republicans alike. The notion that government was there to serve the people had become quaint. The 1 percent had remarkable success in rolling back pesky profit inhibiting regulations and passing corporate-friendly legislation. But in the 1990’s they really hit the jackpot when Bill Clinton formally ended the Democrat’s alliance with America’s working people by throwing in totally with the donor class. Since that time both parties have been full subsidiaries of the financial/corporate cabal that is the unelected de facto government of the US.\nThe question must be asked. How did we let this happen? It did not slip by unnoticed. We have long realized that government has not been working for us. We are not a country of dummies. We have the brains, logic and rationality to solve all kinds of tough problems. Americans do that every day.\nWe were bested by an internal enemy. One that worked within the system, using (mostly) legal means to distort our economy and chip away at our democracy. The very democratic institutions that our nation and citizens rely upon were used by the financiers, corporations and other wealthy sectors to seize control. The freedoms that democratic government provides were abused to achieve that control. The Founders warned of this danger of representative democracy even as they established it. They told us that we must be vigilant for just the sort of usurpation that has occurred. We were insufficiently vigilant and crushingly passive in the face of the takeover.\nHere we have the consequence of our learned helplessness. The all-powerful corporate control of government that permits no concessions to the will of the people. And allows us no sanctioned avenue of redress. Our own country has trapped us in awful conditions which we can neither readily fix nor escape.\nSuch helplessness is typically experienced on an individual level. At that level, it is easy to conclude that we are powerless to affect change. Recognizing that others feel helpless as well is a first step toward a group or class consciousness that facilitates hope, cooperation and joint problem solving. Once we join with others in our same situation new possibilities open and helplessness begins to fade. Organized social action is a great antidote for helplessness and hopelessness. And it is the ONLY thing that solves large societal problems.\nAs citizens, we are told that if we are unhappy with our government we can remedy the situation through the election process. If that were ever true, it is no longer so today and has not been so through the decades of decline. When we wondered out loud about it we were always answered with one form or another of “it’s the other party’s fault.” When the Dems are out of power, it’s the Repubs’ fault. When the Repubs are out of power, it’s the Dems’ fault. I don’t know how many buy that “explanation”, but by way of explaining 40 years of government consistently and utterly failing to protect the welfare of all but a handful of Americans, it is clearly ludicrous.\nI am sure that you can see where I am going with this. The Dems and Repubs are working together to neutralize our opposition to the crimes being committed against us by their boss, the 1 percent. Obviously, the Repubs are the Bad Cop. They are NOT acting. Their proposed and accomplished assaults on our standard of living, freedoms and rights are dead serious. The Dems are the actors. They pretend to be our friend, to truly represent us against those dastardly GOPers. They lie to us by still referring to themselves as the party of working people. They ask us to trust them, give them our votes. Like the Good Cops, their aim, however, is to disarm us, to have us believe we can safely put our future in their hands. They will take care of it. The specific message is that we do not need to protest or demonstrate, or to take matters into our own hands. Playing us off the Repubs, but in league with them, they seek to keep us docile, to have us hand them our power, to neutralize us.\nThe sum up is this. Consciousness is key. We must understand that there are millions of us in this same",
        "baseline": " boat. That our individual sense of helplessness, if we have it, is real. We cannot fight the 1 percent on our own. But together we can accomplish anything. We have allies all around us, but allow artificial barriers to prevent us from seeking them out. Those barriers are: race, religion, sexual preference, education, age, employment status, nationality and more. Only one thing matters. We are ALL victims of the 1 percent and their lackeys. Our seemingly individual struggles all trace back to one source, the unelected, illegitimate ruling class. Once we understand this, solidarity with our brothers and sisters in struggle will be a natural outcome.\nConsciousness will also prevent us from falling for the Good Cop, Bad Cop routine of the Parties. Neither is our friend. As we organize against the ruling class, we will need to build our own independent party as well. It will need to be a major political party alongside the others to consolidate the gains won by our movement.",

The Stark Law prohibits a hospital from billing Medicare for services referred by doctors with whom the hospital has an improper financial arrangement, such as excessive compensation.\nThe allegations predate Beaumont's 2014 three-way merger with what was Dearborn-based Oakwood Healthcare and Farmington Hills' Botsford Hospital. It also occurred under a different Beaumont executive team.\n“Offering financial incentives to physicians in return for patient referrals undermines the integrity of our health care system,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler of the Justice Department’s Civil Division said in a statement.\nThe allegations were first brought forth in four separate whistle-blower lawsuits filed in 2010 and 2011 under provisions in the False Claims Act that allow whistle-blowers to share a portion of any recovery.\nThe lawsuits — unsealed Thursday for the first time — include detailed allegations and name numerous Beaumont doctors and administrators.\nHow much money the whistle-blowers will get has yet to be determined, the Justice Department said.\nThe settlement also resolves claims that Beaumont allegedly misrepresented that a CT radiology center qualified as an outpatient department of Beaumont in claims to federal health care programs. That distinction could have affected the amount of Beaumont’s reimbursement.\nOne of the newly unsealed lawsuits alleged that \"Beaumont has engaged in a consistent practice of rewarding top referral sources with medical directorships and other 'perk' appointments where they are required to perform little if any work in return for sizable salaries.\"\nIn another unsealed lawsuit, a whistle-blowing doctor claimed he was marginalized by top hospital administrators after sharing his belief that some doctors were essentially receiving kickbacks, among other concerns.\nThat whistle-blower's lawsuit also claims a former Beaumont comptroller was laid off in part for his attempts to correct some of the improper practices going on.\nBeaumont Health president and CEO John Fox said in a statement that since the 2014 merger, the hospital system has implemented additional procedures and legal reviews to ensure \"that these types of issues do not arise again.\"\n\"As part of our settlement with the DOJ, we will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with representatives of the Department of Health and Human Services for five years,\" said Fox, who did not work at Beaumont when the alleged behavior occurred.\nThe allegedly overpaid doctors included four cardiologists with 2009 salaries between $702,000 and $753,000, which a whistle-blower considered to be well above the typical cardiologist's salary at the time. In addition to the big salaries, those doctors were allowed to keep revenue from their private practices, even though that work cut into their time for Beaumont.\n\"These enormous salaries are provided to the cardiologists as a pure kickback for conducting their practice at Beaumont,\" the whistle-blower's lawsuit said. \"This illegal arrangement is openly discussed at Beaumont.\"\nThe lawsuit also claims that a group of oncologists threatened to walk out of Beaumont and set up their own oncology practice if they didn't also get a \"special deal,\" presumably one like the cardiologists.\nAfter an agreement was struck that raised the oncologists' earning potential, one of the most productive research oncologists resigned, \"in large part because he did not want to be party to what he considered an illegal kickback scheme,\" the lawsuit said.\nAnother of the unsealed whistle-blower lawsuits claimed that Beaumont grossly overpaid one surgeon with an $800,000 salary who it knew was committing billing fraud.\nThis surgeon routinely performed a surgical weight-loss procedure that wasn't covered by private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, yet he would bill it as a “partial gastrectomy and hiatal hernia repair” that was covered by insurance.\nThat lawsuit also claimed that Beaumont, despite having its own MRI machines, leased",
        "baseline": " MRI facilities from a physicians' group as a financial incentive for the group to refer more patients to Beaumont.\nThat lawsuit's whistle-blower says she informed a top Beaumont executive that the Beaumont Urology Center had been operating for two years without a state-required Certificate of Need. But she was told that shutting down the urology center would affect Beaumont's patient referrals.\nUnder the U.S. Justice Department settlement, Beaumont Health paid $82.74 million to the U.S. and $1.76 million to the State of Michigan.\n\"I would like to commend the new leadership at Beaumont Hospital for making things right once its past wrongdoing was brought to its attention by federal investigators,\" said U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider for the Eastern District of Michigan.\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story misstated the first name of U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider.

        "prompt": "TIJUANA, Mexico — After more than a month on the move, a caravan of migrants from Central America has come to a halt just a few yards from the border wall that divides Mexico and the United States.\nThe metal barrier looms near the sports center where Tijuana’s city government has set up a shelter for the migrants, whose numbers are swelling as buses arrive almost daily. On the other side — beyond floodlights, motion sensors, cameras and a second fence — lies their goal: the United States.\nBut it is dawning on many of them that the shelter could be their home for months if they decide to seek legal entry into the United States.\n“We have to wait — for how long?” asked Lenin Herrera Batres, 20, who joined the caravan with his wife and their 2-year-old son to escape threats after the couple witnessed a murder in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula.\n“We don’t have the money to stay here for one month, two months,” he said, his voice trailing off.\nLess than a week old, the shelter has assumed the squalor of an overwhelmed refugee camp, and the rhythms of enforced idleness have taken hold. One group spends hours watching karaoke singers at an end of the basketball courts there, while men bet on cards at the other. Children dart around a playground. Women fold donated blankets in the reflexive gestures of tidying up at home, now just a tiny patch under a large tent.\nCity officials, who fear that as many as 10,000 migrants from this caravan and two more behind it may ultimately alight in Tijuana in the coming weeks, are scrambling to provide for them.\nThe number of migrants at the shelter swelled to almost 2,500 this weekend, with room for only 1,000 more.\nBut an estimated 3,400 are waiting in Mexicali, a border city two and half hours to the east, and most of those are expected to reach Tijuana on Monday, said Maggie Núñez, who was working with Pueblo sin Fronteras, an advocacy group that is assisting the caravan.\nTijuana’s mayor, Juan Manuel Gastélum, has estimated that if all of the Central American migrants traveling north come to the city and seek asylum in the United States, it could take six months for their claims to be heard at the main port of entry to San Diego.\nThey must take their turn behind about 3,000 others — from Mexico, nations across Central and South America, and even West Africa — who are waiting for an interview with a United States asylum officer. The delay may last as long as two months.\nNew rules issued by the Trump administration this month are designed to funnel asylum seekers to an official port of entry rather than allowing them to present themselves to the Border Patrol if they make it across the border illegally.\nAs the bottleneck in Tijuana has grown, it has threatened to try the patience of a city that is itself the creation of migrants and typically provides for them through church-run shelters.\nSome Mexicans ask why Central Americans are receiving special treatment, when the government offers no help for Mexicans fleeing violence in other states or for those deported from the United States.\n“There are so many undocumented people who do not have Mexico’s help,” said Rosa Guadalupe Martínez, 61, an optometric technician, who on Sunday joined a protest march of several dozen people waving Mexican flags. Others were openly hostile, alleging that some of the Central Americans would turn to crime.\nIt is impossible to square the listless mood of the shelter with what President Trump railed against as a caravan “invasion” before this month’s midterm elections.\nBy banding together, the migrants sought protection against the criminal gangs and corrupt officials who prey on people trying to reach the United States border. But they had little sense of the political firestorm their trek had set off.\nMany of the migrants repeat the magical thinking that has sustained them through their journey and brought them right up to the edge of the border: a belief that once all of the caravan has reached Tijuana, the gates may by flung open.\nOthers have begun to deal in practicalities, walking a mile from the shelter to enter their names on a waiting list for an asylum interview. Some clustered around volunteer American lawyers who arrived at the shelter to explain the basics of asylum law.\n“People don’t flee their country and go through the arduous trip on foot unless the situation is desperate,” said Gilbert Saucedo, a Los Angeles lawyer who helped organize the volunteers through the National Lawyers Guild.\n“I have talked to maybe 100 people today,” he said on Saturday, “and maybe 70 percent had credible cases on the surface.” Yet many lack the documents they need to provide evidence.\nThe migrants often reveal little emotion when recounting the violence they have fled, as if admitting grief could lead to a despair that would paralyze them at the very moment they need to keep pressing ahead.\n“They killed my whole family, my father, my mother and my two brothers,” said Jose Miguel Martínez, a rail-thin 18-year-old from El Salvador. He said he had been spared because he was in the military at the time — but never received a police report or death certificate.\nOrbelina Meléndez, 36, watched as her husband was shot in front of her in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and then received death threats. She has no police report. �",
        "baseline": "�When you are poor, they do not investigate and it remains unpunished,” she said.\nMelissa Guzmán, 33, from Honduras, was one of those who turned up early Saturday to put her name on the interview waiting list.

        "prompt": "Even principled conservatives (yes, there are some, unlike principled liberals, a species near extinction) are beginning to shudder at Obama’s war-intensity and expansion of Executive power. George Will, not my favorite, had cogent things to say about Obama’s maneuvering into war with ISIS. His Washington Post article, “Obama is defying the Constitution on war,” (Sept. 17), states the US last declared war in 1942 (on Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria) as part of WWII, and continues: “Today’s issue is not whether to declare war but only whether the president should even seek congressional authorization for the protracted use of force against the Islamic State.” Implication: the declaration, which can be skipped, is a self-evident power of the president, thereby making congressional authorization a mere formality, if sought at all.\nOur Con Law POTUS, even more than his predecessors (Bush at least had John Yoo to lie for him, with spurious Office of Legal Counsel rationales), rapes the fundamental law of the land. This is not surprising, given his denial of habeas corpus rights to detainees, and now, drastically enlarged the violation of civil liberties through his massive surveillance of the American people. Current NSA policy and John Brennan’s promotion of torture are fit companions to his thinking and policies on behalf of the American people. From this overall context of despisement for the law, shared, but not carried to such lengths, by his predecessors, we have his high-tech fascination with getting away with murder (literally), as in drone assassination.\nThat is what I mean by sterilized armed conflict, put on already in airstrikes against ISIS: clean, polished, sophisticated, obliterative, Attila the Hun as Peace Nobelist. Here I credit George Will with insight and conscience, both seriously deficient in Washington, even though he tends to think in terms of formalities; not the act of war, but its proper constitutional authorization, most drives his criticism. In today’s sorry political culture, we should be thankful even for crumbs.\n“Promising to ‘destroy’ this group with the help of ‘a broad coalition’ of ‘partners,’” he writes, “President Obama said last week, ‘I welcome congressional support for this effort.’ He obviously thinks such support is optional, partly because this ‘effort,’ conducted by U.S. combat aircraft, is something other than war. There he goes again.” Exactly, there he goes again, the ISIS business merely the last (thus far) in a whole string of violations, using, as in Libya, airstrikes to circumvent the clear meaning and understanding of international law.\nObama claims that as commander-in-chief he has inherent powers to authorize bombing ISIS in Syria, and goes further, citing the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against ISIS, when, again Will, AUMF was specific to al-Qaeda, whereas ISIS “did not exist in 2001 and was born in hostility to the perpetrator of the 2001 attacks, al-Qaeda.” But that’s what White House lawyers are for. Hence, using AUMF is unjustified for advancing a protracted war, whether air strikes or ground forces, nicely put in this context by Goldsmith as “’presidential unilateralism masquerading as implausible statutory interpretation.” My translation: Obama, international outlaw.\nSignificantly, no White House Legal Counsel opinion has yet been forthcoming on airstrikes against ISIS. Bring back John Yoo from Berkeley, which is only fitting as Obama plays piggy-back jumping over Bush. Finally here, Will quotes Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law, who “says that nothing Bush attempted ‘remotely compares in IMPERIAL HUBRIS’ [my caps.] with Obama’s ‘assertion of unilateral war-making authority.’” For Will—the conservative– to be so critical, imagine what a radical might say: fascism, in process or already present.\nMomentum for war is building. Things are marvelously heating up, the compression of events, plainly orchestrated by the White House, Dempsey and Hagel before Senate Armed Services Tuesday, Obama at MacDill Air Force Wednesday, the House vote, same day, Kerry soon at the UN, a veritable bandwagon of support, “friends and allies,” between 30-40, standing in the wings, all that is missing…armed forces on the ground. I’ve already discussed Dempsey in a CP article. Let’s jump into midweek events with the House approval of arming the Free Syrian Army. Senate is expected today, 9/18, to follow, but with one corrective. Obama, with full bipartisan cooperation in the House, had the debate and vote associated with the stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government, though in separate votes, while in the Senate, the two measures are connected.\nThere is nothing like the patriotic glory of war to bring the parties together. After Obama “personally pleaded for support,” the House voted 273-156 “to authorize the training and arming of Syrian rebels to confront” ISIS. This is a comfortable margin in light of party battles, logjam, stalemate on a wide range of issues, none of which has a bearing on war, intervention, assassination, full-spectrum adherence to imperialism and militarism. Consensus reflects what really matters to the nation. Peace and social justice are NOT part of the mix, except that in their case neither party has a positive record on these and related issues (corporate regulation, strict environmental controls, vital social safety net), thus if you will a negative consensus dedicated to monopoly capital, which helps to fuel the positive consensus on war.\nTimes reporter Jonathan Weisman’s article, “House Votes to Authorize Aid to Syrian Rebels in ISIS Fight,” (Sept. 17), an accurate mouthful, states that the measure “took on outsize importance and was infused with drama, reflecting the tension and ambiguity of members wary of the ultimate path to which any war vote could lead.” It seems no-one believed Obama’s protestations about no boots on the ground. War is fully expected on (that detestable phrase) “both sides of the aisle,” and by supporters and critics alike. The latter included negative votes, supporters who didn’t think Obama went far enough, and opponents fearful of the war consequences but not very forceful in their opposition. If ISIS could be eliminated with one nuclear blast, there would be few teary eyes in Washington, except for concern its absence would remove a prop for counterterrorism, surveillance, assassination, military appropriations, the operative doctrine of permanent war.\nWhatever happens, ISIS don’t self-destruct. The US needs your threat-presence to validate its global leadership, until—as in the song—the next one comes along. Or, is manufactured. Meanwhile, Obama at MacDill, the staged background of servicemembers: “’The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq.’” What Weisman called “theater” in preparation for the debate and vote, Obama, Biden, others manning the phones calling for support (Do not undercut the president in wartime), somewhat weakens the sincerity and strength of the promise.\nAh, the Voices for Freedom. Here is Ruppersberger, ranking Democrat on House Intelligence: “’Obama is our commander in chief. You don’t weaken the commander in chief when we’re in a serious crisis.’” And McCarthy, Republican and majority leader: “’I know that many of us in the chamber, from both sides of the aisle, believe the president’s strategy should do more to eradicate these extremists from the earth. But despite these reservations—reservations that I share—we must support this amendment and take this first step.’” Another Republican: “’What would our allies think if we rejected the president’s request?’” With statements like this from both sides of the aisle, opposition to ground forces and all-out war would be paper-thin, easily overcome by the patriotic hysteria worked up by government and the media, and the predisposition, already found, of a nation losing ground as the once supreme arbiter of world politics and military affairs.\nThen on the same day, we see Obama at MacDill Air Force Base, the occasion, along with the House vote and the previous day’s Dempsey-Hagel testimony, a perfect demonstration of wartime symbolism. He addresses the troops, providing assurances of no ground war to the public, and meets with leaders of his military command, but also brings along his national-security advisers (including Hagel), so that we have a consummation of the marriage of the Military and the Executive. Obama appears increasingly needful of the military glorification of his own person.\nAccording to a NYT/CBS poll Shear includes in his article, showing only one-third of the public approving Obama’s conduct of foreign policy, the negative rating concerns lack of stronger military action taken against ISIS, in other words, open sesame for the reversal of policy just announced.\nA further straw in the wind (more like the whole haystack flying about) is the position taken by General Ray Odierno, a bellwether of military planning, presently Army chief of staff, who spoke to The Times and other news organizations on the 18th, one day after Dempsey, in Wiesbaden. Times reporter Alison Smale was present. In her article, “U.S. Army Chief Says Ground Troops Will Be Needed Against ISIS,” one senses a palace revolt of sorts, the military chafing at the bit, while, as with Dempsey’s testimony hinting at ground forces in Iraq, the White House is quick to deny insubordination on both their parts. I take this as illustration, instead, of movement in the intended direction, ISIS’s utter destruction, which Obama signaled in his earlier speech. Neither Dempsey nor Odierno expressed confidence in air power or in the mobilization of an international coalition, leaving therefore a big fat question mark concerning the use of American ground forces.\nFree Syrian Army–who thought up that name? Public relations by the Obama administration in the rush to ANOTHER war. The authoritarian mindset: You must support your Commander-in-Chief, for what would the world otherwise think? What would happen to American global leadership? Congress in lockstep. Threat to the Homeland. Forward march.\nAmerica hungers for war–polls criticize Obama for not going far enough. Air power is the magical nostrum, a sanitization of death that, because at a distance, weighs on no-one’s conscience. Curtis LeMay is a choir boy",
        "baseline": " compared with present advocates of warfare. Bomb, bomb our way to Virtue.\nObama promises no ground forces–unless of course circumstances change (circumstances we define to suit our pre-planned policies). Like drone assassination, military policy/action falls on deaf ears, America enclosed in a wall of deniability.\nThe Middle East is merely one of many war fronts. One that focuses attention, and detracts from critical awareness of the wider geopolitical framework. Global hegemony is not a slogan but a fact, or rather, aspiration, the RENEWAL of supremacy in the world system as the global order itself, despite US wishes and efforts, is becoming multi-polar.\nObama sends his proxies, Dempsey, Hagel, Kerry into the fray, just as America enlists its proxies, the international coalition, to do battle. For what? We are never told, but must take POTUS on faith–an unwise thing to do. War Nobelist to the rescue.",

The fate of Barwell and thousands of residents rests in the hands of just 16 people who can change the future of the village forever.\nEvery single vote by members of Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council’s planning committee will have a momentous effect on whether the controversial Barwell Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) becomes a reality or not.\nThe plans for 2,500 homes, as well as a new school, sports pitches and an employment zone, will finally be debated at a special meeting on Tuesday night at Argents Mead where nine Liberal Democrat and seven Conservative councillors will cast the deciding votes.\nSo what exactly will be built on swathes of land between Barwell and Stapleton should the developers - a consortium of Ainscough Strategic Land, Barwood Development Securities and Taylor Wimpey - be granted planning permission?\nThe bulk of the 132-hectare site will be taken up by 2,500 homes to the east of Ashby Road and north and south of Stapleton Lane, which will include a mix of housing types and sizes, including provision of affordable housing.\nA community hub at the west of the £250 million development would include a new primary school, shops and the potential for a family pub/restaurant or Primary Care Trust health centre, while new play areas, open spaces, allotments, football and cricket pitches and a bowling green would also be built.\nThe consortium claim that more than 1,000 jobs will be created through the industrial area at the south of the site, extra jobs needed at existing businesses in the area and more than 200 full-time jobs in construction and apprenticeship opportunities.\nDespite all the claims of benefits for Barwell and the surrounding area, many are not happy with the plans and a protest is expected outside the council offices in the lead up to Tuesday night’s meeting.\nCampaigner Huw Williams said: “The professional politicians at the borough council who seem hell bent on ignoring us, the little people in Barwell, to press on with their grand plans need to be shown that we will not be ignored.\nThe developers have stood by their plans from day one which they also say would see £4.3 million for creating new places at existing schools, £15.9 million from the Government’s new homes bonus for the borough council, of which £3.9 million would go to Barwell Parish Council, £25 million in new spending power in the local economy by new residents and a Barwell Centre Improvement Fund to help regenerating the village centre with the likes of new car parks and the potential redevelopment of the Co-op store.\nAccess to the SUE would be via four new routes: two from Stapleton Lane and two from Ashby",

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to breathe new life into Barwell and should be seized with both hands.\n“We were particularly pleased to see that the officers’ report is so positive on our ideas for design and place making.

They go on sale this Friday, but I'm wearing a pair right now, suckas.\n1. They are dunks, but they will not help you dunk.\n2. They say Belfast on them, but they were not made in Belfast.\n3. If you can run 88 mph you will not go back in time, but you'll still be running 88 mph. Which is pretty cool.\n4. There's no secret pocket for transporting cocaine.\nClearly, the shoes are meant as nostalgia for the car itself and not the Back To The Future films (those shoes do exist), which suits me just fine.\nMars Blackmon explains why I can't dunk.\nDespite not letting you travel through time or dunk like Russell Westbrook, the shoes are wonderful. Designed to mimic the stainless steel finish of a DMC-12, the \"no-sew\" material offers a matte finish unlike anything I've seen on a shoe before. It's understated but fantastic.\nOut back, the embossed DMC stamp sits above a louvered pattern also inspired by the car cars rear windows. The bottom of the shoe is pure fantasy, with the red-white-and-yellow taillight pattern preserved on the outer sole. Not sure why they didn't grid it off, but it's another example of giving a shout out to the car while still retaining its own unique identity as footwear.\nLike the even more limited-",

My favorite part is the Belfast stamp on the tongue, a sly reference to the car's being constructed in Ireland and perhaps the only shoe in a long line of shoes named after geographic locations (Mexico 66's, for example) to be named for the Irish town.\nIt's almost a shame to wear them as the material slightly deforms when you do — the only drawback to the look. Also, if I hadn't unboxed them I could be selling my review pair on eBay right now like this guy, but my integrity is worth slightly more than $349.99.\nFull Disclosure: Nike/DMC did send me a copy, but I'm not going to sell them as that would be unethical. And keeping them locked up will only make me want to sell them in the future. So I'm going to wear them. Suckas.",

        "prompt": "Don't be surprised if you see shades of European architecture in the Peruvian city of Arequipa. Located in the country's southern end, Arequipa was established in 1540 by Spanish conquistadors, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization describes the city's architecture as a \"creative integration of European and native characteristics.\" There's far more to do in Arequipa, however, than admire its rich history -- although you may find yourself doing just that.\nNear the center of town, the Santa Catalina Monastery (santacatalina.org.pe) is a can't-miss destination if you're interested in architecture, religion or history. The monastery was founded in 1579. Many original structures have been damaged by earthquakes and rebuilt over time, while others were added in later centuries. Today the monastery is a complex of buildings, walkways and cloisters, with nuns still living on the premises. In addition to religious relics and architecture from various periods, you'll see artwork everywhere: 400 paintings by native artists were discovered when the monastery was being opened to the public, and they're on display throughout the area. As of the date of publication, admission costs about $13 American per person.\nSome of Peru's most incredible sights are a short distance outside Arequipa. Venture northeast out of the city to El Misti, a 19,000-foot volcano that is popular with climbers, although less active travelers can also appreciate its views. Hire a local guide to lead you if you're interested in climbing. Further out of town -- the drive will take at least a few hours -- is Cañón del Colca, a canyon that is 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, long. This canyon is also twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Companies like ACTours (colcatours.com) and Carlitos Tours (carlitostours.com) lead single- or multi-day tours of the area.\nIn the evenings, Arequipa comes alive as both tourists and locals enjoy the nightlife. You won't be sipping beer in bars like you'd find at home; according to Frommer's, many of Arequipa's bars have vaulted ceilings made of sillar, which is a local, white volcanic stone. Head to the old quarter and dance to live bands playing Andean music. When you're hungry, ask the locals to recommend a picantería, a nickname for an Arequipa restaurant that serves the spicy food that is typical of the region.\nYou'll see plenty of Arequipa's architectural details while walking from place to place, but seeking out the most significant buildings will give you the best look. Walk around the district of San Lazaro to look for buildings made of adobe and stone; Arequip",
        "baseline": "a's earliest buildings were made with these materials, and some survive in this district. Visit the Santo Domingo convent, which was built from the 16th to 18th centuries, and compare it to the mid-19th century Plaza de Armas. If you'd like a local guide to give you background, a few companies like Bustour (bustour.com.pe) operate tours in Arequipa. Verify that your guide speaks English before buying a ticket.\nWalsh, Kathryn. \"The Top Things to Do in Arequipa, Peru.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/top-things-arequipa-peru-105210.html.

This week, the ERC turned to the MIT student community for ideas on how MIT could best address our energy problems.\nFirst, it is vital to increase MIT’s share of research into energy-related technologies and sciences. We should be in the lead here, period.\nSecond, MIT’s campus should itself be a laboratory for clean energy and efficient building technologies. Our campus should be the model for other campuses, towns and municipalities, neighborhoods and office complexes. We must show that clean energy technology is available, affordable, and practical in the real world.\nThird, and most importantly, MIT must confront the reality that technologies alone do not solve human problems.\nConsider these facts: engineers have already developed wind energy technologies that are economically competitive with conventional electricity generation in many (windy) markets. Hybrid auto technology is easily available. Geothermal home heating is cheap ($3,000 a home), but rarely, if ever, installed for neighborhoods and is generally available only in high-end, custom houses. Existing cogeneration technology captures otherwise completely wasted heat energy but is infrequently used. Pick your efficient technology of choice — the engineering is there, but something is still missing: an understanding of the social context of technology.\nIf we are serious about addressing our energy crises — and it is appropriate to speak of these crises in the plural — it is essential that MIT engineers and scientists work alongside social scientists and humanists to understand why some technologies are adopted and others fail even if the failing technology is demonstrably better. Without this insight, MIT will be throwing money and resources at a problem that is simply unsolvable by technological means alone.\nMy field is the History of Science, Technology, and the Environment, and my research is in the History of Energy. We in this field have shown time and again that people adopt technologies for reasons other than their efficiency, technical sweetness, or even cost. Some choices are of habit, others convenience. Sometimes the choice is not even the consumer’s to make (try changing where your electricity comes from). Furthermore, once large, complex technological systems (like our petroleum infrastructure, for example) are built, they are extremely difficult to discard. Political choices, tax policies, and environmental laws also contribute to making some systems more viable than others.\nMIT has always been at the forefront of technological research. That is what we are known for and have been known for since the late nineteenth century. But the history of technology has shown that technology alone is insufficient to address the tangle of techno-social problems.\nMore than ever, we need the insight, contribution, and collaborative efforts of social psychologists; sociologists; anthropologists; historians of science, technology, energy, and the environment; management experts; policy analysts; clergy, and others with knowledge of the social world.\nPresident Hockfield, what would be truly innovative, and demonstrate MIT’s commitment to addressing the seriousness",
        "baseline": " of our current and future energy crises, would be to bring our engineers and scientists together with their colleagues in the social sciences and the humanities to think beyond the laboratory.\nNow is our collective opportunity to do something more, to develop solutions beyond the better machine. To do that will take unprecedented collaboration.\nWhat does MIT owe the world? The best engineering and science research and education on the planet? Certainly. Leadership in addressing the most pressing challenges of the 21st century? You bet. But most of all, we owe the world our respect for its complexity. We owe our appreciation that people, politics, psychology, and ethics are as much needed as new ideas and innovation. We owe the world that the daring of our solutions will consider the enormity of the problem.\nIs MIT up to the task?\nPeter A.

    {
        "prompt": "KLAIPEDA - Lithuanian parliamentarians’ 2,000 euro salary per month is at the bottom of the list of European legislator pay, but with all parliamentary allowances, benefits and salaries summed up, the entitlements skyrocket, catapulting Lithuanian legislators to a level with an average salary, on par with the very top of the best paid elected officials in the entire European Union.\n“The national census has revealed that the Lithuanian population decreased significantly, numbering less than 3 million people. Logically, it means that single-mandate electoral districts should be reshaped, to be exact expanded and taking up the Constitution-set number of electorates in each. If that happened, the existing electoral districts would shrink, as well as the current 141 MP Lithuanian Parliament: Seimas. This step would allow cutbacks in the hefty parliamentary budget and, undoubtedly, would hike Lithuanians’ trust in their legislative body. However, with the unwillingness of the parliamentarians to do anything that would impair their status quo, the constitutional amendments leading to a fewer-seat parliament is highly improbable,” Mantas Stalnionis, a commentator, says.\nMany observers of Lithuanian politics are convinced that the issue of the lavish Lithuanian parliamentary incentives that Seimas members cling to, despite public disapproval, will be another horse that many to-be populist parties and social movements will ride on successfully in the 2012 Seimas election campaign.\nWhat do most Lithuanians fume about in regards to these perks? First comes the salary, 7,000 litas (2,029 euros), plus nearly half of that, the so-called parliamentary activity allowances.\nSure, the MPs’ working hours are another red flag that drives most Lithuanians crazy. For the regular 8-hour work shift population, it is incomprehensible how it is possible for anyone in the public sector of the crisis-stricken country to be paid nearly ten times than the average salary, skip mandatory sittings and enjoy a four-and-half month vacation.\nWhen the costly heating season strains most Vilnius dwellers, who often have to give up half of their family budget just to cover the heating and communal service costs, non-Vilnius born parliamentarians and their family members are entitled to the refurbished Seimas dormitory and full coverage of communal service costs in it. Not bad, right?\nNext, but not least, is the size of severance allowances, which make up over 10,000 euros if an MP works a full parliamentary tenure and then is not re-elected, or does not seek re-election. “To be honest, I have never been aware of such benefits, even when I stayed at the wheel of the parliament. The Labor Party, whose deputy chairman I am now, stands for cutting down the excessive parliamentary benefits. However, I do not think this Seimas will have the guts to cut the fruitful branches it sits on,” Arturas Paulauskas, the former chairman of Naujoji Sajunga (New Union) and deputy chairman of the Labor Party presently, said to The Baltic Times.\nThe mid-November parliamentary deliberations over the draft on Parliamentarians’ Activity Guarantees have shown that Lithuanian legislators are far from considering any constraints on their lavish parliamentary incentives – the draft has been rejected and sent for improvements.\n“I am really surprised by the legislators’ decision. Frankly, I thought the bill, upon introduction, with certain amendments and improvements will be passed. To reject it the way the parliamentarians did, walking out before the crucial vote or abstaining during the vote, means withdrawal from solving the problem. I do not know whether the politicians who voted against the bill, or simply walked out before the vote, will seek a new Seimas tenure next year. If yes, it means they are willing to further traipse in the mud we have all been stomping in so long and tediously,” Irena Degutiene, chairwoman of the Lithuanian Parliament, said with unusually strong words to express her angst.\nShe did not say, however, that among the mud-stompers there was a bunch of her fellow Conservatives, some of whom either left the Seimas hall before the vote, or voted against the bill. “I think the bill was doomed to fail from the beginning. From my experience, the later a bill is deliberated and a vote is scheduled, the less probability there is of having it passed. Simply speaking, by the end of the day, most politicians walked out, as the rest voted in a semi-empty hall. Before taking on more serious issues, like the parliamentary benefits and allowances, Seimas has urgently to work out a mechanism ensuring attendance of Seimas sittings. I am disappointed that three of my party’s members, in protest of the bill, deliberately left the hall before the vote. They were right back after the vote was over. It is sad to realize that absence, walk-outs and voting for others, like in the case of impeached Linas Karalius, cripple the Parliament,” Pranas Zeimys, a Conservative MP, admitted to The Baltic Times.\nHe is pessimistic on having the bill on MPs’ entitlements passed in the Seimas’ spring session. “There is too big a defiance on both sides of the aisle. The benefits, unlike something else, unite the largest spectrum of politicians,” Zeimys added.\nAnother MP, chairman of the Liberal and Center Union Algis Caplikas says “some kind” of constraints on parliamentary activity compensation would make sense, but not the ones the lawyers’ working group has put for the Seimas’ vote. “I am trying to be very open-minded and flexible when it comes to the legislation. However, some provisions in the bill, like the effort to supply parliamentarians with official cars in a centralized way, make no sense to me at all. We have had a bad experience from a similar striving during the 2001-2009 Seimas tenures, when cars, German Golfs, were assigned to MPs in a centralized way. It didn’t work, but, regrettably, we are trying to jump on the same rake,” Caplikas said to The Baltic Times.\nHe calls “sheer nonsense” the bill spearheads’ effort to set a time-defined vacation for politicians. “As a parliamentarian, I work indefinite hours, which extend late into the night or weekends. The bill designers did not want to take that into consideration, raising the question of extra compensation for the after-hour work. Shamefully, they are going to decide for me when I have to go on vacation,” the parliamentarian said vexedly.\nHe says the best way to tackle the problem of poor attendance in Seimas sittings would be imposing fines for the truants. “When an MP is aware that he or she will lose 100 litas if he or she skips a sitting, the parliamentarian will start thinking whether it is worth it,” the politician said.\nHe compared the draft to a “Belarus-or-Russia-like legislative piece,” where the hard language of legislation prevails. “It is not about parliamentarians unwilling to discuss the bill; it is about the bill spearheads’ short-sightedness and rage towards the electorate’s elected officials and the desperate bid to harness them,” Caplikas inferred.\nThe revised bill is to be put to a Seimas vote again in the Parliament’s spring session. However, the outcome is quite predictable. The bill’s preparation group, compiled from prominent Lithuanian lawyers, seeks to set a fixed vacation for MPs, as well as forbid them from renting cars from parliamentary allowances on their own, instead of setting a system allowing car and office rent in a centralized way. The bill promoters intend to strictly set an amount of parliamentary allowance to be used for buying gas, representation and office leases. The bill foresees strict penalties for missing parliamentary sittings, even a month-salary cut. In addition, a 45-day vacation instead of a 4-and-half month vacation is suggested.\nSeimas Chairwoman Degutiene, nevertheless, is hopeful in bringing the revised and supplemented bill for the MPs in spring 2012. “I hope that common sense will prevail and we pass the law,” she said, pointing out that many MPs voted against it in protest of the Social Democrat and chairman of Seimas’ Ethics and Procedure Commission Algimantas Salamakinas, who has brought much MP anger and frustration over his led commission’s often dubious decisions on what parliamentary behavior is ethical, and what is not.\nHow do neighbor countries deal with the benefits (if they exist) of their chosen representatives? The data of Seimas’ Parliamentary Research Department show that most European countries do not follow a set system of benefits. For example, Estonian MPs set their activities and parliamentary work guarantees 4 years ago, while Latvians legislators set their benefits in the Saeima statute.\nUnlike in Lithuania, in the other two Baltic countries MP salaries are recalculated every year, and politicians receive parliamentary activity compensation for transport, office, representation and professional training. In that regard, Estonia has set it such that this kind of compensation cannot exceed 30 percent of the parliamentary salary, which is 3,353 euros.\nIn Poland, the parliamentary",
        "baseline": " salary is pegged to a vice-minister’s salary and reaches about 8,000 litas. Poland’s members of parliament, who have no permanent accommodation in the Polish capital, are entitled to stay at the parliamentary hotel. If there is not enough space, the legislators get budget money for renting apartments. Differently from Lithuanian MPs, their Polish counterparts can ride public transport and fly some local air routes free of charge.\nWhen it comes to parliament members’ aides, Greece lavishes the most for them, allowing an MP to hire a science consultant and four secretaries. In most European countries MPs are entitled to have only one paid aid while, for example, in the Netherlands, several legislators share the same aide’s assistance.\nIn regards to this, Lithuanian MPs, with 3 aides on average, are on par with French legislators. In Latvia, a Saeima member usually has 2 aides and Estonian parliamentarians do without any aides at all.",

In the meantime, if you’re experiencing any withdrawal, follow us on Twitter.\n...or remembering the Exodus from Egypt.\nwe wish you a happy and healthy Passover -- Chag Kasher V’Sameach!\nTOP TALKER -- “Shake-Up Remakes Kushner’s Role” by Peter Nicholas and Felicia Schwartz: \"The nomination of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and the appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser could also curb Mr. Kushner’s sway if foreign diplomats, who have been courting the president’s son-in-law as an alternative to Mr. Tillerson, turn more to the traditional U.S. diplomatic machinery... In talking with friends, Mr. Kushner has joked about the Middle East views of Mr. Bolton... The “Orthodox Jews” working toward a Middle East peace deal... are now looking like “the moderates,” Mr. Kushner has told people.\"\nREGIME CHANGE OR MAYBE SAUDI-LED DEAL? -- “U.S. ambassador to Israel: If Abbas won't negotiate, someone else will” by Barak Ravid: “David Friedman made his comments in an interview with a newspaper called \"Shviee\" which is distributed in synagogues in Israel \"Time doesn’t stand stilland if he is not interested is negotiating – I am sure somebody else will. Vacuums tend to be filled. If [Mahmoud Abbas] creates a vacuum I am sure somebody will fill it. And we will move forward (on the peace process). The U.S. wants to help the Palestinian people – if the leadership is not on the same page then so be it, but we will not abandon the desire to improve the life of Palestinians.\"\nSIGHTING: Trump’s Mideast Envoy Jason Greenblatt walking yesterday at 6th Avenue and 57th Street in NYC. Worth noting: Saudi Crown Prince MBS had been staying in the neighborhood.\n\"Does Israel need France more than France needs Israel?\" by Rina Bassist: \"Netanyahu is heavily invested in Trump, but this does not mean that he will neglect the rest of the world, especially Europe. He knows that if there is one European leader that Trump likes, it's French President Emmanuel Macron. He also knows that if Trump’s Middle East peace plan fails, the European Union is likely to step in... European foreign policy is being championed and shaped by the pro-EU Macron, especially on the Iranian file. Both Jerusalem and Washington share this assessment of Macron, although he has so far failed to change Trump’s mind on Iran.\"\nSTART UP NATION: \"A Big Chunk of Israel's Tech Scene is Actually Based in New York\" by Gerrit De Vynck: \"More than 350 startups with Israeli founders have set up shop in New York, up from 60 five years ago, says Guy Franklin, general manager of SOSA NYC, a local tech hub for his countrymen and who has cataloged the phenomenon.

        "prompt": "You are to submit your programs to Gradebot before uploading them to SmartSite. Gradebot will grade their correctness. What follows assumes that you have your Gradebot keys set up properly; if not, see the handout All About Homework to learn how to do this.\nProblem 6 asks you to write a function to read an integer; the interface is documents in the assignment.\nTo help you, we have placed the input for Gradebot in the directory /home/bishop/ecs30/hw3-6-input in the CSIF. There is also a driver, /home/bishop/ecs30/getintdriver.c, that is the same as the one Gradebot uses to link to your function. That driver prints the outputs that Gradebot will use to evaluate your function. Of course, your function should pront nothing.\nNow you have a program with the required interface — assuming your function getint works correctly.\nto create my Gradebot work area. That area is now in the directory named “4”.\nWhen you want to submit your function for grading, copy it into the directory “4”. You should not submit “getintdriver.c”. If you do, Gradebot will ignore it, so no harm done. But Gradebot has the same driver, and uses its copy to compile the program. This means, of course, Gradebot will ignore any changes to “getintdriver.c” that you make, even if you submit it.\nThe first command informs git that you have added a (new or changed) file to the repository.\nand the editor will come up.\nThe third command actually pushes your file over to Gradebot, which will promptly run it. It may take a minute or two, especially if a lot of people are using Gradebot at the time, so look at the “Submissions being graded” and “Submissions to be graded” part of the Gradebot window.\nOnce you have finished the programs and are happy with the results, you have to submit the files to the homework area in SmartSite. You can do this by physically going to the CSIF and uploading them there. Or, you can transfer them to your laptop or home computer and upload them from there. If you do the latter, watch out for character conversion problems. The ASCII printing characters will be transferred correctly, except for the end of line marker; this may be changed to a carriage return, a line feed, or some combination of the two. But if you have non-ASCII characters such as any accented letters, emoticons, or non-Latin letters, those will probably not transfer correctly.\nIf you have trouble getting Gradebot to run your program, but have done so successfully before, then the problem is almost certainly not your key. Try the following steps.\nFirst, be sure you are looking at the current version of the Gradebot page. Gradebot does not send updates to your browser; you have to pull them over. So try refreshing the window in your browser. Check the time when you submitted your last version. If Gradebot didn’t run your program, then go on to the next step.\nNext, be sure you have set up your work area and you execute the three git commands from within that directory. It’s very common to forget the first or second command, or to execute the commands in the parent directory, and in these cases the program won’t get sent over to Gradebot.\nthis is almost certainly what caused the failure. Find the right working area, change to it, and rerun the command.\nIf none of these are it, here are a couple of other things to check.\nYou submitted it in the wrong work area. For example, you put “getint.c” in an old working directory, like “2” or “3” (it should be in directory “4’). If you see the following error message in the box on the Messages page, this is almost certainly",

If you use the -a option on this command, you may have put “#” as the first character of the line. Delete that. The “#” at the beginning means the line is a comment and so is ignored.\nYou made no changes to the source code. The program will be pushed over, but Gradebot will compare it to what you submitted before. If you haven’t made any changes, Gradebot thinks it has already run the program, and won’t do it again. In this case, just find a comment and add a blank to it (or make any other change). Then rerun the three git commands again.",

To Sinn Féin, this is a breach of trust, evidence of the Democratic Unionist Party’s ‘arrogance’ and their lack of respect for Irish identity.\nBut it matters more broadly to nationalists and native Irish speakers because of the effects of centuries of British rule, which saw determined attempts to wipe out the Irish language altogether.\nThe Democratic Unionists, often derisory about the importance of Irish for the most sectarian of motives, now complain about the costs, putting the price of implementing a language strategy at £100m. There is no credible basis for this figure and most estimates put the costs of adding bilingual road signs and the like at a twentieth of that.\nTrue, the implications may rise if Irish is put on a par with, say, the Welsh language, which is now embedded in the fabric of the judicial system and public sector. But if it can be done in Wales, why not in Northern Ireland?\nCultural respect matters and the point of the Good Friday Agreement was to accommodate Irish identity within the context of the overall deal.\nAlas, part of the reason the Executive collapsed in January was because the DUP’s communities minister, Paul Givan, axed a grant to an Irish language charity while rewarding unionist marching bands instead.\nLost amid the fallout from the elections, however, was the successful legal challenge mounted by an Irish language group over the failure to implement a strategy for the Irish language.\nHere’s the thing. If James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland Secretary, was smart, he would remove this particular obstacle by pointing out to the DUP that the High Court decision offers a climbdown and honourable retreat on this issue. (Pedants may argue a ‘strategy’ is not an ‘act,’ but this is",
        "baseline": " splitting hairs).\nHe could then address the cost issue by simply underwriting the costs of implementing an Irish Language Act/strategy.\nEven if Arlene Foster’s ludicrous overestimate was even remotely accurate, picking up the tab would be a drop in the Irish Sea. Cheaper, certainly than the inducements that will otherwise be needed to get everyone around the table if this process collapses.\nSuch a move would help to break the stalemate that looks likely scuttle talks this week. With the Irish Foreign Minister, Charlie Flanagan, joining the negotiations today it might be the last best chance to avert the cliff edge.\nWill Brokenshire seize the initiative?\nNot one penny of taxpayers money should go towards this language. If fundamentalists want it then they should pay for it.\nCancer patients mightn’t have the drugs they require because of cost but will be able to insist on being informed of this in Irish.

Patient-initiated research is especially appealing to people with rare diseases whom researchers can't easily find.\nKatherine Leon says she spends up to 12 hours a day online interacting with others who share her rare heart condition.\nPeople with extremely rare diseases are often scattered across the world, and any one hospital has a hard time locating enough individuals to conduct meaningful research.\nBut one woman with an extremely rare heart condition managed to do what many hospitals couldn't. Katherine Leon connected with enough people online to interest the Mayo Clinic in a research trial.\nLeon was 38, in great health and had just given birth to a baby boy. Then the unexpected happened: She had a heart attack.\nShe was diagnosed with something called spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. Leon didn't have high cholesterol, and her arteries weren't blocked by the typical atherosclerotic plaques that one finds in most patients with heart disease.\nInstead, the walls of her arteries had torn, and tiny fragments of tissue had blocked the flow of blood to her heart. It's a condition that affects primarily women, and it's also very rare — so rare her doctors told her that there were hardly enough people to study it. Leon recalls being dumbfounded.\n\"In this day in age, to have a type of heart attack that had not been researched just seemed ridiculous,\" Leon says.\nSo ridiculous that Leon says once she recovered from double bypass surgery she decided to do something about it. She started looking for other SCAD patients on the Internet.\nIt took her a year to find her first patient. And another year or longer to find three more. And then, in 2007, the nonprofit advocacy organization WomenHeart partnered with a company, Inspire, to create WomenHeart Support Community on Inspire. It was through that online community that Leon began finding other SCAD patients around the world.\n\"If they Googled SCAD — boom — up would pop our conversation and they could join right in. So that's when the numbers really exploded,\" Leon says. \"And you know, every week we would get a few more and a few more, so that was really exciting.\"\nAs the numbers of SCAD patients grew, Leon kept track of them, taking notes on their age and medical information.\n\"I just kept a running document on the computer. And as it grew, that's when I thought, OK, research would be viable,\" Leon says. \"This would definitely be something that I could compile and take to a doctor someday and try to convince them to research it.\"\nEventually Leon found the opportunity she needed. At a symposium run by womenheart.com at the Mayo Clinic, she spotted cardiologist Sharonne Hayes.\n\"She came up to me during one of the breaks at the meeting,\" Hayes says, \"and she said, 'Oh, Dr. Hayes, what's Mayo doing for research on SCAD?' \"\n\"And she said, 'Well, we aren't doing anything,'\" Leon says. \"I said that I knew over 70 women through an online community who had it all over the world, that we were in contact.\"\nShe asked Hayes if she would be willing to research SCAD, and Hayes said she would.\nHayes set up a virtual patient registry and allowed patients from all over the world submit their medical records and scans online. In the first trial, Mayo enrolled 12 patients — and had to turn people away.\nHayes is now working on a second trial where she hopes to enroll as many as 200 patients. She says traditionally, one of the biggest barriers to studying rare diseases are the privacy laws that make",
        "baseline": " it difficult to access hard-to-find patients.\n\"I could not legally, ethically send out an email to all Mayo patients for instance, and say, \"Oh, anybody got SCAD? You want to sign up for my study?\" she says.\nBut the rise of social media has allowed patients to do for themselves what researchers like Hayes can't: spread information about research. Through their personal Facebook pages, chat rooms and message boards, patients are recruiting each other in a kind of virtual word-of-mouth.\n\"This is not investigator-initiated research, this is patient-initiated research,\" Hayes says, \"and to a certain extent has been patient-sustained research in the case of our study.\"\nLeon sees herself, and other patients like her, as needles in a giant haystack; the Internet was simply the best way to sort themselves out. If more people could do that, she says, there'd be huge progress.",

His youngest, another son, is approaching 30. He's intelligent and capable, yet he's barely supporting himself at menial jobs, still taking college classes, and has no sense of what he wants to do with his life. By contrast, my buddy's daughter, the middle child, is a go-getter. She's a top performer at her workplace and seems overall in command of her life.\nFor the first time in any culture at any time in history, females are emancipating earlier and more successfully than males. This crop of young adult males is shaping up to be the most underachieving generation of men (perpetual boys?) to inhabit the USA.\nI shared the following observation with a recent audience, “When one hears of an individual in their mid-30s who's still living at home or largely dependent on parents for support and has no clear sense of direction in life, it's almost always a male.” Everywhere, heads nodded.\nIt would be simplistic to attribute the collapse of the American male on one variable, but I think the main problem is that the role of father has been diminished by several factors, beginning with the most obvious: the father-absent home.\nInvolved dads push their sons to grow up and accept responsibility and encourage their daughters to find men who are grown up and responsible. The less involved the father, especially during the pre-teen and teen years, the less able he is to be that influence in his children's lives.\nThe divorce rate has contributed greatly to the diminishment of male influence in child rearing, but the problem is compounded by divorced dads who, when they're with their kids, are little more than Good Time Charlies. The Disneyland Dad winds up enforcing little responsibility. This does not send a good message to children, especially sons.\nBut even many",

Dad, your son doesn't need a 30- or 40-something-year-old buddy (this applies to your daughter as well). He needs a dad who steps up to the plate of leadership.\nThen there's what I term the Magnificent Maternal Micromanager, the mom who not only micromanages her children's lives, but micromanages her husband as well, directing him as to how to be a father. The result is almost inevitably a milquetoast dad who's allowed himself to be stripped of masculine virtue.

According to Gallup's \"State of the American Workplace\" survey, 43 percent of working Americans occasionally work remotely and over a third of workers would change jobs for the opportunity to do so.\nWorking from home provides workers with flexibility and can allow them to save money on expenses. Remote jobs site FlexJobs estimates that working from home can save workers as much as $4,668, while Quartz calculates that telecommuters can save $2,524 a year.\nAnd in some special roles, workers can also make serious cash. FlexJobs used salary data provided by compensation specialists at Glassdoor to determine the highest-paying remote jobs. What they found was that a surprising number of traditionally high-paying roles are becoming more available to to telecommuters. That means that highly-trained workers can make six-figures working from their couches.\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Data architects design, create, deploy and manage companies' data architecture. A degree in computer science is typically required.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Strategy managers help companies grow and set goals by formulating actionable plans. Project management and statistical knowledge is often required.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Financial planning and analysis managers will typically oversee the financial planning process, including annual budgeting and forecasting, and provide insights on improving efficiency.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Solutions architects create and deliver solution architectures that meet client needs, assure delivery teams are aware of the required objectives and obtain positive feedback from the customer.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Engineering managers can find remote positions where they will architect and write scalable full-stack code, perform code reviews and encourage proper architecture, planning and implementation process.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Some of the duties of a remote software architect include understanding product system requirements and architecture, maintaining an architecture roadmap and designing core architecture.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Licensed nurse practitioners can remotely triage and provide medical care, provide medical and wellness education, diagnose and treat patients and assist with care coordination.\"\nJob description from FlexJobs: \"Software engineering is a popular category for remote work.

Duties will typically include providing patient consultation, diagnosing and prescribing medicine.\"\nPhysicians topped FlexJobs' list as the highest-paying remote job, thanks to advancements in technology that have transformed how doctors treat patients.
