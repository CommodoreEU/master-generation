        "prompt": "“We don’t want to have a depleted military, fighting all over the place,” Trump said, words many people heard with excitement, misunderstanding him that this meant less war, and peace in our time, as he simultaneously vowed to boost defense spending.\nHe wants to do this, he says, so that America maintains military dominance, to “ward off any threats”. But we know that when American presidents speak of “warding off threats” they are speaking of nations that refuse to kowtow to them. They want to maintain their military dominance, not because of any threats, for no one threatens them except in their imagination, or on the fields of battle of the nations they have invaded and occupied, or themselves actively threaten, but because without that dominance they cannot break the arms of those that choose to live outside their shadow, nor bribe the rest, since loss of military dominance would mean the end of the hegemony of the dollar, whose inflated value depends on American military tyranny.\nThis aggressive policy he describes as “Peace through strength,” words that speak volumes about the thrust of the incoming president’s foreign policy since it is the same phrase that Ronald Reagan used to justify the massive military buildup during Reagan’s two terms in office that led, in part to the destruction of the Soviet Union.\nThis is the same policy of “peace through strength” that saw Reagan try to overturn the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua, using the terrorists known as the “contras” to tear Nicaragua apart until the Sandinistas were forced from power.\nThis is the same policy that saw the US supporting the suppression of the popular left movement in El Salvador where US death squads murdered thousands, and supporting the abduction and murder of thousands of leftists across Latin America in Operation Condor. In 1983 Reagan ordered the invasion and destruction of the socialist government of the tiny island of Grenada. He supported Baby Doc Duvalier in Haiti and his ton tons macoutes, Marcos in Philippines, the white apartheid government of South Africa, egged on both sides in the Iraq-Iran War while selling weapons to them both and used Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan to destroy its socialist government and harass the USSR there.\nTrump, in effect has just announced the official resumption of the Cold War, that euphemism for a heightened state of threat and insecurity provoked by the United States in order to intimidate the rest of the world and during which real wars take place while total war is daily threatened.\nThe evidence that American foreign policy will be just as aggressive with Trump as it would have been with Clinton is clear. Anyone who doubts it need only look at General “Mad Dog” Mattis and his appointment as Secretary of Defence, and the appointment of another aggressive general, and head of military intelligence, Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser. He will appoint Marine General John Kelly to head of “Homeland” security. Another general, the disgraced Petraeus, is being considered as Director of National Intelligence, or as UN ambassador.\nTrump’s continuation of America’s belligerence was signaled with the insult to China when he accepted a call from the leader of the government of the Chinese province of Taiwan, the island to which the Kuomintang anti-communist forces fled in 1949. It has long been the policy of the United States to accept Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and therefore the US has no official diplomatic links with Taiwan as a sovereign state. The Chinese regard Taiwan as a rebel province and so any attempt by a foreign head of state to communicate with its government should go through Beijing. Trump deliberately threw that respect for China down the drain by openly talking with the Taiwanese leader who is known to want to make Taiwan independent. For the Chinese this was taken as a signal that the US recognizes Taiwan as independent, and the US meant it to be seen as such. The Chinese protested angrily and warned of trouble in reaction.\nAll the words of oil poured on these troubled waters by the Obama administration to reassure China that things will stay as they have been are meaningless since this phone call is just a natural and logical advancement of Obama’s “pivot to Asia,” that is the US intention to reduce China to a dependency or at least a vassal state that needs US permission to sail in its own waters while the Americans presume to own its seas and coasts.\nTrump’s action is completely in line with the increasing aggression by the United States towards China evidenced by Obama’s shifting of large portions of the American navy and air forces to the Pacific and South China Seas, including the transfer last summer of B1 and B2 bombers to Guam which can be used to carry nuclear tipped cruise missiles and by the routine violation of Chinese territorial waters by American warships all this year. The appointment of Iowa governor Branstad as US ambassador to China, a man who has connections in China, does not offer any real hope of Trump moderating American policy towards China. All that appointment means is that Branstad will be used as the nice cop while the US Navy sits off the Chinese coast waiting to come in as the bad cop if Branstad can’t sweet talk the Chinese into surrendering their sovereignty.\nMeanwhile NATO aggression against Russia continues, “sanctions” have increased and been renewed to a permanent state, and the anti-Russian propaganda, already at hysterical levels, is maintained with the appearance in the Washington Post of a list of news media, journals and blogs considered to be “Russian agents.” It is clear that this list was put together and released, through the device of a front group called Propornot, by American intelligence services.\nThis is a dangerous step and threatens further action aimed at suppressing the alternative media and writers that oppose US aggressive foreign policy and the regressive and cruel economic policies inflicted on the people of the United States by its industrial-financial ruling class. Already the media are full of stories about “fake” news and what is and what is not. We are now forced to continually defend ourselves as the ones writing about the real facts while the mass media put out the fabrications and distortions. It is difficult enough to get the facts out without having to defend against charges of serving the “enemy” while doing so.\nTrump’s complaint that America is “fighting in areas we shouldn’t be fighting in” is not a sign of a man of peace but of a man who has listened to those American military strategists who realize that the objective of trying to seize the oil supplies of Iraq, Iran and Russia through attacking the periphery of Asia is not working due to local resistance and help given to the resistance by Russia, China, Iran and others. So the strategy will shift further towards conflict with the larger powers that stand in the way of US global hegemony. Once they are neutralized then local resistance will be easier to deal with.\nThis is confirmed by the release by the Pentagon of its latest National Military Strategy, dated 2015, that states its primary purpose is to maintain an “international order advanced by US leadership” for the benefit of a “a US economy in an open international economic system.” It then lists the main obstacles to achieving this dominance, Russia, primarily, then China, Iran and North Korea, which are described as threats to American national interests.\n“International order advanced by US leadership,” means an American world order, that is American rule of the world, and for the sole benefit of American capitalism. The defeat of the US and EU in Syria will not lead to a lull in American imperialism. We must remember that the Reagan military build up to create “peace through strength” was a reaction to the strategic defeat of the United States in Vietnam which in turn was partly due to Soviet assistance in the Vietnam war during which the Soviet air defence forces aiding the Vietnamese inflicted massive losses on American air forces.",

        "prompt": "Yarto Yowa the fakir causes his assistant to lie on a bed of swords in Rome, circa 1950.\nWhat it’s about: Dying is easy. Comedy is hard. So goes the old actors’ saying, and sadly, some know from experience. Through the ages, actors, musicians, and other performers have gone out on a high note, leaving this mortal coil before the crowd could ask for an encore.\nBiggest controversy: Another old saying goes, “Guns don’t kill people—no, wait, that’s stupid, of course they do.” The “bullet catch” magic trick, which felled last week’s subject, the white man who performed as Chung Ling Soo, has claimed many magicians. In 1820, Madame Delinsky was accidentally shot when one of the six (!) gunmen shooting at her mistakenly used a live round. In 1840, Arnold Buck gave a gun to a volunteer from the audience, who used a blank bullet per the trick, but also surreptitiously inserted nails into the gun barrel.\nGuns are deadly to non-magicians, too. In 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum was bored on the set of the TV series Cover Up, unloaded the blanks in a prop gun and amused himself by pretending to play Russian roulette. Except he had forgotten to unload one blank, and had the bad luck to spin the cylinder to that chamber. The force of the blank firing at close range was enough to kill him. And famously, Brandon Lee was killed in 1993 while filming The Crow when a prop gun was improperly loaded, causing a blank shot to propel a bullet stuck in the barrel from a previous misfire at Lee.\nNot all onstage gun deaths are accidental. Jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan was shot and killed on stage by his wife in 1972. Pantera guitarist “Dimebag” Darrell Abbott was performing with his post-Pantera band, Damageplan, in 2004, when a gunmen leapt on stage, shooting and killing Abbott and three others. And in 2013, Brazil’s “King Of Funk,” MC Daleste, was shot in the abdomen in front of a crowd of 4,000 people, dying later that day.\nStrangest fact: One of the numerous traditional actors’ superstitions (and for those of you out there reading, good luck, and… Macbeth!), the color green being bad luck dates back to one of the earliest recorded (at least, by Wikipedia) onstage deaths. French actor and playwright Molière, whose works are still performed at the Comédie-Française more than any other playwright, died in 1673 while starring in one of his own plays, Le Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac). Contrary to the title, Molière had a very real case of tuberculosis, had a violent coughing fit during the play, and died on stage. He was wearing green at the time, and the color has been bad luck ever since.\nThing we were happiest to learn: Not much to be happy about on a list of deaths, apart from some lives well lived. In 2016, Jane Little, a bassist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra collapsed at the end of a performance’s final number, “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” No one knew that better than Little, who died at 87 after performing with the orchestra for 71 years. The following year, jam-band staple Colonel Bruce Hampton died on his 70th birthday, surrounded by friends and admirers, during an all-star concert to honor the occasion.\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Wrestling may be fake, but the danger is real. In 1969, Mike DiBiase (adoptive father of Ted “The Million Dollar Man” DiBiase) died of a heart attack in the middle of a match. Three years later, Luther Lindsay, one of the first black pro wrestlers to become a major star, died while performing the winning move in a match. In 1987, British wrestler “King Kong” Kirk died of a pre-existing heart condition when his opponent landed on him. In 1993, Larry Cameron died of a heart attack during a match. Japanese wrestler Mitsuhara Misawa and Mexican wrestler Perro Aguayo Jr. each suffered cervical spine injuries in the ring which led to immediate cardiac arrest and death. And in 1999, Owen Hart (brother and tag-team partner of Bret “The Hitman” Hart) made his entrance to a pay-per-view event gliding down from the roof of the arena, when the safety harness released, dropping him 78 feet onto the ropes. His aorta tore, his lungs filled with blood, and he died shortly after.\nFurther down the Wormhole: Hard to",

Besides introducing a generation of viewers to wildlife of all sorts, Irwin was a devoted conservationist, working to protect endangered animals and habitat, and protesting poaching-derived items like turtle shells or shark fin soup.\nShark fins are usually fished by removing them from a shark and throwing its body back into the sea, and overfishing is endangering shark populations around the world. (While the movies make sharks out to be terrifying predators of humans, in fact the reverse is true, with sharks killing a single-digit number of humans each year and humans killing millions of sharks.) The United States has made some efforts to protect some sharks, in no small part because of the landmark court case United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds Of Shark Fins.

        "prompt": "Here are the food-service offerings from several of the more popular airlines, along with Diet Detective’s comments and ratings (Health score: 5 stars = highest rating.\nComments: The airline continues to improve upon its food and its transparency. VA has such a commitment to food, I just don’t understand why it don’t offer healthy individual snacks — nothing even close. How about an apple or an orange? I am impressed that the average meal has dropped by 24.38 calories. But calories aren’t everything.\nBest bets: Avoid the individual snack if you can. Even the nuts, which are the best choice, are high in calories if you consume the entire package. Always choose a real meal if you can. Even if it’s slightly more calories, it will keep you full longer.\nComments: Delta continues its commitment to improving its food in terms of health and consciousness. Over the summer, the airline launched new menus called Flight Fuel, which replaced the EATS program. The new menus attempt to focus on “transparency into ingredient and allergen information for customers.” Along with the new Flight Fuel launch, Delta also upped its nutrition game this year by providing a key on the menu for snack items that are non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and lacto-ovo vegetarian. Also, the tapas box is the U.S. airline industry’s only non-GMO snack box.\nDelta continues to work with Luvo (www.Luvoinc.com), which has a very strong commitment to healthy eating. All the calorie information for the Luvo items are listed on Delta’s menu (and online); but be aware that the calories listed apply only to the individual sandwich or wrap, not the entire meal — which can be confusing if you don’t see the asterisk.\nBest bets: For a snack, the nuts are the best choice — even over the lower-calorie pretzels. The vegan, gmo-free tapas snack box is a good healthy choice if you share or make it a meal (it’s too high in calories as a snack). The best bests are the super seed crackers, Snapea Crisps, dark chocolate, almonds, hummus, and quinoa with pepper dip.\nComments: The individual snacks are still low in calories as well as nutritional value. The airline continues to post nutritional information for its meals, however, it doesn’t post the nutritional information for snacks. The a la carte snacks are no longer available, but they were high in calories. Once an innovator in the air, JetBlue, the sixth-largest U.S. carrier, has certainly fallen behind in the food department. We need to see more foods like Chobani yogurt, and fewer Cheez-Its.\nBest bets: Still not too much in the way of healthy individual snacks. As for the meal boxes, we still like the Pump Up, which has healthy ingredients (Mary’s Gone Crackers-Original, olives, hummus and bean crisps), but remember that it’s a meal and should not be eaten as a snack (skip the olives if you are sodium sensitive). Skip the other meal boxes, which are high in calories and fat and offer little in terms of nutrition. If you are on a flight that offers the Eat Up Café, the yogurt and granola (you might want to limit the honey), the kale and quinoa salad and the spicy soba and Korean-style chicken are all good choices.\nComments: United’s individual snacks are up in average calories from 283 to 375.6, but the overall calorie count for everything is only slightly higher. United is the fourth-largest airline in the U.S.; it should be thinking about healthy food. Years ago, it was No. 1 in this area. The breakfast, lunch and dinner menu has many new options; however, healthy meal choices are limited.\nBest bets: Among the individual snacks, the hummus is the best choice. Or else share the Sweet & Savory Bistro Blend Trail Mix with at least a few others. Get the tapas snack box, which is high in calories but has many healthy foods, including almonds, olives, hummus and bruschetta; just toss out the cheese spread. For breakfast, your best bet is the chicken sausage egg skillet, but skip the chicken sausage to save calories. Also, skip the ham baguette. For lunch/dinner, the airline removed last year’s best bet, the wrap and salad combo. The new options are not great; however, the Mediterranean chicken wrap is your best bet and should keep you full.\nComments: American now provides complimentary snacks on flights of more than 250 miles — not healthy ones though. The average number of calories per meal has gone done, other than the snack boxes (398 to 497). Unfortunately, AA decided to remove the chicken Cobb salad, which was one of our Best Bets last year, and replaced it with a higher-calorie turkey and chutney sandwich.\nFurthermore, we were unhappy to find out that the Fort Worth-based airline decided not to publish food menu information on its website, a strange move leading to even less food transparency. The airline continues to lose out on what could be a tremendous financial opportunity — healthy foods often have larger profit margins and customers will be happier.\nBest bets: For individual snacks, the hummus and chips is still your best choice. Skip the snack box unless you toss the salami and cheese. The Thai ginger chicken wrap is a good choice, but skip the sesame-ginger dressing. For breakfast on flights of more than two but less than three hours, there’s not much to eat; and while the trail mix may seem like a healthy choice, it’s very high in calories. On flights of three hours or more, the breakfast sandwich is an OK choice as long as you go light on the honey mustard dressing.\nComments: Not much variety and not much in terms of nutritional value. We wish it would add some healthy snacks or at least test a few. The Dallas-based airline is one of the larger carriers in the U.S., so it would be great for Southwest to set an example and show that healthy food can sell if it is tasty and curated with consciousness.\nBest bet: The peanuts are the best, even though the pretzels are lower in calories. There haven’t been many healthy changes to the menu, and don’t be fooled by the word “veggie” in the wheat thins.\nComments: The airline’s media spokesperson doesn’t respond to emails or calls. Paraphrasing him from previous years: passengers should bring their own food and drinks. But in my opinion, the airline has a responsibility to serve foods that are healthier. The good news: The calorie count has gone down from last year to 366. The bad news is that there are few healthy options.\nBest bet: The cup of noodle soup at 290 calories is still the only choice that will feel like a real meal, but it is very high in sodium, so it is not the best bet for someone who is sodium-sensitive or has high blood pressure. All the muffins are at least 400 calories — not the best choices unless you split one (if you’re the type of person who can do that). The chips and salsa is the lowest-calorie choice of all the snacks but probably won’t fill you up. Skip the snack box.\nComments: The PR team was back with its typical nasty, condescending tone. Here is an abbreviated quote from the email: “Without",

Also, calories and offerings are moving in the wrong direction. Calories are up over last year.\nBest bets: Perhaps the trail mix — but we had to estimate the calories and don’t know the nutrient values. Also, if you’re not sodium sensitive you can grab the jerky.\nVirgin America, 4.25 stars; Delta, 4 stars; JetBlue, 3.5 stars; United Airlines, 3.25 stars; American, 3 stars; Southwest Airlines, 2 stars; Spirit Airlines, 1; Frontier Air, 1 star.",

Unfortunately, we are not in the business of providing healthy food.” I’m not sure what the PR person is smoking, but I’m not buying it. Of course, it’s not a restaurant, but it is a food-service business. United, Delta, JetBlue, American, Southwest, Virgin America and Alaska all have food-service businesses. Regardless, the airline continues to offer the same old unhealthy snacks and meals. No changes.\nBest bet: The pretzels are the best choice, but they are not very filling. Very few healthy options.

Keep in mind that the body needs a healthy balance of all food groups in order to maintain good health.” Nice response, but it doesn’t answer the question. Just because a food has zinc doesn’t mean it’s good for you. Get your facts straight.\nBest bets: The airline’s individual snack choices are still low in calories, but they do not offer nutritional value. Skip the individual snack and go with an actual meal. Virgin America is one of the few airlines to offer a vegan meal, which is a step in the right direction. Don’t be fooled by the salad, which is a",
            "llm_senso_redgreen_medium": " naming the study, I must say it seems to me to offer a very narrow view and to draw some very broad conclusions.” Still, no comment about specific information. I guess the calorie count is not important. I do appreciate that the spokesperson still sends me links and menus every month to keep track of the food changes on Spirit; however, this doesn’t make up the loss of the meal and the removal of healthy food and transparency on the site. Spirit and Frontier are not even close to their major airline counterparts in this category.\nBest Bet: The peanuts and pretzels. Skip any muffin or snack box, and skip any sandwich wrap.",
            "llm_acro_redgreen_medium": " knowing which flight, meal and passenger we are talking about, there are a number of factors at play that could have affected the calorie count. You can’t just look at the calorie count, you need to know what the passenger is eating and what they are drinking. Juice, soda, water and beer can all affect the calorie count. Our meals are designed for the passenger to get what they need to get through their flight.” So basically, you can’t trust what they tell you. I have been on flights with this same meal and the calorie count was the same, and the flight attendants told me exactly how many calories I was eating. You can’t make up a story like that. By the way, this was the same response I got last year.\nBest bet: The hummus is the only snack that is not a high-calorie, low-nutrition snack. For a meal, you can’t beat the turkey, cheese, and fruit. Unfortunately, this meal is only available",

My approach is to go with information and data that is the least likely to be biased in favor of the subject of the study, and that usually comes directly from the subject of the study, in this case United Airlines. Not to worry. My back is not against the wall; I have a very thick skin.\nBest bets: The hummus and pretzels is the lowest-calorie and the only snack that is the least likely to go stale. XO Bistro chips and humus is the next best snack. Either of these snack choices is the only thing that comes the closest to healthy. Jet Blue did not respond. My guess is that they really don’t want to know what I think about them because their food is pretty awful. Really, there are not a lot of healthy food choices on the Jet Blue menu. Yo"

And the final count is likely to be even higher because 15 more suspicious deaths are still being investigated.\nIt�s all about pressure and the military approach, said Kim Ruocco, 45, whose Marine husband was an officer and Cobra helicopter pilot who hanged himself in a California hotel room in 2005. That was one month before he was to return to Iraq a second time.\nShe said her husband, John, had completed 75 missions in Iraq and was struggling with anxiety and depression but felt he�d be letting others down if he sought help and couldn�t return.\nRuocco, of Newbury, Mass., was recently hired to be suicide support coordinator for the nonprofit Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. She said she feels that the military has finally started to reach out to suicide survivors and seek solutions.\n�Things move slowly, but I think they�re really trying,� Ruocco said.\nAt the Pentagon yesterday, Col. Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatric consultant to the Army surgeon general, made a plea for more professionals to sign on to work for the military.\n�We are hiring and we need your help,� she said.\nMilitary leaders promised fresh prevention efforts will start next week.\nThe new suicide figure compares with 115 in 2007 and 102 in 2006 and is the highest since current record-keeping began in 1980. Officials expect the deaths to amount to a rate of 20.2 per 100,000 soldiers, which is higher than the civilian rate �",

For example, the child was in fact fostered by an English speaking family of mixed race.\nJudge Sapnara said her decision remove the child from foster care was not taken “as a result of undue media involvement” but rather “because of the evidence available to the court today, that the grandmother is an appropriate carer for the child",

The judge ordered the council to conduct an urgent investigation into issues reported by The Times, saying the newspaper had acted responsibly in raising “very concerning” matters of “legitimate public interest”‘.

It contains stem cells that can be used to regrow blood and bone-marrow cells, and to treat diseases such as leukemia and some immune disorders.\nMonday's funding announcement by provincial and territorial health ministers aims to fill a 2007 call for a national, taxpayer-supported approach.\n\"Something that's otherwise medical waste has the opportunity to save a life,\" said Sue Smith, executive director of OneMatch Stem Cell and Marrow Network at Canadian Blood Services (CBS) in Halifax.\nThe blood agency will develop and manage the cord blood bank.\n\"This is a game changer for Canadian patients. It allows us to really target the unique needs that Canada has.\"\nProvinces and territories have long recognized the need for a public bank, said Nova Scotia Minister of Health and Wellness in announcing the investment.\nThere are currently more than 800 people who need a stem cell transplant in Canada, Smith noted.\nIt is estimated about 70 per cent of patients who require a stem cell transplant must look outside their families for a match and have the best chance of finding it within their own ethnic group. A national, public umbilical cord blood bank will improve the chance of finding high-quality cord blood for patients, according to CBS.\n\"Every year, I still encounter children even with the existing cord blood banks that I can't find a donor for,\" said Dr. John Doyle, who specializes in blood and marrow transplantation at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.\n\"I'm hoping by us going to our own community to get cord bloods that I will be able to find a donor for those children.\"\nThe national plan will be implemented over eight years, starting next month in Ottawa. It aims to bank 20,000 cord blood units, and will include two accredited cord blood stem cell labs and a collections network across Canada, CBS said.\nThe approval includes a fundraising campaign by the blood agency that aims to build national support for the bank. The three-year campaign aims to raise $12.5 million of the investment.\nParents will be able to choose to donate their children's umbilical cords anonymously to a public umbilical cord blood bank, making their donations available for any patient in need.\nOver the next two years, the blood agency will develop procedures to build the bank, and a cord blood stem lab will be established in Ottawa.\nThe project",

At that point, people will be able use special kits to donate and send cord blood to their nearest centre.\nQuebec runs its own cord blood banking program through Héma-Québec.\nSince stem cells from cord blood are more flexible than bone marrow, the match between donor and recipient does not have to be as close.\nIn 2007, experts said a representative sample of 10,000 donations from the country's diverse population would probably be enough for use in Canada and international recipients when there is a match.\nCanada has 10 private cord blood banks, which offer to store frozen cord blood for years for use by a child's own family. The companies charge about $1,000 up front, and another $100 or so annually to store the cord blood.\nThe Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and the American Academy of Pediatrics do not routinely recommend private cord blood banking.",
