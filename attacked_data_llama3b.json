        "prompt": "UL baseball: What is the Cajuns' plan for bringing back Leger?\nUsual Friday-night starter Gunner Leger worked out of the bullpen over the weekend, but how long will that last?\nThe Ragin’ Cajuns have a plan for getting Gunner Leger back to his usual self, and it’s begun — as foreshadowed a week ago — in the bullpen for the former Friday-night starter.\nPitching for the first time since going 5.0 innings in a loss at Little Rock on March 15, Leger — hampered by arm inflammation — worked one scoreless inning with one hit allowed to close a 4-3 win at Troy on Sunday.\n“He will continue to stay in the bullpen with us,” UL head coach Tony Robichaux said Monday, “until he builds those pitch counts back up (enough) that he feels comfortable with to be able to go out and ultimately start.\nLeger, a fifth-year senior, was the 2017 Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Year. He was a Golden Spikes Award semifinalist that season. And he got selected by Miami in the 26th round of that year’s Major League Baseball Draft.\nThe Marlins offered him sixth-round money to sign and leave UL after his junior season.\nBut Leger opted to stay, then underwent surgery to remove a calcified cyst from his thigh bone and partial Tommy John surgery on his elbow as well.\nBoth procedures were performed in 2017, and Leger sat out all of 2018.\nHe stepped back into his usual Friday-night role for the start of 2019.\nBut the Barbe High product missed a schedule start the second weekend of the season at Sam Houston State due to inflammation, and another March 22 against Appalachian State.\nUL associate coach Anthony Babineaux suggested last week that Leger might come out of the pen this at Troy, and he indeed did just that.\n“The next thing we have to decide – and he’ll actually make that decision (based on) how he feels – is what’s his role as a closer in the middle of the week, leading into the weekend?” Robichaux said Monday.\n“Is it weekend to weekend … or can he handle a closer role in a Tuesday or a Wednesday, and then be back up to a closer role on the weekend? Can he close on a Friday night, maybe, and a Sunday also?\nMuch of the decision-making will be left to Leger as the 13-16 Cajuns play midweek games Tuesday night at home against Southeastern Louisiana, Wednesday night against SLU in Hammond for a makeup game and this weekend on M.L. “Tigue” Moore Field at Russo Park for a three-game Sun Belt Conference series that opens up Friday night.\n“He’s gone through pitching healthy. He’s gone through pitching injured,” Robichaux said. “I think he kind of knows both sides of it. I think he knows himself real good.\nLast week, when Leger had just one 15-pitch practice session, Robichaux asked him if he wanted to close Friday night.\nHe opted to wait until Saturday.\nBut the Cajuns didn’t need a closer Saturday, so he was pushed to Sunday.\nWhen Leger started warming up in the eighth inning of what at the time was a tied game, all Robichaux asked was that he give him an honest thumb up or thumb down.\nLeger entered after Hayden Cantrelle doubled in Brennan Breaux to give UL a 4-3 lead, and allowed a single right away, but with a runner at third he got a groundball out to end it.\nAlthough the preference obviously is to start him – Leger has a history of going deep into games when fully healthy, but hasn’t made it past 5.0 innings this year – Robichaux likes the lefty’s maturity and makeup to serve in a closing role.\nEven if it's not one to which he's accustomed.\n“Gunner’s an out-getter,” the Cajuns coach said, “and that’s what makes him good on the back end of the game too.\nSo now Robichaux’s biggest questions become when Leger will go again, how often he can in a week and how soon it will be before he can start extending himself beyond one inning.\nLeger already has put the ball down for a while since the season started, and he’s run through a full course of anti-inflammatory medication too.\nNow it really is mostly a matter of feel.\n“Then you’ve got to take the aftermath of the adrenaline that he put onto his arm in that situation (Sunday),” Robichaux said, “and see ‘how’s his recovery’ now.\nAnd that’s last thing Robichaux wants, especially with the Cajuns now having opened the second half of their season.\nBut until the inflammation is totally gone, the only thing likely is that Leger won’t start again.\n“I think all of it comes back to ‘he’s day-to-day,’ ” Robichaux said. “Maybe it goes from three outs to six outs, then maybe it goes from six outs to nine outs.\nAfter missing two games with a deep muscle bruise sustained",
        "baseline": " when he took a pitch to the shoulder against Appalachian State, usual starting second baseman Hunter Kasuls returned to the Cajuns’ lineup over the weekend. But he played at DH, not second, and according to Robichaux on Monday he still is “slowly starting to come back up to be able to throw the baseball.” … With Kasuls not playing yet in the field, freshman Nathan Camp remained at second and usual designated hitter Todd Lott was moved around to accommodate Kasuls’ return, playing both in left field and at first base. … Lott missed Saturday’s game after, according to Robichaux on Monday, taking a ball on the shin. But he returned to the lineup Sunday, and homered. … Robichaux also said injured catcher Sebastian Toro (elbow) hasn’t swung a bat in around three weeks, and hasn’t thrown a ball to second base yet while still working on his rehab protocol.",

That would make her the latest popular actress said to be up for the role, following one-time candidate Natalie Portman (who is still onboard as a producer) and rumored starlets like Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway.\nZombies would be the latest tentpole project to feature Stone, following in the wake of next summer's The Amazing Spider-Man - which features the actress with her natural blonde locks as classic Peter Parker love interest, Gwen Stacy. Stone will also be showing up briefly this summer in comedies like Friends with Benefits and Crazy, Stupid, Love, and is headlining the pop literary adaptation, The Help.\nAssuming Stone accepts the offer to portray Miss Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the next big move for the horror/romantic literature mashup would be to fill the role of the infamously stuck-up Mr. Darcy in the film. James McAvoy and Bradley Cooper have been rumored as potentials to play the part before - though the latter's increasingly busy schedule (he's attached to star in The Crow reboot and has been circling Paradise Lost recently) seems to discount him as a serious contender.\nUPDATE: Deadline is reporting that Stone has passed on the lead female role in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Expect to hear about another noteworthy actress being approached to play Miss Bennet in the near future.\nOne unexpected tidbit mentioned in Variety's report is that original Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author Seth Grahame-Smith is reportedly penning the screenplay adaptation with Marti Noxon (the scribe behind Gillespie's upcoming Fright Night remake). Gillespie previously indicated that he would be working from a slightly revised version of David O. Russell's script draft, which he described as having \"a great mix of humor and horror\" and loads of action-packed set pieces to boot. In fact, Russell's screenplay was said to be the big thing that kept attracting other filmmakers to the adaptation, after the Fighter helmer left the project last year.\nIt's a shame then to hear that Russell's Zombie screenplay has seemingly been abandoned, especially since it undoubtedly would feature much of his trademark darkly quirky and",
        "baseline": " off-beat humor. On the other hand, Smith's work as a screenwriter has seemingly impressed studio heads up to now - seeing as that he was also trusted with the task of scripting Tim Burton's upcoming Dark Shadows movie and the adaption of his Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter novel for director Timur Bekmambetov. Plus, Noxon definitely has a knack for mixing horror violence with comedy and romance (see: her work on the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series).\nDepending on how well-received Gillespie and Noxon's Fright Night remake is when it hits theaters this summer, anticipation for their Zombies project could either be significantly heightened or lessened. If the horror-comedy goes down well - and Stone does sign on as Miss Bennet - then there's definitely potential for the oddball project to become a very popular title.\nWe'll keep you posted on the status of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies as more information is released.",

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last May that cost-to-income and leverage remain high in Germany.\n\"Low profitability reflects structural inefficiencies, persistent crisis legacy issues, provisions for compliance violations, and the need to adjust to the new regulatory environment,\" the IMF said in the report last May.\nAnother problem seems to be the reliance on the shipping industry for many banks.\n\"I would point towards some specific issues with asset quality: Shipping is one of the priorities of the single supervisor, the ECB (European Central Bank), for next year,\" Gildas Surry, senior analyst at Axiom Alternative Investments, told CNBC on Wednesday when citing the biggest problem for the German banking sector.\nLoaning to the shipping industry before the financial crisis was a stable investment, however, the industry has become shaky and the long-term loans became a problem for many institutions dependent on this sector.\nHSH Nordbank, for instance, once the biggest shipping lender in the world, had to be rescued by two German states in 2009.

No, not a topic which will win elections,\" Brzeski said.\nGerman officials have nonetheless focused on the European Central Bank and its loose monetary policy as being the major drag on the German banking system.\nWolfgang Schaeuble, the German Finance minister, has said on a few occasions that the ECB needs to tighten its policy, which is also leading to an increase in Germany's export surplus.\n\"Lower and flatter yield curves are compounding these issues by gradually eroding margins, especially in smaller retail banks,\" the IMF recognized last May.",

        "prompt": "Atlantic City's bright lights can't overshadow a dark financial picture.\nUncertainty has always been a way of life for casinos who make their money on games of chance. But now, Atlantic City casinos are looking at their own futures with uncertainty.\nDonald Trump quit as chairman of the casino company he once ran, and wants his name off the three casinos that have been synonymous with Atlantic City for decades, now that they're in bankruptcy for the third time.\nThe Tropicana Casino and Resort will file for bankruptcy next month, and Resorts Atlantic City -- the first casino in New Jersey -- could also become the first to be foreclosed on.\nSince gambling was legalized here nearly 31 years ago, never has the country's second-largest casino market gone through this turbulent a time.\nIn addition to the economic slump, which leaves people with less money to gamble, Atlantic City's 11 casinos are being battered by fierce competition from slots parlors in Pennsylvania and New York.\nThose gambling halls are attracting people who recently had no choice but to come here unless they wanted to get on a plane to Las Vegas, or drive to faraway casinos in other states.\nLast year, gambling revenue at Atlantic City's casinos fell 7.6 percent. The year before that, it was down 5.7 percent.\nAbout 2,700 fewer people are now working in Atlantic City casinos than were employed a year ago. That's a 7 percent decline, and additional layoffs are being threatened.\n“None of us could have predicted two years ago the way the world is now,'' said Nicholas Ribis, co-owner of Resorts, which is among the worst-performing casinos in Atlantic City. “I'm not saying this town is going to be back where it was two years ago. I wish it was.\n“It's tough to get people to come,'' he said.\nResorts became the first casino outside Las Vegas when it opened in May 1978. But it remains one of the smallest gambling halls in town, and has not kept pace with newer, hipper casinos like the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa.\nResorts' parent company, an affiliate of Los Angeles-based Colony Capital, stopped making payments on a loan in November, saying they just couldn't afford it.\nThat prompted the lender, Column Financial, to ask the casino commission for permission to foreclose on Resorts. A decision could come in two weeks.\nRibis said taking out the $360 million mortgage was a mistake in hindsight.\nResorts is not even able to say when it might be able to resume making loan payments. The casino's 2009 budget does not include them.\nThe Tropicana is expected to file for bankruptcy in late March, 14 months after its former owners were stripped of their casino license after laying off nearly 1,000 workers. That led to problems with cleanliness, service and compliance with state casino regulations.\nBaltimore-based Cordish Company had been selected as a potential purchaser by the state-appointed conservator overseeing the Tropicana since then. But a deal has yet to be struck, and now a group including billionaire financier Carl Icahn may make a bid for the casino,according to his lawyer.\nStill more uncertainty surrounds the three casinos owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, and were notified on Friday that their stock would be delisted from the NASDAQ exchange on Feb. 26. Its three casinos have now been through Chapter 11 three times as they seek some relief from debt that has suffocated the company as it tries to compete in Atlantic City.\nTrump quit earlier this month after bond holders who hold an edge on the company's board of directors rebuffed his offer to buy the",
        "baseline": " company and take it private.\nIt is far from assured that Trump will go quietly. As the holder of 28 percent of the company's stock -- even though he calls it “worthless to me now'' -- Trump will still be in a position to influence the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings.\nTrump points out that the casinos represent “substantially less than 1 percent of my net worth,'' which is mainly based in real estate.\nFor now, his name will stay on the three casinos under a 10-year agreement with the company that gives it the right to use the Trump name. Trump says he may sue to break that agreement.\nThe casinos plan to operate normally during the bankruptcy proceeding, even as questions swirl over whether Trump Entertainment will be able to complete a planned sale of Trump Marina Hotel Casino to Coastal Marina LLC, a company run by a former protege of Donald Trump.\nDespite all the gloom, Ribis says Resorts -- and Atlantic City -- will survive.",

Hackers penetrated networks at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, gaining access to employee records at the FBI and other agencies. Hundreds of gigabytes worth of data have been stolen, the hackers claim, and they are using the hack as a protest for the #FreePalestine movement.\nA hacker, who wishes to remain anonymous, plans to dump the apparent names, job titles, email addresses and phone numbers of over 20,000 supposed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employees, as well as over 9,000 alleged Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees, Motherboard has learned.\nThe hacker also claims to have downloaded hundreds of gigabytes of data from a Department of Justice (DOJ) computer, although that data has not been published.\nOn Sunday, Motherboard obtained the supposedly soon-to-be-leaked data and called a large selection of random numbers in both the DHS and FBI databases. Many of the calls went through to their respective voicemail boxes, and the names for their supposed owners matched with those in the database. At one point, Motherboard reached the operations center of the FBI, according to the person on the other end.\nOne alleged FBI intelligence analyst did pick up the phone, and identified herself as the same name as listed in the database. A DHS employee did the same, but did not feel comfortable confirming his job title, he said.\nMeanwhile, a twitter account under the handle @DotGovs appears to be host to the hackers responsible for the breach. On the profile, which has stated publicly that it has multiple admins, the hackers threatened to expose a separate set of up to 20,000 credentials from the FBI – however this data has not yet been published.\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said it did not think the hackers had managed to release “sensitive, personally-identifiable information”, and that if it discovered criminal activity it would press charges.\n“The department is looking into the unauthorised access of a system operated by one of its components containing employee contact information,” he told The Telegraph.\n“This unauthorised access is still under investigation; however, there is no indication at this time that there is any breach of sensitive personally identifiable information.\nAn FBI source told Newsweek that some FBI employees were notified in May that their files had been accessed by hackers during the massive year-long breach of OPM’s database.\nMore than 36,000 people currently work for the FBI, and while it remains unclear how many of them were affected by the alleged hack, the cyber security breach by the unnamed hacker can have “mind-boggling” effects, according",
        "baseline": " to the sources, because there can be several classified data [sic].\nPerhaps this is a separate attack from the one in May, but if so, that makes it even worse. Besides, these agencies supposedly began hardening their data security after the OPM hack got exposed in June of last year. If this penetration took place before federal officials took notice of the China-based penetration of the federal employee and security clearance databases, then it raises questions about who else might have been able to grab that highly sensitive information. If it took place afterward — and there seems to be little reason for hacktivists to keep quiet about this information for as long as eight months or more — then it raises even more questions about the response to the massive security breach last year.\nThe FBI will need to get to the bottom of this hack quickly. And Congress should start demanding answers on cybersecurity from an administration that has lectured the private sector on this issue endlessly but seems incapable of taking their own advice.",

I saw more low-slung two-seaters tooling around downtown during a ten-day visit last month than I see here in a year. It’s not just sports cars, but hand-built, limited edition models. One of the most popular sections of the huge British International Motor Show I attended in Birmingham two weeks ago was of cars most of us never heard of. Some aren’t even on the streets yet.\nTrident made its worldwide introduction at the show. It’s a small company with a big racing heritage, founded by Eric Broadley, who previously founded the Lola Formula One racing team. He designed the chassis for this new vroomer. Seats do not move forward or back to accommodate differently sized drivers. They are in a fixed position, designed to perfectly balance the car. What adjusts instead are gas and brake pedals and steering wheel.\nMarketing manager Kelly Bevan, a former race driver herself, told me Trident would love to export to the US, but, there are no such plans at the moment. The vehicle does not have a single straight line on it, which means no bumpers, which means it cannot pass US bumper crash-test regulations.\nThere’s a convertible and a hardtop with removable Targa-type windows that stow in the trunk, which is larger than most sports car trunks. Trident has been described as a mini-Viper because of its power and a female-friendly Corvette because of its styling. They hope to produce 250 vehicles next year, and at an affordable $50,000, they probably will sell out.\nAnother start-up is Parradine, which plans to make only 50 a year of its front-engine, rear-wheel drive 525hp (yes, 525 hp) V8. Plan on spending $175,000 for this baby, which has mini video cameras instead of conventional side-view mirrors, and provides live moving picture on the dashboard of what_s happening behind and around you. Parradine also hopes",

Another manufacturer, Ronart, uses carbon fiber, the same lightweight material as used in Grand Prix cars, for its convertibles. Another favorite were the brawny models from TVR, which makes both four-seater hard-tops and two-seater convertibles, with styling reminiscent of Porsche.\nThe Aero 8 is a radical departure from the traditional design _ an aluminum chassis and rounded fenders that reminded me of the voluptuous French cars of the forties, specifically the 47 Delahaye.",

By helping investors create jobs in Africa and Asia we will help lift millions out of poverty.\nShe recommends the projects backed by the Global Goals organisation. Back in 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals including no poverty and gender equality by 2030.\nShe said: “We want to give British savers a chance to make a financial return in exchange for their goodwill to change the world for the better.\n“I want people to have more information about how their savings are used and the opportunities available to them to invest in things that they care about.\nBritain currently spends 0.7 per cent of its GDP on foreign aid which counts for around £14 billion.\nAs we prepare to leave the EU it is a good time to take stock of what we do on the global stage, and that includes what we do with UK aid.\nThe British people are generous and care about the plight of others suffering in all corners of the globe.\nI know this because whenever there is an emergency appeal in the wake of a disaster the public donates millions to save lives and protect the vulnerable.\nI know this because my mail bag is full of people asking me to ensure girls everywhere can get an education, or telling me to combat killer diseases like malaria, polio or AIDS. Having been an aid worker myself, I know the power of aid.\nWe are a nation that has made a commitment to spending 0.7% of our national income on international development. But despite the public’s pride in much of this work, they are concerned about the amount we spend when compared to their priorities at home.\nThese are not selfish concerns. They still care about people across the globe, but they want their fellow citizens to have the support and care they need too.\nWe should also recognise that although UK aid does some amazing work, continuing as we are is not going to deliver all we need to achieve a target to end extreme poverty by 2030. So what can we do about both those concerns?\nHow can we have the impact we want to help people around the world? First, we must maximise the good we do with what money we have.\nWe must demonstrate that the money we are spending could not have been spent better in interest of the people we are trying to help and in the national interest.\nAnd often that means ensuring we get a double win – both a great impact for developing nations but also a direct positive result for the UK too. Secondly, the UK is working to modernise",
        "baseline": " international aid rules. We should make sure we get the most out of the 0.7%.\nIn future years, as the amount of funding coming back into our own development financial instruments—publicly owned financial instruments—increases, we should be open to using the profits to count towards the 0.7%. Thirdly, public money should be reserved for what only it can fund.\nBy helping investors create jobs in Africa and Asia we will help lift millions out of poverty.\nSuch investment funds could also create opportunities for British savers and pensioners to earn a return and do good in the world: another win-win. Finally, we must not solely rely on hardworking people’s taxes to fund good projects.\nWe should always try to find corporate or philanthropic co-funders for the projects we think will make a difference.

It was only after the committee publicized details about Newbold’s testimony Monday, Cummings said, that Kline agreed to come before lawmakers voluntarily.\nKline has said he will not answer questions about specific security-clearance decisions, Cummings said.\nCummings denied that the subpoena is politically motivated.\nRepublicans on the committee objected to Democrats’ handling of Newbold’s interview, which took place on March 23, a Saturday. Representative Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said lawmakers were out of town on a recess and only learned about the interview the day before it took place.\nCummings said they scheduled the hearing at short notice because Newbold was afraid the White House would retaliate against her for coming forward.\nThe second set of subpoenas authorized Tuesday involve the proposed addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\nWhile Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross claimed that the citizenship question was added at the request of the Justice Department, federal judges in New York and California have ruled that Ross’ conduct appears pretextual.\nGroups opposed to the change in the once-in-a-decade census contend that a citizenship question is specifically geared at undercounting minorities, who tend to vote Democrat.\nIn addition to testimony from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, the subpoenas seek documents",

Voicing disappointment with the vote on subpoenas today meanwhile, the department released a statement from Secretary Ross.\nThe House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",

        "prompt": "It’s a job Brennan has been doing for years—as the president’s counter-terrorism adviser, he designed, expanded, and secured drones as one of the C.I.A.’s chief tools. At the helm of the agency it will be Brennan who either secures drones as a part of the C.I.A. policy or eradicates them, entrenching or limiting the C.I.A.’s increasingly paramilitary operations, according to experts.\nThe C.I.A’s program is the most criticized and shrouded part of the U.S.’s counter-terrorism strategy. Unlike the military’s drones, C.I.A. drones operate far from battlefields and in countries where we aren’t at war. Reports show morphing criteria as to who and what merits a drone attack. Critics slam the program for killing civilians, setting shaky legal precedent, and creating anti-American sentiment all over the world. Brennan, the program’s architect and chief spokesman, has denied these things.\nBrennan “helped to oversee the vast expansion of a secretive and illegal targeted killing program in which thousands of people have died with little transparency, including many hundreds of innocent bystanders,” the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Director Hina Shamsi said to msnbc.com.\nThe program has even been criticized by retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who saw some of the first drones pioneered under the military’s program, in Afghanistan.\nUnder the advisement of Brennan—whose critics have dubbed him the “assassination czar”— the CIA was authorized to operate its own armed aircraft off a new base in the Middle East.\nHowever, Brennan also reportedly worked to limit the kill lists of targets the C.I.A. is authorized to strike against, and the number of drone attacks. A Washington Post series in December quoted many of Brennan’s associates, who anonymously indicated that Brennan worked to be a check and balance to the program, so much so that the C.I.A. considers Brennan “a rein, a constrainer. He is using his intimate knowledge of intelligence and the process to pick apart their arguments that might be expansionary,” a senior official outside the White House told the Post.\nBrennan’s nomination is largely expected to receive an easy approval in the Senate, unlike former Sen. Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be Secretary of Defense, which has already been criticized by Republicans.\nMany of the drone program’s critics say that it has exacerbated the instability of regions and hurt America’s fight against terrorists.\nGreg Johnsen, author of the “The Last Refuge: Yemen, Al-Qaeda, and America’s War in Arabia,” and an expert on Yemen, sees a direct correlation from the drone program to the rise of Al Qaeda in the region.\nJohnsen authored an op-ed in November in The New York Times entitled, “The Wrong Man for the CIA,” where he argues that putting Brennan at the helm of the organization will continue the militarization of the organization through the drone program. “It’s not actually solving the problem, it’s making it worse. A contention of that will have quite dire repercussions for American national security,” he said. “There’s nothing I’ve seen in the past four years that leads to me to suggest that Brennan will do anything differently in the C.I.A.,” Johnsen added.\nJohnsen’s work is concentrated on Yemen, where the Obama administration has launched many attacks. Brennan praised the program’s success in the region in an October interview with the Post: “there are aspects of the Yemen program that I think are a true model of what I think the U.S. counter-terrorism community should be doing” as it tracks the spread of al-Qaeda allies across Northern Africa.\nA recent investigative report from the British Bureau of Investigative Journalism, concluded the civilian costs to be higher, finding at least 392 deaths (including 175 children) since 2004, more than a thousand civilian injuries over that period of time, and that at least 45 Pakistani civilians were killed in 10 strikes spanning a year. The report also found that most combatants killed were low-ranking militants, also likely leading to resentment",
        "baseline": " among non-combatant populations. In a November strike that killed a Yemeni militant, family and friends reported the target was a low-level ally of Al-Qaeda and questioned why he wasn’t taken alive.\nIn the Senate hearing, Shamsi said there is opportunity to rein in the drone program in a away Congress has never had. “The Senate needs to look at [drones] before moving forward with this nomination,” she said.\nSo far, the only indication of a potential hitch in Brennan’s nomination has been unrelated to drones or any part of Brennan’s record on counter-terrorism. On Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested holding up the CIA nomination as leverage in his questions for more information on the attack against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\nThe White House declined to comment further on Brennan and the drones program other than to reference one of the aforementioned speeches by Brennan on drones.",

A proper map could help us answer this question.\nAnd a map scientists are making. A team of researchers in Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States have presented a new map that records galaxies deep into the distance of a small swath of sky. They revealed a sample of 4,000 galaxies.\nHere’s an image of their map, below. Each of the galaxies is plotted by its redshift, meaning how fast it is receding away from us—more distant light appears redder to us because its wavelength has been stretched by the expansion of the universe. The closest galaxies are in blue, since blue has a shorter wavelength. Even though the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, you’ll notice that the light has traveled billions of light-years more than that—another effect of our expanding universe.\nThe map, from nearer (blue) to farther (red) galaxies.\nThis survey specifically uses the COSMOS field, perhaps one of the most widely studied areas in the sky outside of the Milky Way, according to the paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. This data included observations from x-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, optical, and radio waves.\nSpecifically, the study looks at the “Lyman alpha line”—light emitted when an electron in hydrogen atoms jumps from an excited state to a ground state. This light is usually the ultraviolet kind, much of which can’t be detected on Earth since our ozone layer blocks most of it. But the expanding universe stretches the light so it becomes visible to ground-based telescopes, like the Subaru telescope in Hawaii. By looking at it through different filters, they can spot galaxies of specific wavelengths, and therefore specific ages.\nThe team’s analysis reveals 4,",
        "baseline": "000 of these Lyman-alpha emitters—that’s 4,000 potential galaxies around 19 billion to 28 billion light-years away.\nThe team’s still doing spectroscopy (seeing what other colors the galaxies emit to see what elements they contain) and how they are moving. But ultimately, tools like these could be plenty useful to astronomers to try and understand how galaxies like ours evolve over time. The astronomers also see changes in the light emitted between these galaxies, implying changes in how active they are. Additionally, the galaxies are much more compact than our own, implying that our galaxy, too, could have once been much smaller.\nBright x-ray emitting galaxies in the data, called active galactic nuclei, could also help astronomers understand how density varies throughout the universe.\nThe data is now public. So maybe you can take a look and try to understand how galaxies evolved over time, and perhaps one day we will figure out how our own got here.",

He pointed out, however, that even companies that support open source are just as motivated by commercial interests as any other commercial software vendor. He noted that even open source giants Red Hat and IBM are after a return on their investments on open source.\n\"They are not for the greater good of the community; they are also after the money,\" he said.\nHe added that without getting back any commercial returns, a software company will find it difficult to invest in developing new software products. He explained that intellectual property rights fuel sustained innovation by a software company.\nMicrosoft, for example, invests around US$6.8 billion in research and development. \"With open source, there is no way to make more software,\" he said.\nSharp claimed that many",

In many cases, he said, it's just one branch or agency of the government making the announcement, and it is not a government-wide purchasing policy.\nHe urged government bodies to base their software purchasing decisions on their actual needs, not on a software development strategy.\nIn one study, he said commercial software offered lower total cost of ownership over open source software, largely due to software management issues. He added that commercial software has also been found to be as reliable as open source software.\nIf a government goes out and anchors its purchasing policy on open source, it will, in effect. hurt its local commercial software community, Sharp claimed. For every $1 spent on Microsoft products, for example, some $8 goes to the surrounding local software community who have based their products on Microsoft technologies, he said.\n\"There are many local software vendors who have based their products on Microsoft,\" he added.",

As well as the rise of men having beards, and disruptive subscription razor services, Gillette has spent the last decade bogged down in a willy-waving facial arms race with Wilkinson Sword to see who can pack the most blades and mechanical gizmos into its razors.\nHowever, Gillette is now appealing to more sensitive customers with its adverts, and more sensitive skin with its new razor, aptly named SkinGuard Sensitive. We've been using one for the last month, and we are seriously impressed.\nAs you can see, there a few obvious differences between this and previous Gillette razors. There's only two blades, and they're separated by a 'SkinGuard bar'.\nThe other obvious change is that the lubricating strip usually found on Gillette and other razors is now a lubricating rectangle, positioned above and below the blade array.\nA third of British men consider themselves to have sensitive skin, but even if you don't, the SkinGuard Sensitive undoubtedly gives a very comfortable shave.\nTo this end, the pair of sharp blades are coated for 'low cutting force', and positioned so that hair is only pulled and cut twice in each stroke, reducing tug and pull.\nThe result is",

The design does slightly resemble a body shaver, and it is indeed excellent for manscaping, removal of bodily hair you don't want and 'tidying your downstairs'.\nHowever, we would not recommend trying to shave a week's worth of beard with this, as you'll be there for hours. We tried just this on one occasion, so we know what we're talking about.\nIt's also important to store this razor somewhere dry, or that over-sized lube-strip will degrade rapidly.

        "prompt": "ELIOT JANEWAY's new book smacks of an earlier era when many economists were even less precise than today. He doesn't seem to belong to any school of economics - monetarist, neo-Keynesian, structuralist, or whatever. As a result, it is difficult to find a logical economic pattern in this book.\n''Prescriptions for Prosperity'' is often fuzzy in its analysis. There is none of the numbers-crunching of his younger economic colleagues, no careful economic theorizing. Perhaps that's why he calls himself a ''political economist.'' The words, suggestions, and opinions just flow and flow as Janeway rambles through a look back at economic affairs during the years from President Johnson to President Reagan.\nPerhaps this stems from his background as an investment-letter writer (The Janeway Letter). Most such letter writers state firm opinions on where the market is going and what stocks or other investments to buy. Whether wrong or right, they exude an air of certainty because investors want firm, not wishy-washy, advice.\nMr. Janeway avoids the need for registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser by not making recommendations on specific stocks or bonds or commodity investments. This makes it difficult to measure his track record as an investment adviser. But he is firm in the third and last section of this book about how one should divide a portfolio between general classes of investments, such as gas and oil debentures, low-grade, high-leverage gold stocks, high-technology defense stocks, etc., in either hard times or transitional times. (From what Mr. Janeway says, I suspect he figures the United States is on its way to hard times.) The reader will have to pick specific investments himself.\nA second element in this book (and Mr. Janeway's other writings) is a fecundity of ideas - policy suggestions, novel ways of looking at the political economic scene, fresh interpretations of events, and so on. It makes for somewhat entertaining reading. There may be useful ideas, but some of the ideas are rather wild and others, shall we say, questionable.\nWell, first of all, how much high interest rates result from large deficits has been a matter of considerable debate in Washington lately. But, assuming that's right, the OPEC nations as a group no longer have a balance-of-payments surplus, but a deficit. Even Saudi Arabia ran in the red last year. Janeway suggests Arab central banks would buy these so-called ''zero-coupon bonds'' issued by the US Treasury in exchange for the guarantee of American",
        "baseline": " protection. I doubt proud, sovereign Arab nations would accept such a deal, especially since the US is the prime ally of Israel.\nAnother of his recommendations would seem to have a greater chance of acceptance. Banks and other mortgage-issuing institutions, he says, should offer second mortgages on which only interest is paid - not the principal. Swiss financial institutions have offered perpetual mortgages for many years in that capital-rich nation. The US does not usually have such a capital surplus. But at the moment housing is doing well with other new types of lending, such as variable-rate mortgages.\nHis analysis is more sophisticated than that of the common doomsayer. He knows modern history, has had considerable contacts at various times with White House insiders (including presidents), and has a good memory for appropriate quotations, aphorisms, and anecdotes. But in a way, that sophistication makes his book more dangerous. Read it with caution - and take his advice with more than a single grain of salt.",
        "llm_baseline": "military protection.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.But the US Treasury would have to pay a higher interest rate on these bonds than on the bonds it issues to the public.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.But the US Treasury would have to pay a higher interest rate on these bonds than on the bonds it issues to the public.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.But the US Treasury would have to pay a higher interest rate on these bonds than on the bonds it issues to the public.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.But the US Treasury would have to pay a higher interest rate on these bonds than on the bonds it issues to the public.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.But the US Treasury would have to pay a higher interest rate on these bonds than on the bonds it issues to the public.This would be a way of financing the deficit without raising taxes.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

And now the company is finally going to do something about that: Google announced this morning that it will no longer support the Picasa desktop application as of March 16, 2016. In addition, it will be archiving Picasa Web Albums data at a later date while encouraging those users to convert to Google Photos instead.\nIt’s clear that Google is concerned about backlash from its devoted user base who still relies on Picasa, given the tone of today’s announcement. The company emphasized how much time it has invested in making sure it makes the transition as painless as possible for end users.\n“We know for many of you, a great deal of care has gone into managing your photos and videos using Picasa—including the hours you’ve invested and the most precious moments you’ve trusted us with,” writes Anil Sabharwal, Head of Google Photos on a blog post. “So we will take some time in order to do this right and provide you with options and easy ways to access your content,” he added.\nFor those who are using the Picasa desktop application, it will continue to work as it does today – and if you choose to download it before the shutdown date of March 16, that will also be the case. However, the software will no longer receive future updates.\nTo be fair, the software hadn’t been updated much as it was – the desktop app may have received minor tweaks, security patches and bug fixes, but its overall user interface is incredibly dated. It looks much like it did years ago.\nFor those who want to make the switch to Google Photos, there’s a desktop uploader app available at photos.google.com/apps that can be used going forward.\nMeanwhile, there’s likely more concern from users about the data collected on Picasa Web Albums, which includes very specific metadata about their photos. Specifically, users may have tagged their photos for organizational purposes, as well as added captions. Friends and family may have commented on some photos, as well. It doesn’t sound like that metadata has made the transition to Google Photos, however.\nGoogle notes that the easiest way to access, modify and share the content from a Picasa Web Album is to log into Google Photos, as photos and videos will already be there for you, automatically.\nThere aren’t a lot of details about this new place yet, except that it will offer users tools to “view, download, or delete�",

        "prompt": "Shame on the Gazette for casting aspersions on the motivations of longtime civic leaders Mary Ellen McNally and Ann Oatman-Gardner in last Sunday's spiteful editorial (\"D-11 recall backers have suspect motives,\" Metro, p. 8).\nInstead of focusing on relevant issues, the Gazette resorted to cheap ad hominem attacks, calling those seeking to recall D-11 school board members Sandy Shakes and Eric Christen \"union apparatchiks\" and \"left-wing activists.\"\nAbout the only thing the Gazette's editorial got right is that McNally and Oatman-Gardner are \"no ordinary citizens.\" Unlike the recent arrivals to our community who control the Gazette's editorial page, these two women not only have a long history of actively serving our fast-changing and complex community, but also have spent countless hours volunteering in D-11.\nLet's start with McNally, a former school teacher, D-11 school board member (1981-85) and Colorado Springs city councilwoman (1985-89). McNally has been civically engaged in our community for more than four decades. She knows what she is talking about, having served on dozens of community boards, ranging from those of the American National Bank to the Pikes Peak Chapter of the American Red Cross; from Cheyenne Village to the Colorado Springs Sports Corporation; from the Memorial Hospital Foundation to the Edison Charter School, where she is a trustee.\nIf you enjoy living in our community, then thank McNally, along with a handful of other notable women including Nancy Lewis, Kathy Loo, Marcy Morrison, Mary Lou Makepeace and Ann Oatman-Gardner.\nAmong other accomplishments, Oatman-Gardner served as campaign manager for the first successful Trails Open Space and Parks (TOPS) ballot initiative a measure the Gazette editorialized against 21 times. She also served as campaign manager for Richard Skorman's successful run for City Council and has been active in a host of other civic endeavors, including helping develop a public-private partnership to build a much-needed park at D-11's Taylor Elementary School.\nThe Gazette editorial team is just plain pathetic when it states that McNally and Oatman-Gardner do not have \"a sincere concern for students.\" Compare McNally and Oatman-Gardner's combined 70-plus-year track record of service to our community with those of the Gazette's editorial page editor Sean Paige, and Paige's boss, publisher Bob Burdick, neither of whom has been in our community for more than four years.\nA recall of elected officials should be a course of last resort. But let's face facts. Our dysfunctional D-11 school board has wasted millions of dollars. Far more importantly, it has reduced the educational opportunities for 30,000-plus students.\nRecall target Sandy Shakes not only encouraged Sharon Thomas to apply for the D-11 superintendent position, but also actively championed her hiring during the six-month selection process. As then-chair of the school board, Shakes cast the deciding vote to hire Thomas. A year later, Shakes cast the deciding vote to fire her. Shakes also endorsed the large severance package that Thomas understandably sought before agreeing to relocate from Minnesota to take a job offered by a very divided and divisive school board.\nShakes has also undertaken a variety of questionable actions. For example, in March, she proposed to the district that it retain her recently formed company to start a teacher-training program. When questioned about the ethics of such a proposition, Shakes stated that she would be willing to resign her board seat if awarded the contract. Such convoluted actions create the appearance of significant conflict of interest. Shakes also serves as a per diem sales consultant for Prentice Hall, while the schoolbook publisher actively seeks business from D-11.\nThe other recall target is Eric Christen, an ideologue and bully. With the backing of wealthy voucher supporters, Christen gained a seat on the D-11 school board in 2003, shortly after moving to Colorado Springs.\nWithin six months of his election, Christen wrote to his supporters that \"this district [D-11] can expect a guerilla warfare campaign unlike anything they have ever seen by those who are exceedingly proficient at it.\"\nChristen supports the demise of public education. He has even signed an online pledge with the California-based organization Alliance for the Separation of School & State that reads, \"I proclaim publicly that I favor ending government involvement in education.\" The other volunteers serving on the D-11 board will never succeed with one board member actively employing \"guerilla warfare tactics\" to intentionally format discord.\nChristen, who has served probation due to a road-rage incident in Oregon, uses his bully pulpit to intentionally foment discord. He also has been a plain, outright bully.\nTo cite just one of numerous examples, on Election Day 2004, Christen planted campaign signs in the North Middle School grounds, a clear violation of D-11 policy. When asked to remove the signs, Christen threatened to have the employee making the request terminated. The D-11 board has issued a formal reprimand of Christen, citing, among other things, his behavior that day.\nSo long as the two most dysfunctional board members continue to control the balance of power in the Pikes Peak region's largest school district, there is no hope in sight. It is time for the community to stand up to wealthy ideologues hellbent on promoting vouchers no matter what the consequences.\nWaiting for the next regular election means that D-11 will remain in chaos until new board members are empowered in early 2008. Our children deserve better. We must act swiftly to re-establish stability in the leadership that controls the educational opportunities of more than 30,000 local children.\nWho writes the Gazette's editorials?\na columnist for the Washington Times, the conservative daily owned by the Rev.

Prior to that the Galaxy S3, S2 and S1 handsets were not released until May/June, before Samsung (wisely) decided to put more time between its flagship phones and Apple’s annual iPhone update.\nAs such I’d say this news is actually a good thing. Yes, technically it is a delay but it also shows Samsung is not prepared to rush the Galaxy S8 to market - something the company admits it did with the Galaxy Note 7 to great cost.",

To maintain interest in Lindt's other ongoing key products, including its Swiss Tradition box assortments.\nIn the past, Lindt has promoted its seasonal range with press kits and product shots taken from its sales brochure. This year, however, to reflect the premium quality of the Lindor brand, Jane Park PR invested in lifestyle photography of the Valentine's Day collection, taken by interiors specialist Lindsey Stock.\nThe photographs were incorporated into press packs for both the consumer and trade media, while the PR team set up a telephone hotline for journalists to receive samples within a 48-hour delivery time frame.\nThe photography was then pushed forwards for use in mini advertorials in publications including",

Consumer coverage ranged from The Daily Mail and Hello! to Bella, the Somerfield Magazine and websites such as handbag.com. The story was also carried by the trade media, including Retail Newsagent, Asian Trader and Multiple Buyer & Retailer.\nThe visuals gained extensive interest from regional titles, including the Yorkshire Evening Press, which ran a promotion offering readers free bags of Lindor.\nSales of Lindt's Valentine's Day range increased by 266 per cent from 1 January to 22 February, compared to the same period last year.",

        "prompt": "Technology has always played a profound, ­shadowy supporting role in how we hear music. It was the brief length of the first commercially ­manufactured gramophone records that defined the still-­standard length of the three-minute pop song. Later, seven-inch singles gave birth to the culture of ­jukeboxes, ­incentivising immediate choice in a way that might be considered a precursor to ­today’s streaming revolution.\nIn the 1950s, the advent of LPs allowed the album to ­develop as an art form – a ­40-ish minute suite to fit a 12-inch record – while cassette tapes spawned the homegrown mixtape culture in the 1980s. CDs brought more ­convenience and a longer ­runtime, presaging ­recorded music’s sales peak during the 1990s.\nIn the early 2000s, the invention of the iPod swept that all aside, and gave birth to what we might call the “Age of Shuffle”. No longer restricted to a single recorded source – or, at best, a clumsy six-disc CD changer – listeners were suddenly free to draw from endless sequential variations of their favourite tunes, at whim or at ­random. The album was pronounced dead, only somewhat ­prematurely.\nAnd now, as streaming ­services unleash us from the ­burdens of making any choice at all, beyond a loosely defined “mood”, we enter the “Age of the Playlist”.\nLike an almighty, time-­travelling jukebox, streaming services’ greatest USPs are promoting possibility. Platforms such as Anghami, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal each stock between 20 and 50 million songs – allowing users to explore unknown genres, eras and continents with a single swipe. The listener has never had so much choice.\nThe problem, as some see it, is that most people don’t know what to do with this newfound freedom, a ­conundrum that has given birth to the lazy listening fall-back: the playlist. The fact that numerous niche and unsigned artists have enjoyed overnight success after being dropped into one of Spotify’s everyman playlists proves just how many are choosing to forgo making a selection – and the shadowy career-making power that sits with a few ­“expert curators” at Spotify HQ.\nBut beyond anointing ­tomorrow’s stars, crippling record ­c­ompanies and dulling attention spans, streaming culture has also given a fresh rise to ­another curious musical trend: mood music. The most popular playlists are not those that conform to a strict genre – not Jazztronica, or Death & Grind Classics – but those grasping after a more nebulous organising principle. Among the best-followed selections on Spotify today are the vagaries of Your ­Favourite Coffeehouse, Have a Great Day! and Songs to Sing in the Shower – playlists that serve up satisfyingly safe background music to ­growing ranks of listeners who in previous eras might ­simply have switched on the radio.\nAn even ­stranger twist on this trend is the ­functional playlist, or Music to Do Other Things To.\nIn decades past, tunes curated to serve a ­particular environment or mood – “lift music”, or “dinner table jazz” – were generally frowned upon as lowbrow and inferior. The kind of numbing electronic dance music that remains a gym mainstay has long been a source of derision for serious listeners.\nBut today the internet is awash with ready-made mixes designed to suit external activities, for audiences with little time for the music itself. Particularly popular are ­productivity-inspiring ­collections such as “Focus music”, “Brain Food” and “Music to do ­homework to”.\nThe trend is only likely to increase in this country since November’s regional launch of Spotify. The world’s most successful ­streaming app has enjoyed a tenfold increase in the number of users over the past five years and now boasts 87 million paid subscribers and 191 million overall users.\nThe market-leading monolith is inspiring this cultural shift in how we approach music, employing experts to curate ideal playlists to accompany activities, from running to relaxing, and from romance to road trips.\nBut ready-made soundtracks cherrypicked by ­professionals – or, heaven forbid, an algorithm – suggest a muso-­troubling brand of disinterest in the origins or intent of the music itself. Today you don’t need to know the name of the song, where the singer came from, or even what genre you are listening to.\nIn the same way that the seven-inch record gave birth to the single, and the LP defined the album format, ­streaming culture is now having a profound effect on today’s music-makers and facilitators. Musicians write with swipes rather than airplay in mind, and record labels pull favours for slots on lucrative playlists. But, conversely, offline ­musicians are pursuing this activity accompanying idea in ways that might have proved less palatable to listeners before the sudden sea change. Later this month, eclectic turntablist Kid Koala ­releases Music to Draw To: Io, his second album aimed at giving graphic artists and bedroom sketchers an ideally inspirational soundtrack.\nReleased in 2015, ­contemporary composer Max Richter’s Sleep – an eight-hour “lullaby for our frenetic world” composed in ­consultation with a neurologist – has shipped 100,000 copies and inspired overnight sleep-in, ­pyjama-clad concerts.\nAs the activity you do at the same time eclipses the music itself, some fear a dilution in artistry.

The regulator can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's China revenues for the previous year.\nThe Xinhua report said the cost of replacing all the spare parts in a Mercedes-Benz C-Class could be 12 times more than buying a new vehicle, citing a report from the China Automotive Maintenance and Repair Trade Association.\nYes, and if you individually buy all the parts for a MacBook Air do you know how expensive that would be?\nThis is a curious case and I can't quite figure it out. A woman says she suffered \"third-degree\" burns because the seat heaters in a Chevy Suburban she was in were too hot.\nThis sounds scurrilous, but the woman is paralyzed and had no feeling there. GM denied that the heater was defective or this was even possible. I have no strong opinions other way, but I'm curious.\nIn what manages to be good PR, good legal advice, and just good corporate leadership Mary Barra has sent letters to most of the owners of cars in the ignition recall urging them to get their cars fixed.\nOne letter went to more than 1 million owners who had not ordered parts through their dealer or online. A second went to about 875,000 owners who had placed parts order, but hadn't gotten cars fixed. Letters included information",

        "prompt": "Creative Displays & Designs in Tinton Falls has turned to Shiloh, the office bunny rabbit whose steady, calm demeanor has provided a morale boost.\nTINTON FALLS - Shiloh, the lionhead rabbit with a mane of gray hair and pointy ears, really doesn't need any help looking cute, but Jannah Mahmoud, his unofficial keeper, can't resist.\nOnce, the ecommerce and marketing manager for Creative Displays & Designs placed a half-eaten carrot on Shiloh's head, snapped a picture, and texted it to Heather Perry, who sat just a few feet away. Another time, it was a string bean.\n“I’ve been sending them to Heather, our general manager, just for no reason,” Mahmoud, 22, said sheepishly.\nShiloh has become a mascot and source of stress relief for Creative Displays, a company with 40 employees that makes decorative accessories and sells to designers and businesses. He sits on Mahmoud's desk. And her lap. And he occasionally will retrieve her pen, like a dog chasing a tennis ball that isn't thrown very far. See Shiloh in the video above.\nBut anyone who looks at him is disarmed; the stress melts away. And researchers say there is good reason. Animals can provide social support that can lower depression and improve job performance.\n\"They fill a need that people can't,\" said Zenithson Ng, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Tennessee, adding he frequently brings his black Labrador, Drizzie, and cat, Sunshine, to the office.\n\"They greet my dog and cat before they greet me,\" he said of his students and colleagues.\nShiloh was at a crossroads. Danette Bussey, Creative Displays' owner, said her daughter, Alexa, bought the rabbit at a pet store about 10 years ago. But the family was allergic. So she walked into the office one day, Shiloh in tow, and dropped him on Mahmoud's desk.\nThe two seem to have a nice relationship. Mahmoud starts her day, answers a few emails, then gets Shiloh from his cage in Bussey's office. The rabbit sits on Mahmoud's desk with stoicism. He looks content to be there, although he likely would look content pretty much anywhere.\n\"We just leave it on the desk,\" Emily Scotto, the company's project manager, said. \"It plays around, it hops on the floor, we take it outside. It’s nice because the thing is, animals bring happiness, right? Did you see his little face?\"\nHuman resources pros don't think office pets are a bad idea. One survey by the Robert Half employment agency found 55 percent of human resources managers think allowing pets in the office makes employees happier. And 37 percent think they can increase productivity.\nYet only 6 percent said their own offices allow pets all the time, the survey found.\n\"In the workplace, in particular, I do think animals are our social lubricants,\" Ng from the University of Tennessee said. \"It enhances our moods in the work day and offers stress relief.\"\nNot that pets in the office can't go wrong. Companies need to make sure their employees aren't allergic or afraid of animals. And they need to make sure their employees' pets don't",
        "baseline": " carry diseases and won't bite, Ng said.\nIn short, it isn't risk-free.\nBut Creative Displays' employees aren't allergic to Shiloh. And Shiloh kind of just sits there, graciously accepting pats on the head from customers, coworkers and visitors.\nWhich just might be the point.\nShiloh doesn't call workers into meetings to criticize their shoddy work. He doesn't give performance reviews. He doesn't gossip or back stab or take credit for your work. He agrees with you all the time, the rarest of breeds.\nHe turns scowls into smiles. What were we talking about again?\nOh, right. Mahmoud was asked if she had pets at home.\n\"I have a cat,\" she said. \"I’ve had a bunny before, too. They were outside bunnies. They were very hostile, so I wasn’t used to having such a nice bunny.\"",

The public can comment at the meeting, which begins at 7 p.m. in Durham City Hall downtown.\nAnd at the April 5 meeting, Mayor Pro Tem Jillian Johnson said: \"It’s important to note that Mayor Schewel’s statement is significantly different from the original petition we received on this issue, which I signed. The original petition from the “Demilitarize Durham to Palestine” campaign included language linking violent policing in the U.S. to tactics of the Israeli police and military.\"\nJohnson said she does not believe that \"it is inherently anti-Semitic to criticize Israeli policies and practice, just as I don’t believe it’s anti-American to criticize the practices of the U.S. military and police, which I do often.\"\nSeven Triangle rabbis have told the council they oppose the petition, calling it biased and bad policy. It was signed by Rabbi Larry Bach of Judea Reform Congregation; Rabbi Zalman Bluming of Chabad of Durham and Chapel Hill; Rabbi Daniel Greyber, Rabbi Jerry Fox and Rabbi Steven Sager of Beth El Synagogue; Rabbi Lucy Dinner of Temple Beth Or and Rabbi Eric Solomon of Beth Meyer Synagogue.\nAfter the April 5 statement, the council received a letter from the Anti-Defamation League's Washington, D.C., Regional Director Doron F. Ezickson who calls Jewish Voice for Peace \"a small and unrepresentative group whose fiercely anti-Israel organizational views are overwhelmingly rejected by the larger Jewish community, its institutions, and leaders.\"\nThe letter also questions the petition's language.\nCouncil members Vernetta Alston, Mark-Anthony Middleton and Javiera Caballero all said they plan to endorse the council statement at tonight's meeting.\nCouncil member DeDreana Freeman said the statement is \"very symbolic in a Black Lives Matter sort of way.\"\nCouncil member Charlie Reece, in an email to a resident, said he agrees with Schewel 'that sending our police officers overseas to receive military-style training does not make Durham safer, no matter what country hosts such training.\" Reece also said that \"contrary to what you may have heard, the city of Durham has no program for sending our police officers overseas to train with the military of any foreign country.\"\nAlso on Monday, the People's Alliance, which has a political action committee that endorsed Schewel, Reece, Johnson, Alston, Freeman and Caballero, sent a letter to the council supporting \"the campaign led by Triangle Jewish Voice for Peace to preclude any collaboration between the Durham Police Department and the Israeli",

        "prompt": "If you're serious about starting a blog but don't know much about hosting a website or coding HTML, Google's Blogger is the best free tool you'll find. The platform has been significantly redesigned and improved (existing users, make sure you're signed up for Blogger in Draft, which is like an open beta; the release should officially roll out to everyone sometime in July or August 2011) after years of being fairly stagnant. Team Blogger has finally tucked a rich text editor into the system—a long overdue change—and developed an amazing template designer that lets blog users customize the look of their blogs without ever touching a line of code.\nAs a veteran Blogger user, I've embraced the changes with open arms, welcoming integrated Analytics access, the better use of screen space in the dashboard, and simplified buttons and icons. Google needs to iron out some kinks before the dashboard goes global to all users, but they are few and far between. As free blogging platforms go, Blogger rocks equally as hard as our other Editors' Choice Wordpress.com (free, 4.5 stars). The only real difference between them is Wordpress has a steeper learning curve, although it is surmountable. Wordpress is also better at importing an existing blog from another blog site, which is useful to know if you're thinking of switching platforms, perhaps upgrading from the more simplistic Posterous (free, 3.5 stars) or Tumblr (free, 3 stars).\nBoth Wordpress.com and Blogger are free if you use a domain name that ends with the site's brand (.wordpress.com and .blogspot.com, respectively). If you're ready to pay for a custom domain name, Blogger's pricetag is a steal at $10 per year. That's the lowest I've seen, especially considering that Blogger will continue to host your content—no need to pay extra for storage. Wordpress.com charges $17 per year, which is a fair and reasonable rate, but it seems steep when compared to Blogger's.\nBecause Blogger is part of Google's empire, you need to create a Google account to have a Blog",
        "baseline": "ger account, meaning you'll have one login for all Google's services, such as Gmail and Google Docs. If you already have a Google account, just sign in and navigate to Blogger.com (or draft.blogger.com before July 31, 2011, to make sure you see the latest version).\nNext, give your blog a title and choose a URL—which must end in .blogspot.com during set up, even though you can pay for a custom domain name later if you want. Next, you choose a basic template as a starting point, which you can further customize soon. You're now set up and ready to start posting content or customizing the look of your blog.\nThe old Blogger dashboard worked fine but was heavy with tabs, which took some time to learn. The new dashboard uses ample white space and dropdown menus to put the tools you need in front you at the right times—no more searching through tabs to find what you need.",

        "prompt": "There is room for a party in the middle of British politics. The problem is the first-past-the-post system.\nBritain’s youngest political party is growing. The Independent Group (TIG) has attracted eight lawmakers from Labour and three from the Conservatives. A ninth Labour member of Parliament, Ian Austin, has left his party but not (yet) joined the new centrist group.\nPolls give TIG between 8 and 14 percent support.\nWriting a coherent platform that unites left- and right-wing views.\nI suspect the first will be easier than critics on the left and right allow. TIG’s statement of principles hints at a middle-of-the-road, liberal, social democratic program that could be broadly popular.\nThe second is the real hurdle. In 2010, the Liberal Democrats won 23 percent of the vote but only 9 percent of the seats in Parliament. Labour, by contrast, won almost 40 percent of the seats with only 29 percent of the vote.\nBuzzFeed has calculated that a party of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the EU in 2016 would win just 35 percent of the seats, so distorted is Britain’s electoral system.\nWith Labour careering far to left and the Conservatives wholly embracing Brexit, there is clearly room for a party in the middle of British politics.\nBut without electoral reform, it will be hard for TIG, or any third party, to break through.\nDefenders of the first-past-the-post system argue it makes Britain more governable, as it typically produces strong majorities for the ruling party.\nExcept in the last three elections. And in 1974. And 1964. And 1950.\nIf first-past-the-post really provided stability, Britain wouldn’t have had so many snap elections. In the sixty years since the end of World War II, it has actually had about as many elections as multiparty Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.\nAnd if stability is what you want, why stop at two parties? One-party systems are the most stable in the world — until, of course, they aren’t.\nAnother argument is that coalition governments are indecisive, but most of the time voters want their country “tweaked but not turned upside down,” as political commentator Jan",
        "baseline": "an Ganesh has argued.\nTwo-party systems can veer from one extreme to another. Multiparty democracies generally have more consistent policies, which allows businesses and citizens to plan ahead.\nElections in a two-party system are an all-or-nothing contest where the losing side will feel completely powerless for four or five years. This can make it harder to govern if the winning party has a small majority; unable to make deals with other parties, it can be held hostage by its own hardliners. That it what’s happened in the Conservative Party over Brexit.\nFinally, two-party systems encourage polarization. They delude voters into thinking there are only two sides to every issue and they force them to pick a team. We can see this most clearly in the United States, where voters choose a party and then assume its beliefs, rather than the other way around. In multiparty systems, voters are less loyal to their parties and more true to their beliefs.",

The events of Avengers: Infinity War changed the shared universe forever, as a ton of heroes and villains fell to Thanos' horrifying wrath. The future of the MCU after Avengers 4 is largely a mystery, and there have been plenty of ideas thrown around for the next Phase of films. One of the most common rumors is an all-female Marvel movie, which was reportedly pitched to Kevin Feige by a bunch of the stars at a party. Now the fans have gotten together and made a poster featuring the MCU's femme fatales, and it's absolutely awesome. Check it out.\nDoes anyone else have chills? While this post might be a result of photo shop and promo images, seeing the shared universe's female characters united in one shot is enough to get even the most casual fanboy excited.\nThis new image comes to us from Reddit, where user evokkin uploaded a poster for the fictional Marvel movie A Force. Using the Avengers logo and promo photos from the MCU's recent movies, all of the female heroes are united, including newcomers The Wasp and Captain Marvel. There have slowly been more dynamic female characters introduced into the MCU, so they could definitely carry a movie. Of course, it's unclear exactly who will survive after the events of Avengers 4.\nBecause while Marvel fans were expecting a few characters to die during Avengers: Infinity War, moviegoers were shocked to see Josh Brolin's Thanos actually succeed on his mission. After accruing all of the Infinity Stones, Thanos was able to wipe out half the galaxy with the snap of a finger, leaving just a handful of heroes in the wake of his destruction. If many of these ladies have any chance of crossing over, the remaining Avengers are going to have to find a way to reverse Thanos' snap somehow.\nThanos' plans for destruction aside, women in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have taken a much larger role in Phase Three. Plenty of newcomers debuted, with Mantis joined Gamora in the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Valkyrie being introduced in Thor: Ragnarok, and Okoye",

In addition to being a logistical nightmare, there's probably no logical narrative way to set it up. But the various franchises have collided through Infinity War and presumably Avengers 4, so there's no telling what's in store for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nAnt-Man and The Wasp is in theaters now, marking the first time a female hero has had a MCU movie named after them.

He has to walk the talk and he hasn’t. He should have lifted the state of emergency by now,” Nega told Reuters TV in Kenya where he traveled after his release from a prison outside the capital Addis Ababa.\n“We were released not because the government wanted to release us but because the people demand it and there was the threat of imminent violence. They had imprisoned us under false charges,” he said.\nSpeaking of his time in jail, he said: “The aim was not only to imprison you physically, but to break",

The 60-year-old La Cañada resident serves on the human resources committee of YMCA of the Foothills and is a member herself, but was always too busy or too shy to enroll in one of the many fitness programs offered there.\n\"I hesitated to come because I didn't want to feel overwhelmed by totally fit younger people,\" she said.\nBut last week she made a major life change, becoming a vegetarian and adopting an alkaline-rich diet. This week is about developing a fitness regimen, she said.\nIn that vein, Bengtson-Budzyn attended a Tuesday morning low-impact cardio and strength-training class led by YMCA instructor Celia Weiss. Her new commitment to a healthier lifestyle couldn't have been better timed.\nYMCA of the Foothills recently rolled out a new initiative called 50 Moving Forward at its La Cañada and Tujunga locations. A nationwide collaboration with pharmaceutical company Pfizer, Inc., it aims to help people ages 50 to 64 become physically fit, socially engaged and educated about living well and preventing illness.\nThe program, being piloted at just 25 of the nation's 967 YMCA associations, has four components — fitness, health, prevention and fun — and features events that are free and open to the public, according to Rosanne Malogolowkin, executive director of Crescenta-Cañada Family YMCA. So far, nearly 200 locals have signed up for activities running through May 31. The goal is to have 1,000 enrollees.\n\"Every week we have at least three physical activities or events, and there is at least one other event around health screenings or fun,\" Malogolowkin said. \"But I want to build off that. There's so much more we can do.\"\nAbout 20 people showed up Tuesday to Weiss' class and spent an hour working out to disco hits like \"Funky Town\" and Beyonce and Lady Gaga remixes.\n\"I believe if you work at it, you will get results,\" Weiss told the group.\nIn the crowd was Barbara Coleman, 62, of Pasadena, a daily exerciser who came at the behest of a friend and to try something new.\n\"This was a good change of pace,\" she said after class. \"It doesn't intimidate you like when you're with the younger ones.\"\nIn addition to exercise-oriented Zumba, cycling, aquafit and yoga, participants can join a walking club, attend a weekly \"Doc Talk\" series given by local health care providers or go on hiking trips to Whiting Woods or Echo Mountain. The plan is for attendees to build relationships that will encourage healthy behaviors, Malogolowkin said.\nOne 50 Moving Forward newcomer was Pasadena resident Eddie Newman, 65, whose friend, Cynthia Roye, is on the board of the YMCA of the Foothills and encouraged her to come out.\n\"She texted me and said there was an over-50 class starting today,\" Newman said",

        "prompt": "No point in telling parents about children's weight?\nNEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - School polices that let parents know when their children are overweight or obese appear to have little impact on the problem, according to a U.S. study.\nIn the last decade, almost all public schools in California collected information about the height and weight of fifth, seventh and ninth graders, but only some schools opted to send the results to parents — giving Kristine Madsen, at the University of California, San Francisco, a chance to evaluate the impact of that notification.\nShe found that, years later, children whose parents were told they were overweight were no more likely to have lost weight at that point than children whose parents were not notified, according to a report published in the Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine.\nSo perhaps schools should concentrate their efforts on interventions that have the most impact, such as making sure that school lunches are healthier, and increasing the use of physical activity.\n“Physical education is probably the most underused public health tool we have,” she told Reuters Health.\nHer findings were based on data from nearly 7 million children.\nLetting parents know their children are too heavy could still have an impact, Madsen said, noting that most parents were notified by letter, which some may not have gotten.\nIn addition, almost none of the letters used the terms “overweight” or “obese,” instead referring to body mass index (BMI) — a measure of weight relative to height — which some parents may not have understood.\nHealth experts are currently divided over the benefits",
        "baseline": " of schools screening children for BMI. Currently, the Institute of Medicine recommends it, along with parental notification, but other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association, maintain there is not enough evidence to support the practice.\nThe nation’s schools reflect that division. As of 2006, 41 percent of school districts required officials to measure children’s height and weight, and three-quarters of those schools informed parents of the results.\nThat the current system is not having an effect is not a huge surprise, Madsen said. Even if parents modify the home environment by providing healthier meals, for example, if nothing changes at school — where children spend most of their time, it’s going to be hard to see any impact.\nIn addition, a single letter may not be enough to convince parents to make drastic changes at home, she added.\n“Most parents are already doing the best they can,” she said.",

        "prompt": "Machines as intelligent as humans will be invented by 2029, predicts technologist Ray Kurzweil. \"Nonsense,\" retorts roboticist Rodney Brooks. By that time, he says, machines will only be as smart as a mouse. As for humanlike intelligence — that may arrive by 2200.\nBetween these two forecasts — machines with human intelligence in 11 or 182 years — lies much of the rest of the artificial intelligence community, a disputatious lot who disagree on nearly everything about their field, Martin Ford, author of a new book on AI, tells Axios.\nWrites Axios' Kaveh Waddell: Ford is the author of the best-selling and well-reviewed \"Rise of the Robots,\" a dystopian 2015 tract on the sorry coming state of working humans in the new age of automation. Today, he follows it up with \"Architects of Intelligence,\" a collection of interviews he conducted over the last year with almost two dozen of the West's most illustrious artificial intelligence hands.\nHis main takeaway: \"This is an unsettled field,\" Ford told Kaveh yesterday. \"It's not like physics.\"\nAI may seem to be a smooth-running assembly line of startups, products and research projects.\nThe reality, however, is a landscape clouded by uncertainty, Ford says. His interviewees could not agree on where their field stands, how to push it forward or when it will reach its ultimate goal: a machine with humanlike intelligence.\nWhy it matters: The embryonic state in which Ford found AI — so early in its development more than a half-century after its birth that the basics are still up for grabs — suggests how far it has to go before reaching maturity. On his blog, Brooks has said that AI is only 1% of the way toward human intelligence.\nThe big picture: Research in the field has progressed in fits and starts since the term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined in the 1950s by American computer scientist John McCarthy, alternating between periods of hibernation and feverish activity.\nThe current frenzy is propelled by the wild success of deep learning, an AI technique that excels at finding patterns and identifying objects in photographs.\nFew of Ford's subjects said deep learning will arrive at humanlike intelligence on its own — they said something new must be developed to get there. But deep learning aficionados ridicule the alternatives suggested by others.\nKurzweil, Google’s director of engineering, stands out on many fronts, Ford says. For one, he has very little patience for colleagues suffering from \"engineer’s pessimism.\"\nHumanlike intelligence will emerge in an exponential burst of innovation, Kurzweil said, not in linear fashion, as so many others seem to think.\n\"What Ray says is correct,\" says Ford. \"Engineer's pessimism is what's at play; the question is who's right\" — the pessimist or the optimist.\nFord's follow-up book is a collection of interviews he conducted with the West's most illustrious artificial intelligence hands.\nWhat's next: Not all was discord. There was a remarkable confluence, for instance, on the most promising coming step.\nMany called for an exploration of \"unsupervised learning,\" an AI that, like a child, can wander around, poking and prodding, getting into trouble, and meanwhile learning a lot of important stuff about the world.\nThat’s a stark departure from current AI training methods, which require reams of labeled data: think photos of cats that are explicitly labeled as cats.\n\"Today, in order to teach a computer what a coffee mug is, we show it thousands of coffee mugs. But no child’s parents, no matter how patient and loving, ever pointed out thousands of coffee mugs to that child.\"\nAs we've been reporting, the U.S. and China seem to be barreling toward a division of the world into two giant, competing fiefdoms, each with largely isolated trade and communications.\nDriving the news: In the latest development, reported by the WSJ, the U.S. has been urging carriers in allied countries to stop using communications equipment produced by China's Huawei, which American officials say could contain spying mechanisms.\nBut the WSJ follows up today that at least one target of this lobbying effort — Papua New Guinea — has rejected the U.S. campaign and is proceeding with a 3,400-mile internet network from Huawei.\nJanice Gross Stein, a professor at the University of Toronto, says the U.S. and Australia are part of the effort to exclude Huawei and ZTE from use by allied companies in what she calls \"rebordering.\"\n\"The U.S. and Australian push to prevent Huawei from gaining access to 5G networks is driven by some genuine security concerns, but they are also consistent with what I described as the 'rebordering of the West,'\" Stein tells Axios.\nAmid rising worries regarding the development of human-level machine intelligence, a prominent Berkeley research organization has become the first to stop openly publishing all of its findings.\nWhy it matters: The move by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute is a break from a traditional standard of openness in computer-science research.\nWe’ve reported before on researchers’ questions about the right amount of openness and transparency when discussing potentially dangerous work. This is the most extreme reaction we’ve seen yet.\nIt comes as AI researchers are quietly deliberating how to react to the potential malicious use of AI.\nMIRI worries that open publishing could aid progress toward an unchecked super-intelligent machine.\nToday, AI researchers routinely first post their papers at Arxiv, an entirely free and open, non-peer-reviewed repository for scientific papers.\nDetails: MIRI — which has received funding from AI dystopians like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk’s Future of Life Institute — posted a strategy document on Thanksgiving outlining its new policy of \"nondisclosed-by-default research.\"\n\"Most results discovered within MIRI will remain internal-only unless there is an explicit decision to release those results, based usually on a specific anticipated safety upside from their release,\" wrote MIRI executive director Nate Soares.\n\"It does seem to me to be useful that an AI research organization has taken this step, if only so that it generates data for the community about what the consequences are of taking such a step.\"\nOpenAI, another prominent AI research nonprofit, wrote in its charter that it expects that \"safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future.\"\nJack Clark, OpenAI’s policy director, said the organization is still in the early stages of",

Then, a massive meteorite appears to have struck, destroying everything in a 15-mile-wide circle. So traumatic was the catastrophe that no one resettled there for six or seven centuries, according to a new study.\nUntil the suspected meteorite, some 40,000–65,000 people lived in the area north of the Dead Sea, called Middle Ghor, Phillip Silvia, a professor at Trinity Southwest University in Albuquerque, tells Science News' Bruce Bower.\nThe collapse of the Middle Ghor civilization happened suddenly in the late Bronze Age.\nFor instance, pottery that Silvia unearthed seems to have melted into zircon crystals, which \"formed within one second at extremely high temperature,\" Bower reported.",

        "prompt": "This guest post was written by Morgan Bolt.\nDetails from Job plagued by devils, by Lucas Vorsterman (I), after Peter Paul Rubens, 1619-1675, public domain.\nI’m 25 years old and I have Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors, a tenacious, rare, and deadly cancer. The last three years of my life have been filled with every sort of cancer treatment available, including dozens of cycles of chemotherapy, numerous surgeries, multiple rounds of radiation, and even experimental clinical trials. It’s been grueling, to say the least. I’m already living on borrowed time, and I have no idea how much more I’ll get.\nThere’s no good reason for my cancer, and I won’t pretend otherwise. It didn’t happen so I could learn some important lesson, and it isn’t punishment for some sin of mine. My cancer — like a deadly storm or earthquake — is just one of those things that happens when you’re part of an ever-changing world composed of dynamic systems. There doesn’t have to be a clear, palatable, or satisfying answer for why such hardships take place.\nI think that’s the main point of the story of Job. Job faces incredible suffering through no fault of his own, though his friends don’t see it that way. They blame Job for his hardships, claiming that if he only repented he would be restored to health and fortune. But Job rebukes such thinking, maintaining his innocence while acknowledging that none are righteous before God. At the end of the story God shows up. God does not reveal to Job a satisfying reason for his suffering. God simply challenges Job, reminding Job of his smallness and insignificance compared to God and all God’s works. God makes it clear that everything afflicting Job is not some divine retribution for misdeeds, nor is it all part of some painful lesson that God has decided Job must learn in the hardest way possible. Job’s hardships simply happened.\nIt’s not a nice, satisfying answer, but I’ve found that the easier, nicer, and more satisfying an answer, the more exceptions there are to it. Though Job wonders aloud in chapter 21, verse 7, “why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?” he never gets an answer. The Book of Job, as I understand it, as much examines the question “why do good things happen to bad people?” as it asks “why do bad things happen to good people?” and the answer to both questions is the same, I think. Perhaps it’s because they just do. The world is filled with variables. Sometimes they simply won’t play out in our favor.\nIt reminds me of a passage in Chapter 9 of the Gospel according to John when Jesus and his disciples encounter a man with blindness. The disciples ask “who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus refutes their thinking, answering “it was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him” (John 9:3). Like the Book of Job, this doesn’t give us a particularly straightforward or satisfying answer as to why, but it clearly shows us why not.\nAilments and difficulties are not retribution for sin, either ours or our ancestors’. I did not get cancer through some sin of mine, my parents, my grandparents, or beyond. I simply got cancer, just like the man in John was blind from birth through no moral failing of his or anyone else’s, and just as Job suffered great hardships without deserving them as a punishment.\nThe stories from John 9 and the Book of Job demonstrate that God’s purposes and designs are, ultimately, beyond our reckoning. Whatever answers we invent to life’s toughest questions, we are unable to truly understand except when God grants us wisdom. Many times, things just happen and life is neither just nor fair. Whether or not we like what’s happening in our lives isn’t always relevant, and we make fools of ourselves when we ascribe moral factors to our circumstances.\nHow has all this helped me deal with my own cancer? It means I haven’t ever blamed myself or God for my cancer, and I haven’t let others do so either. It means that even while I look for lessons to learn, and as God has helped me grow from the life experiences my cancer has given me, I don’t worry that I have cancer just to",

I don’t waste my time wondering why I have cancer or what reason there is for my illness. The lesson I take from Job and the story of John 9 is that not everything happens for a reason. My cancer — like Job’s suffering, the unnamed man’s blindness, and just about everything else — doesn’t have to have a satisfying reason or a moral cause behind it. My cancer simply is, and blessed be God’s name through it all.\nMorgan Bolt was diagnosed with DSRCT cancer in 2014 at the age of 23.

        "prompt": "The state requires all public schools to report 16 types of criminal and violent acts. In CMS and across the state, possession of drugs and weapons other than guns accounts for more than 70 percent of all episodes. Assaults on school personnel, which can range from serious attacks to a push in the hallway, and alcohol possession run third and fourth, with everything else accounting for less than 5 percent of offenses.\nThe state calculates a ratio of criminal and violent acts in high schools, where most such offenses take place. CMS’ rate of 15.3 acts per 1,000 high school students tops the state average (13.2) and levels for Wake (12.5) and Guilford (14.8), the state’s other large districts.\nLatasha Smith, the CMS administrator in charge of discipline, noted that crime and violence rose in Charlotte last year.\n“We’re seeing the same things in society that mirrors what we’re seeing in schools,” Smith said.\nCharter schools, which are public schools run by independent boards, reported a much lower rate of criminal and violent incidents. An Observer tally of incidents for 31 charter schools in and near Mecklenburg County showed an overall rate of 2.6 per 1,000 students, a tally that includes younger students.\nIn charters and in CMS, rates varied by school. Several charter and CMS schools reported no incidents last school year, while others had high rates. In small schools, a few incidents can spike the rates.\nCMS logged extremely high crime/violence rates at three small special schools. Lincoln Heights and Metro schools serve students with severe disabilities, and most of their incidents involved assaults on school staff. Turning Point Academy is an alternative school for students with serious disciplinary issues; most of its incidents involved possession of drugs or alcohol.\nFor several years, CMS has been trying to reduce out-of-school suspensions.\nIn 2011-12, CMS was logging almost 50 short-term suspensions per 1,000 high school students, compared with a state average of 30. The latest CMS rate was down to 21.3 per 1,000 – still well above the state average (19.5) and Wake (10.4) and Guilford (13.3), but less than half the rate of three years earlier.\nNot only does sending students home set them back academically, but local and national data show that black students – especially males – get suspended at disproportionate rates for what educators call “discretionary offenses.” Those are actions that involve a faculty judgment call and don’t create danger at school, things such as insubordination, failure to follow rules, and arguments or minor scuffles between students.\nSmith and CMS Chief Accountability Officer Frank Barnes said the district has been training staff – not just teachers but others who deal with students, such as bus drivers – in techniques for talking to students in ways that calm them, rather than escalating a conflict or emotional outburst.\nSchools are trying alternatives to suspension. For instance, Barnes and Smith said, a student disrupting class might be removed from the room but kept in school to work in another location. Students caught fighting might be referred to a class in anger management, along with their parents. Getting families involved in solutions is crucial, CMS officials said, because many of the problems at school come from homes and neighborhoods.\nThis school year, the district is working with the International Institute for Restorative Practices on a five-school trial program in problem-solving techniques. Faculty at Vance High, Martin and King middle schools, Morehead STEM Academy (a K-8 magnet school) and Hidden Valley Elementary are learning tactics such as restorative circles, in which students causing problems talk with the people affected by them, with everyone taking responsibility for solutions.\nFor instance, Smith said, a student who is frequently disruptive might hear from classmates for whom he makes it harder for them to finish their work, leaving them with more homework.\nCMS reported 22,196 short-term suspensions last school year, down from 24,121 the year before. Suspensions of up to 10 days account for the vast majority of disciplinary actions across the state, and the state total rose slightly last year.\nLong-term suspensions in CMS rose from eight to 46, which officials cite as a sign that they’re not giving students a break on major infractions. Those suspensions, which can include assignment to an alternative school, are reserved for the most serious offenses.\n“While we’re here to support you, to educate you and to care for you, there are consequences,” Smith said.\nExpulsion is rare across North Carolina, with 42 students expelled statewide. Two were from CMS.\nThe drop in short-term suspensions means students spent more time in school, at a",
        "baseline": " time when enrollment continued to grow and graduation rates hit a record high.\nBut it didn’t eliminate the racial disparity. Black students, who accounted for 40 percent of CMS enrollment last school year, received 79 percent of the short-term suspensions, up slightly from 77 percent the year before.\nAcross the state, black students, males and ninth-graders were the most likely to be suspended.\nHere are the number of short-term suspensions (one to 10 days), long-term suspensions (11 days to the remainder of a school year) and expulsions reported for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in the past two school years.\nHere are schools in CMS with the highest number of criminal or violent incidents in 2014-15, calculated per 1,000 students. Because many schools have fewer than 1,000 students, the rate might be higher than the number of incidents. Lincoln Heights, Turning Point and Metro are small schools for students with disabilities or behavior issues.",

        "prompt": "All the hype coming into this was about Rohit's record at Eden, but it was Ishan Kishan's blitzkrieg which stole the show today. MUM are doing it again, aren't they? They've so rudely slipped into the top four, just when you would have started thinking that it's too late. It's never too late. Funny that, because it's midnight. I'm out of here. We're out of here. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Akshay Maanay, Nikhil Jadhav, Abhinand Raghavendran, Srivathsa and our scorer Praveen. Bye!\nIshan Kishan, MoM: Had a chat with my skipper, he told me to go there and back myself. My plan was to look at the ball till the last moment and keep smacking. Have to believe in yourself, your strengths. Win was important for us, point was to stay there, back yourself and put up a good show. I'm okay with batting anywhere depending on the team situation.\nRohit, MUM captain: As a team we tend to pick up during the month of May. Hope we do it sooner. Never easy to be on the line all the time and be desperate for wins towards the second half. Would like to start the tournament on a high. But in the past three years, we've been at the bottom of the table. I'm glad we came together and performed as a team today. Without a doubt, the way Ishan Kishan batted fearlessly, that was the changing point. I was assessing the pitch at that point, ball was sticking in the pitch, it wasn't easy, but he changed the game. We were 65 after first ten overs, but scoring 145 in last ten overs is a magnificent effort by all the batters. Ben Cutting as well, he hasn't been getting much opportunity as well, it's not easy to come out and play shots like that. We as a team are prepared to post a total or chase down what is put in front of us. Can't do much with the toss. Have to come out here and play good cricket. Last few games, the team has come together and taken responsibility.\nBen Cutting - Yeah good win. It was a bit tight the other night. Nice to get out there for a bat. Played a couple of big hits and had a bowl too. That's the nature of the T20 League, so many strong batters. You just have to wait for your time and do the best when you can. I think we are building momentum definitely. We have three games to go, two at home and one at Delhi; let's see what happens.\nKarthik, KOL captain: 200 is always a big ask. We didn't bat well enough. If we had held on to our catches, you never know. It was a good batting wicket. When you lose wickets in the powerplay, you are always playing catch up. We weren't in the game after the powerplay. We just took it as a normal game. Chin up for the boys and keep moving forward. We need to raise our skill levels and that is the most important thing. This kind of losses can put you down and that is where I as a leader need to stand up. Be honest about it. We need to believe and I have to make them believe we can make it to the playoffs.\n11.32pm local: KOL dismantled here at Eden. Such is the margin of the result that MUM have climbed past them to fourth spot. After Mumbai registered the highest T20 League total at this venue, it didn't take long for the run-chase to dramatically go off the rails for the hosts. They lost Narine second ball, and then Lynn was run out just when he was finding some rhythm. The run-chase never appeared like taking off, probably down to the psychological wood that Mumbai have on them. As it often happens with big targets, you have to go for the jugular, and in doing that, sometimes it comes off and many times it doesn't. Unfortunately, KOL fell in the second category.\nKrunal Pandya to Kuldeep Yadav, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!\nKrunal Pandya to Tom Curran, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nCutting to Chawla, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nBumrah to Rinku Singh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nHardik Pandya to Nitish Rana, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nHardik Pandya to Nitish Rana, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!\nThird umpire called in for a run-out check. Hardik is not sure. He might have broken the stumps without the ball. Karthik is the one in question. The ball is in touch with his fingers as he whips the bails. Touch and go this. Kumar Dharmasena is the one in the hot seat. He is going for different angles. OUT!\nTimeout! It has been all Mumbai so far. They started by getting rid of Narine in the first over. Lynn was thrown under",
        "baseline": " the bus by Uthappa and Russell's promotion up the order also did not work out. This is the last recognised pair for KOL and they have to play out of their skins to pull this off.\nHardik Pandya to A Russell, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nMarkande to Uthappa, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!\nJoint lowest PP score for KOL this season. They made 47 at Wankhede as well couple of days ago.\nKrunal Pandya to Uthappa, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!\nKrunal Pandya to Uthappa, no run, stifled appeal for LBW. No discussion regarding the review. The drifter which slides on, Uthappa went down to play the sweep, misses and is rapped on the pads. The ball might have been sliding down leg?\nMcClenaghan to Narine, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!",

No legal complaints have been filed at this stage regarding police violence on migrants,” he told Reuters.\nMigrants fleeing poverty and war in the Middle East, Asia and Africa go to Calais hoping to cross the short stretch of sea to Britain by trying to leap on trucks and trains, or even walk through the tunnel under the Channel.\nHundreds of migrants and refugees have been returning to the port city despite the dismantling of the “jungle” camp that housed thousands of people late last year.\nDozens of police are still deployed permanently in the area where the camp once stood.\n“These last few days, in the mornings, security forces have been coming to",

It actually happened 50 years ago this week and, typically with Scotland, the win followed two disastrous defeats and a week on the sauce by a thirsty post-season Scotland squad, led a bubbly dance by the great Jim Baxter.\nYesterday I met Ian Ure, now aged 72 and one of the Scottish survivors from that famous night in Madrid. Ure's career was a saga in itself, having starred for a Dundee side which reached the semi-finals of the European Cup before being sold to Arsenal in 1963 for £62,500. The fee was a world record for a centre-half.\nWith his distinctive mop of blond hair and tall, rugged features, Ure often resembled a Norse warrior on the pitch and he found his way to the top of the English game. His career was blighted by injury and erratic form at Arsenal – and at Manchester United – but none of that diminishes the memory of those heady days in 1963 when he had the football world at his feet.\nDundee's 1962/63 season remains staggering. En route to the European Cup semi-finals they hammered German champions Cologne 8-1 at Dens Park, and also saw off Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht before facing AC Milan in the last four.\nTying 1-1 at half-time in the first leg in the San Siro, it has been alleged by John Rafferty, the old Scotsman football correspondent, among others, that Dundee got ahead of themselves and went ludicrously gung-ho, ending up losing 5-1 on the night. Bob Shankly's men won the return at Dens 1-0 but the dream was over.\n\"We should have won the European Cup that year,\" said Ure. \"I am convinced we would have. The final was at Wembley [against Benfica] and the pitch was like a bowling green in the early 1960s and would have suited our style of play.\n\"But that night in the San Siro we got hit with three rapid goals in the second half and the game was over. Typical Italians; bang, bang, bang – that was it. But at half-time, at 1-1, by God we felt we were right in it. We were every bit as good as Milan.\"\nThat was early May. Within weeks the talk was of Ure's imminent move to Arsenal for a record fee, but one more bit of business awaited him: an end of season Scotland tour under manager Ian McColl, taking in three away matches: Norway, Ireland and Spain.\nThis was a Scotland squad dripping with talent, and with consistently parched throats: Baxter, Willie Henderson, Ian St John, Denis Law, Dave Mackay and others. The sepia-tinted talent of these players alone is enough to make a modern Scotland fan weep.\n\"We had a strong squad back then and, as preparation for facing Spain, we played Norway and Eire,\" Ure recalled. \"These were supposed to be skoosh games – back then Norway and Eire were nothing. Well, we lost to both and I think I know why. There was some heavy drinking the night before both games.\n\"We lost 4-3 to Norway in Bergen. For the Ireland game, the selection committee axed half the team. We got to Dalymount Park where it was blowing a gale and we lost that one 1-0. These were two bad defeats and the press were going mad at us.\"\nBedraggled Scotland duly arrived in Madrid, seemingly to be clubbed like a seal by Spain, who 12 months later would be crowned European champions.\n\"We got to Madrid and by this point Ian McColl didn't have a clue what he was doing – he was done-in by those two defeats. We played a makeshift team in Spain that night, and yet look at the players we fielded: [Billy] McNeill, Baxter, Henderson, Law, St John, Davie Wilson and more.\n\"Spain took the lead early on [after seven minutes] and I can remember Billy McNeill and I both scrambling to retrieve the ball from the back of our net and saying, 'Jesus Christ, this is going to be some night.' We thought we were in for a hiding. But then we equalised, and got another, and another, and we went in 4-2 up at half-time.\n\"We popped in two more for good measure. The Spanish crowd didn't like it one bit. Stuff was being thrown on to the pitch.\"\nOn the spot the Scottish press fairly changed their tune. From lambasting the players as slovenly no-gooders, Baxter and co were suddenly decreed to be the greatest exponents in all Christendom.\nYet was it really such a big thing among the players? \"No, not really,\" said Ure. \"Don't get me wrong, it was a fine win, and to score six goals anywhere is good going. But the gap between Spain and Scotland back then was nothing like it is today. So, no, we were by no means flabbergasted.\"\nUre was arguably typical of some fine Scotland players of the time. He duly signed for Arsenal that summer but, unlike St John and Alan Gilzean, his Dundee team-mate who went to Tottenham Hotspur, he would not excel in England, in part due to a troublesome right knee that grew more ruined with every passing season.\nAfter life at Dens Park, playing in England was a culture shock to him. The place was littered with quick, darting inside-forwards and battering-ram strikers.\n\"Up until then I was the one that did the tackling, but down there everyone – forwards, inside-forwards – was tackling me,\" he said. \"There is no doubt about it, it was a big step up for me for me to play for Arsenal.\n\"I had terrible knee troubles from about my second season at Arsenal [1964/65] and was swallowing pills just to",
        "baseline": " keep me on the park. I feel, but for my knee trouble, it could have been so much better for me down there. But I still had nine enjoyable years in England.\"\nIn 1969, Ure was surprisingly signed by Manchester United, and both he and Arsenal kept his terrible knee problem a secret. \"At the time they were looking for a stop-gap centre-half. Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for them, they didn't know how bad my knee was.\n\"The medical at Manchester United was a farce. They said to me, 'can you bend your knee?' I said, 'aye, watch . . .' That was it. My knee was passed fit. I keep saying it: I wouldn't have signed me in the state I was in Because of my knee, I'd basically been on the slide since the mid-1960s.\"\nFor all that, June 13, 1963 is a date in Spain which Ure will never forget.",
        "llm_baseline": "I came out of a bad situation.I was never the same player after that.I was never the same player after that. \" Ure ' s career was a saga in itself,as he played for a Dundee side which reached the semi-finals of the European Cup before being sold to Manchester United in 1963 for£62,300.The£62,500 price tagset a club record for a centre-back.With his distinctive mop of blond hair and tall,rugged features,Ure often resembled a Norse warrior on the pitch and he found his way to the top of the English game.His career was blighted by injury and erratic performances at Arsenal–and at Manchester United–but none of that diminishes the memory of those heady days in 1963 when he had the football ing world at his feet.The story ofDundee ' s 1962/63 season remains staggering.En route to the European Cup semi-finals they hammered defending champions Cologne 0 0 1 at Dens Park,and also saw them take on the likes of Lisbon and Ander",

        "prompt": "PAUL MORGAN'S FIRST novel, The Pelagius Book, begins with a series of fractured images - a bow, life's arrow, the memory of clouds moving over a child, their changing shapes. Its method echoes these opening lines - allusive, poetic, shot through with echoes of classical philosophy and, perhaps more importantly, a sense of the immensity of the world that lies beyond the realm of language.\nHis second, Turner's Paintbox, makes this last explicit, casting its story of love found and lost against the backdrop of Turner's vast tableaus. Set in a very contemporary Sydney, it plots the course of the relationship between Gerard, an art adviser, and Julia, a teacher, teasing out the elements of their pasts that initially draw them together and finally drive them apart.\nAs a conceit it's a striking one, though perhaps less so than the vision that underpinned The Pelagius Book, which drew on the life of the radical monk, Pelagius, during the last days of the Roman Empire. For Gerard, Turner is a touchstone, a master of technique, and, simultaneously, a man who navigated the waters where art and commerce meet with an assurance few can match.\nHe is also - ironically - the foundation of Gerard's own career, which really began when the head curator on an exhibition of Turner in Australia died unexpectedly, leaving Gerard to write the catalogue and reap the benefits of the exhibition's success. But as becomes increasingly clear when Gerard falls in love with Julia, his grasp on Turner, and indeed life, is less assured than he might think. For Gerard art and beauty are all. And yet his is a conception of beauty that leaves little room for the messy business of life.\nJulia, by contrast, is all life. The daughter of Spanish immigrants, she moves through the world in a state of glorious disorder, loving too much and too quickly, taking up new enthusiasms and letting them go again just as easily, bringing an effortless pleasure to everybody she knows.\nFor Gerard she is irresistible, but as their relationship deepens its flaws gradually become more and more apparent. This tension is given its most literal expression in Gerard's frustration with Julia's messy presence in the coolly elegant white Seidler apartment overlooking the harbour he eventually buys, \"curved like his Shell building in Melbourne, floored with cool travertine\".\nMorgan depicts Gerard and Julia's relationship with assurance, capturing both its early abandon and the slow, sad process of their drifting apart in long, looping chapters that move back and forth across the years with fluid economy.\nGerard's voice is at once lush and slightly fussy, as seems appropriate, his appreciation of Julia aesthetic rather than sensual. And the marriage of the novel's two worlds - that of Turner and contemporary Australia - is often striking, particularly in scenes such as the one in which Gerard encounters a cyclist looming out of the dawn gloaming like \"a silently moving cloud of malevolence . . . A single golden eye stared about, seeking me out. It bore down on me like death on a pale horse: I stopped and stared, filled with horror and unable to",
        "baseline": " move.\"\nBut simultaneously the novel seems less tethered in the real than its detailed evocation of Sydney might suggest. In part this is a function of Gerard's narration and its particular blindnesses. For Gerard, the world is something to be contained by the aesthetic, its pain and disorder made orderly and comprehensible, and despite his best efforts it's hard for him to step outside the frame of reference he has contained himself within.\nBut it's also a function of a book whose characters also seem to exist in the oddly idealised and heightened state novels about art too often seem to fall into.\nIt's a curious dilemma, not least because of the way it echoes the tension at the novel's heart. But it's also indicative of the ambition that underpins Morgan's fiction, his preparedness to take risks. For while Turner's Paintbox may lack the gem-like precision and hidden depths of its predecessor, it goes a long way towards meeting the challenges it sets for itself.",

        "prompt": "It is fashionable among political pundits to declare that the rise last year in the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions was the result of forces beyond U.S. control: as high-growth countries like China and India increase their use of coal, emissions go up.\nBut there are factors contributing to this that we can do something about. Coal accounts for about 40 percent of global carbon emissions. Many countries with fast-growing economies, like those in Asia, place a great deal of importance on coal and look to the U.S. for leadership in developing cleaner coal-burning technologies.\nAs the nation with the largest coal resources and one that relies on coal for 30 percent of its electricity, we should be the world leader in the development and demonstration of advanced coal technology, including fluidized bed combustion, coal gasification, carbon capture and storage, and ultra-supercritical pulverized coal technology. But we no longer are, having forfeited that role to China, which uses more coal than the rest of the world combined and where it is the fuel of choice.\nInstead of increasing funds for research, the Office of Management and Budget proposed a 55 percent cut in the budget for the Fossil Energy Research and Development program, which conducts research on advanced coal technology. It would be funded at $280 million in 2018, far lower than the 2017 funding level of $618 million. That contradicts President Trump desires to make coal production a major priority.\nThose who question the value of research on coal-burning technologies ignore the likelihood that much of the world will be relying on coal for electricity production well into the future. We cannot pretend, as we are currently doing, that emission-free solar and wind power can be scaled up rapidly enough to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants to lower levels under the global Paris climate agreement by 2025. Ditto for nuclear and hydro. Instead, we should focus on real-world solutions, not dreams.\nA better option than research on solar and wind – which together supply only 8 percent of U.S. electricity and even less globally – would be to shift more funding to advanced coal processing. Ultra-supercritical pulverized coal technology, for example, uses less coal and increases power-plant efficiency by as much as 50 percent compared to conventional coal plants. This technology is drawing more and more interest around the world because of its ability to generate electricity more efficiently while simultaneously curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so would make it easier to develop a plan to increase wind and solar energy production as well nuclear and hydro.\nAn ultra-supercritical plant began operating in Arkansas in 2012. By contrast, China today has nearly 90 plants that generate electricity with this advanced technology – and more are planned. Should other countries follow suit",
        "baseline": ", it would mean a promising path toward a reduction in carbon emissions from coal-burning technology.\nCoal remains the dominant fuel globally for power generation. We cannot afford to stick our heads in the sand and pretend we don’t need to use research and develop more efficient coal technologies for worldwide deployment. Innovative coal technologies can help meet the demand for electricity while putting the world on a low-carbon path to keep greenhouse emissions in check. It’s dreadfully needed: 2025 is just 7 years away and there is no plan, only wishful thinking, to replace coal energy with that derived from solar and wind as well as nuclear and hydro.\n— Courtney Young, PhDand QP is the Department Head and Lewis S.

        "prompt": "There are plenty of lawmakers who know next to nothing about technology. Senator Mark Warner isn't one of them. Long before the Virginia Democrat was sworn into the Senate in 2009, Warner built a career in the venture capital and telecom industries. That background has served the senator well since news broke that Facebook, Google, and Twitter all enabled foreign influence campaigns during the 2016 election.\nWarner, who acts as vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has driven much of the conversation around what to do with these giants' unimaginable and unchecked power. He's introduced legislation that would regulate digital political ads and published a 20-point proposal filled with possible fixes. At a hearing with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year, he didn't seem to need any help at all figuring out how to send emails on that WhatsApp doohicky.\nWarner wants badly to work with the tech industry titans, but they haven't made it easy. Zuckerberg had to be all but dragged to Congress, insisting that he wasn't the best-positioned executive to address the company's many failings. But eventually, reluctantly, the head honchos at these companies have begun to come around. That is, Warner says, with one giant exception.\nWhen Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey take their seats at a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, one chair, reserved for Google cofounder Larry Page, may remain empty. The committee extended the invitation to Google CEO Sundar Pichai as well as Page, who is CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, but the company wanted to send senior vice president Kent Walker instead. The committee refused, leaving a glaring hole where one of the biggest internet giants in the world should be.\nA Google spokesperson said Friday that Walker will privately brief members of the committee and Congress this week, but Warner's press secretary confirmed Walker will not be testifying.\nGoogle's refusal to send its most senior executives comes at a particularly fraught time for the company. Over the last week, President Trump and his Republican acolytes turned on the search giant, accusing it—without much evidence—of liberal bias in news results. Meanwhile, reports that Google is building a censored search engine in order to push its way into China have raised alarms both inside the company and on Capitol Hill.\nWIRED spoke with Warner about the search giant's notable absence, the White House's #stopthebias campaign, what to expect from this week's hearings, and his plan to warn American companies of the looming threat posed by China. Below is a lightly edited version of the conversation.\nI’ve lost count of how many hearings there have been in the House and Senate on social media interference since last year. Why will this one be any different?\nI think a lot of folks have done their homework. I don’t think this one has to be about Internet 101. There were some of my colleagues who I don’t even think knew how social media works.\nWhat I’ve told the companies is that I don’t want this to be a retrospective on what happened in 2016, but I want to know what they’re doing to prevent this happening in 2018 and beyond. Increasingly, this kind of manipulation can be used not just in politics, but also in business and other areas.\nI also put out that paper a number of weeks back with a number of suggestions. I thought it was curious I got some saying this is very thoughtful. There were some people at The Wall Street Journal saying this is going to be the end of American innovation. I’d like to hear from [the companies] which of those ideas make sense, which don’t make sense. I know a number of members are interested to know whether Americans should have the right to know whether they’re being contacted by a human or a bot.\nI’m not saying you’re going to eliminate bots, but how do we put some markers in place so we can judge actual volume? Twitter’s been very aggressive on some of the bots.\nWe also need to make sure Americans know that none of this bad action has stopped. The actions of Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter in the last two weeks, taking down other accounts, Russian and otherwise, is really important to note. If we look back at 2016, the Russian active measures campaign was really divided into two buckets. One was a cyberattack on our election system and political parties. The other was the misinformation campaign and disinformation campaign run through social media. What I think is one of the biggest growing problems, and not just on the campaign front, is when you marry a cyber incursion with a disinformation attack.\nIf it had been a foreign actor that hacked into Equifax, and they got your personal information and send you a link and account with your personal information, and you say, \"Oh gosh, I’m going to open this up,\" and then it has a deep fake video of me or a business figure, the ability to combine those two domains to wreak havoc is really important. I’ve not heard how we’re going to get ahead of it.\nGoogle has refused to send one of its top executives to testify, and Congress has refused to let its senior vice president, Kent Walker, appear in his place. How concerned are you by Google’s absence, and if the goal is to get questions answered, why not take whoever they’ll send?\nI know Kent Walker. He’s a good guy. I respect him, but we had the lawyers back in November. This is a hearing that’s going to talk about solutions. I think it speaks volumes that Google doesn’t want to be part of that discussion. I don't think it’s good for them or for coming up with a good solution.\nI was going to ask them why Google is building a search engine for China to allow Chinese censorship. Maybe they don’t want to answer some of those questions. But if Google thinks we’re just going to go away, they’re sadly mistaken. I’ve had a great working relationship with Google over the years, but I’ve been generally surprised that they might not want to be part of the conversation about how we fix this and get solutions.\nIs the possibility of doing business in China something you and your colleagues will be asking Twitter and Facebook about as well this week?\nThat will probably not be as much the subject in this hearing. It's more election security, misinformation, disinformation, and the combination with [cybersecurity]. I am working on a separate effort with a couple Republican colleagues, which we’ll announce at some point soon. I feel like the intelligence community continues to give me all these extraordinary warnings about Chinese influence and Chinese manipulation of equipment. I’m trying to force the intelligence community to either declassify or better combine it. We need to be out making a road show to business leaders, private equity, venture capitalists, and universities. If a bunch of rural communities buy Huawei equipment ... shame on us if there’s any vulnerabilities with their 5G technology. I understand we need to protect sources and methods, but we also make our country more vulnerable if we don’t put these companies on notice.\nWhen you say you’ll be announcing something with your Republican colleagues, do you mean legislation?\nIt would be less a specific piece of legislation and more of a road show to get in front of American leadership and academic leadership in a bipartisan way, to give them a higher-level, sophisticated brief on this challenge.\nThat’s a little different from advising American tech companies that want to work in China.\nThat is a different subject than what we’re talking about on Wednesday. But it’s very important.\nGoogle’s absence comes at a time when President Trump and other lawmakers on the right are raising questions about bias in search. Do you take their concerns about algorithmic bias seriously?\nI think it shows this White House has a remarkable lack of understanding of how search works. There are genuine concerns about some of the algorithms that almost create addiction tendencies, but those are generally about if you have a personal profile of searches, and you search a left-leaning story, they’re going to give you another, usually more extreme story, to keep feeding the beast.\nPart of search is also driven on the volume of hits, and these extreme periodicals on the left and right just don’t have that many eyeballs.\nYou put out a 20-point plan to address some of the biggest problems in tech. A lot of it had to do with bots and foreign influence, for obvious reasons. But one thing I didn’t see in there was how to address these echo chambers that just have people reading increasingly more extreme versions of whatever they already believe. What's your position on that problem?\nThat was obliquely come at from the idea that you can get academic experts that could validate what we all know about this, which is the fact that the algorithm drives you in whatever political direction to a greater extreme. I don’t know what the answer is. Maybe you sign up and say, “I just want an echo chamber,” or can you ask for a service that says for every three stories I read that reflect my position, should I get one thoughtful story on the other side? I’m not suggesting that, which is simplistic, but not hugely hard to implement.\nThat’s one reason I’m so frustrated with Google. We’re not going away. We’re going to come up with some guard posts, and I’m glad Facebook and Twitter are going to be part of the solution. It took them a long time to come to the table. But if [tech companies] don’t help us, and leave this just to Congress, we’re going to screw it up.\nThese companies get lumped into the same category a lot...Big Tech. But they are distinct, and I wonder if you could walk through what your main concerns are with each: Facebook, Google, and Twitter.\nYou’re absolutely right – they often get lumped together, but the concerns with each platform are different. With Facebook, I have real concerns around transparency and user data. As we saw with Cambridge Analytica, users don’t have a clear picture from the company about where and how their data is used. With Twitter, I’m focused on the way they have addressed, or not, issues of abuse, bots, and coordinated behavior, and the extent",
        "baseline": " to which their systems can be gamed by bad actors. And YouTube is an engine of radicalization and disinformation.\nTech money plays a huge role in politics, and tech platforms are incredibly important to political campaigns. Some of the biggest complainers about new restrictions on political ads are the people who buy those ads for members of Congress running for office. Given all that, why should people trust that Congress would ever really regulate tech?\nThat’s why we’re trying to get tech engaged. That’s why your job is to help keep us honest. That’s why we need this debate. That’s why I put out my paper, not with the idea that I’ve got the perfect answer yet, but let me give you a menu of options, let’s see which ones make sense and which ones don’t make sense. Let’s get out of the embarrassing conversations we’ve had in the past.",

(AP) — Third baseman Kris Bryant was reassigned by the Chicago Cubs to their minor league camp on Monday despite an outstanding spring training at the plate, triggering a threat of litigation from the players' association.\nBryant hit .425 in the exhibition season with nine homers and 15 RBIs in 40 at-bats. If the 23-year-old spends 12 or more days in the minor leagues, Chicago would delay him from becoming eligible for free agency by one year, until after the 2021 season, according to baseball's collective bargaining agreement.\n\"Today is a bad day for baseball,\" the Major League Baseball Players Association said in a statement. \"I think we all know that even if Kris Bryant were a combination of the greatest players to play our game, and perhaps he will be before it's all said and done, the Cubs still would have made the decision they made today. This decision, and other similar decisions made by clubs will be addressed in litigation, bargaining or both.\"\nMajor League Baseball defended the Cubs' decision.\n\"In accordance with long established practice under the Basic Agreement, a club has an unfettered right to determine which players are part of its opening-day roster,\" MLB said in a statement. \"This issue was discussed extensively in bargaining in 2011, and the principle was not changed. We do not believe that it is appropriate for the players' association to make the determination that Kris Bryant should be on the Cubs' 25-man roster while another player, who, unlike Bryant, is a member of its bargaining unit, should be cut or sent to the minor leagues.\"\nBryant, who is not on the 40-man roster, was slowed defensively in the middle of camp by right shoulder soreness.\n\"It's always difficult to send young players down because it is news they don't want to hear,\" Cubs President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein said. \"We entered camp with the presumptive move of sending him to Triple-A, and it is always the presumptive move for us with young players who haven't played in the big leagues yet. You see how camp develops and how the roster shapes up to see if there is grounds for an exception to the rule.\"\nBryant was not available to discuss the decision. His agent, Scott Boras, called it \"Ersatz Baseball.\"\n\"MLB is not the MLB without the best players,\" Boras said in a text message to The Associated Press. \"Kris excelled at every level and earned the right of entry. The CBA is at the apogee of wrongs incentivizing clubs to create a product less than best. Bryant's situation is the badge for change to the CBA player service structure.\"\nPreparing for its first season under manager Joe Maddon, the Cubs also optioned second baseman Javy Baez to Triple-A Iowa and reassigned shortstop Addison Russell were assigned to minor league camp.\nThe demotion of Bryant was expected but controversial.\n\"In this case it was the right thing to do,\" Epstein said. \"His performance really mattered, and he made a great first impression on Joe. It demonstrated clearly to everybody that he is really close to not just being in the big leagues but an important role on the team.\"\n\"He is so close to getting it figured out in the batter's box and we feel like Triple-A is the right venue for him to continue making those adjustments and get locked in,\" Epstein said. \"He does everything else so well on the baseball field, he is a winning baseball player. He just has to take that same mindset in the batter's box.\"\nBaez was originally in the lineup against the Giants at Sloan Park on Monday but was replaced by Jonathan Herrera at second base and No. 9 in the lineup shortly before first pitch.\nOne of things Maddon has praised Baez for is how he has stayed focused defensively and on the base paths despite the struggles with the bat.\n\"Whatever happens at the plate happens,\" Baez said Monday morning before learning his fate. \"I don't take whatever happens at the plate to my defense because I have to play good defense for my pitcher and my whole team",
        "baseline": ".\"\nRussell, 21, was acquired from Oakland in the Jeff Samardzija trade on July 5. He hit .324 in 37 at-bats during spring training.\n\"I couldn't tell him what to work on,\" Maddon said. \"He is that accomplished at that age. I asked to him keep doing what he is doing.\"\nEpstein and Maddon both said there were heated debates on the decisions when it came to Baez and Bryant.\n\"In a healthy organization there should be different opinions expressed, bounce ideas off each other, talk about different aspects of the game and how you weigh different variables,\" Epstein said. \"These players were new to Joe so he is seeing them for the first time and we couldn't have had a healthier debate about it and in the end we all agreed. I think I could probably be in this game for a long time and not send down three players that talented on the same day ever again. Those three are pretty good.\"",

Practical training will be provided within the company's departments and sections,' he said.\nHe explained that the 50 students will be employed by Asry according to their qualifications.\nA student will be awarded a certificate on completing the first year and on completing the second year.

Various family members help out, including Hans Mullings Jr., the nephew of the brothers. Hans is not a typical Caribbean name, but Alfred Mullings, the brothers’ father, had studied agriculture in Germany and liked the name.\nThe family arrived in South Florida in the mid-’80s, when Jamaica was unstable. The Mullingses used to run a plant nursery in Kingston but are from St. Ann and St. Mary parishes near Ocho Rio.\nThe brothers hired Allan Plowright as the day chef and Dexter Hinds as the evening chef. Both went to culinary school in Jamaica and worked at Sandals and on cruise ships. Jeremy Mullings studied business at Florida Atlantic University and is a planning consultant for the Department of Transportation and also runs Euro nightclub in Fort Lauderdale with his brother.\nStart the day with a bowl of porridge made with a blend of oats, cornmeal and green banana mixed with condensed milk, vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon, or the national dish of Jamaica: salt fish and ackee. The fish is soaked and shredded dried salt cod, and ackee is a tree fruit that bursts out of a scarlet pod resembling and tasting like soft scrambled eggs. They’re sautéed with onions, black pepper, Scotch bonnet chile and tomato.\nOr try spicy calves’ liver and callaloo, also known as “elephant ears.” They are the heart-shape leaves of the taro tuber and taste like spinach.\nSoups can make a meal here, too. Try red bean soup with yellow yam and oxtail, or chicken and pumpkin, both rib-sticking. Mannish water is goat soup made with the head, feet and organs and seasoned with thyme and scallions.\nEntrees include brown stew chicken, snapper or tofu in a flour-thickened gravy made with soy sauce, scallions, garlic, ginger and peppers.

The paste has crushed allspice, Scotch bonnet, garlic, thyme, salt, pepper and bay leaves, turning black as the sugars bubble and burn over heat, imparting deep flavor.\nTry the jerk wings, chicken or succulent slabs of pork with rice and peas, roast corn, stir-fried cabbage or coleslaw.

        "prompt": "In “The Pink House,” your story in this week’s issue, a young woman moves to Syracuse to get an M.F.A., but discovers that her house is inhabited by a particularly infectious ghost. What do you think the ghost makes of the M.F.A. vs. N.Y.C. debate? Just kidding. Is this the first ghost story you’ve written, and what made you think it would be an appealing form to tackle?\nI’m sure the ghost is fascinated by the N.Y.C. vs. M.F.A. debate, and would add that there’s a literary-world bias toward urban, east-coast writing and toward writing done by the living (as opposed to that done by the undead).\nThis is the second ghost story I’ve written. I wrote a novella that contains ghosts, zombies, and aliens, and an excerpt that features a ghost (who, vaguely like the protagonist in Gabriel García Márquez’s story “The Third Resignation,” is cognizant, but trapped in his grave) was published in The American Reader.\nI’ve wanted for a long time to write a ghost story set in Syracuse, because it is full of abandoned, or just run-down, old Victorian houses, and many are believed to be haunted. It’s a gloomy town, what with the depressed economy and nearly constant cloud-cover. As for the form, I thought it would be fun. There’s something lively about ghost stories—ha!—because the story contains built-in excitement and horror. Of course, you still need to create conflict and a plot, if you’re a traditionalist, but you’re starting on stilts, maybe, because you have a dramatic element that a normal, two-people-drinking-coffee-and-complaining-about-their-bunions story doesn’t have.\nAlso, I grew up around old houses. My grandparents’ house, which stands adjacent to my parents’ house, is a Colonial farmhouse that, in the early eighteen-hundreds, served as the second-to-last station before Canada on the Underground Railroad. I played there almost every day as a child. There was an unknown child’s headstone in the blueberry shed and, in the attic of the main house, a gigantic spinning wheel, an organ, and man-sized urns full of women’s muslin dresses from the eighteen-hundreds, each with more than a hundred tiny buttons down their front. While I never saw a ghost, I felt that they were there—in certain rooms and on certain staircases—and I knew people in town who had haunted houses. I have relatives who have seen ghosts and heard them speak. So writing a ghost story didn’t seem as challenging as it otherwise might have, because I feel that ghosts are just a part of the world.\nAre there ghost stories that you’re particularly fond of, either by other writers or ones you’ve heard by the campfire?\nI love ghost stories. As a kid, I read collections of ghost stories. I loved “Wait Till Martin Comes,” for example, which is about a man taking refuge in an old hut and getting his head bitten off by the largest of a series of three black cats that appear. I loved the Headless Horseman—stuff like that—and Grimm’s Fairy Tales, which are ghosty, in that many feature “spirits” who appear and harm or help out. I love classic ghost novels like “Wuthering Heights,” “Dracula,” “The Turn of the Screw,” and of course Shakespeare’s ghosty plays. I love the ghost stories in “There Once Was a Woman Who Killed Her Neighbor’s Baby,” George Saunders’s ghost stories (or zombie, etc.) in “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline” and “Pastoralia,” Julio Cortazar’s story “House Taken Over,” and Gogol’s “The Overcoat.” I was deep into reading Isaac Bashevis Singer’s collected stories last summer, when I wrote the first draft of this story, and I love them all, but, particularly, the ones about demons possessing and seducing people.\nWhile the core of the story is supernatural, the frame is more mundane—a dinner party given by one resident of an artists’ colony for seven other artists. What kind of",
        "baseline": " narrative opportunities did the juxtaposition of these two settings give you?\nEnvironmental pollution runs through this story—in Syracuse, whose lake is ruined, and in Nebraska, where there are signs with skulls warning against fishing in the river. How does this figure into the ghostly aspects of the story?\nWell, the ghost was killed by exposure to radiation while working at a nuclear power plant. So the story presents a not-subtle message: nuclear radiation can kill! Also, consumption of foods that have absorbed pesticides and of water contaminated by chemicals and industrial runoff can cause cancer. It is probably naïve of me, and annoyingly unrealistic, but I feel the world should get rid of nuclear power plants, all toxic chemicals, the burning of fossil fuels, and, come hell or high water, just find a way to make cleaner energy—wind, solar, geothermal—to provide enough power, fast. My ghost (and the toxicity elements in the story) represent this stereotypically liberal thought.",

        "prompt": "The BBC with much fanfare has been leading its news bulletins all day with the apparent good news that the UK CPI Inflation rate had fallen in mAY to 2.8%, its lowest level for 2.5 years, with it's economics experts and members of the general public presented as painting the news as a highly positive development.\nThe BBC's reporting illustrates the inherent flaw in the mainstream press that it is populated by Journalists who primarily regurgitate the views of vested interests including ivory tower academic economists.\nThe facts are that the UK inflation rate that the BBC and the mainstream press and academics wholly focus on, is in actual fact just a measure of 12 month momentum, what it does not do is give the real picture of the ever present consequences of the Inflation trend.\nInflation coming down and is providing much needed relief.\nLower fuel prices are good news for motorists.\nOn the subject of family and households, it is clearly good news, they have had to put up with very high inflation. much lower pay rises, now that inflation has fallen the squeeze on their budgets will be easing a little bit, and the wider measure of inflation RPI also fell pretty sharply.\nKnow this there is NO good news in today's inflation rate for it has taken the UK to go back into recession for the UK inflation rate to just dip below 3% it's maximum upper limit as evidence of Britain and much of the rest of the western world being in an Inflationary Depression.\nIn fact the inflation fraud is such that in our modern world of continuously improving worker productivity should constantly result in FALLING Prices ! The reason why prices as a whole rarely fall is because of continuous ever persistent government money printing no matter what form it takes, be it printing of debt (government bonds which are NEVER repaid, i.e. total debt level is never cut), or the recent buzz word Quantitative easing, which in reality is Electronic Money Printing in its purest form for unlike debt money it has no economic activity to back its creation and is highly inflationary, highly toxic to the purchasing power of a fiat currency which is why no matter how hard the Bank of England, the government and its BBC propaganda mouth piece tries to fool the general public there is very vicious all consuming in terms of loss of purchasing power of wealth and earnings, EXPONENTIAL Inflation trend in progress.\nThe following graph illustrates the actual EXPOENTIAL INFLATION MEGA-TREND that the people of Britain are exposed to which Government propaganda tries it's hardest to mask from the public by constantly focusing on just momentum that is the annual change.\nThe above graphs show that over the past 5 years your money on the official CPI measure has been eroded by Inflation to the tune of 17.2%!, This IS the reason why your real experience of day to day living expenses does not match government / BBC propaganda. However it is even worse because as I keep mentioning the rate of Inflation is EXPONENTIAL. What this means is that if you stuffed money under your mattress 20 years ago, today it would have been inflated away by 52.5% CPI and on the more recognised measure RPI of 74%, to be worth approaching half its original value.\nThe inflation mega-trend is forcing you to either spend or put it money into a bankrupt bank for a pittance in interest that is TAXED, so that it is near impossible to consistently get a return that is greater than even the official rate of inflation let alone the real rate of inflation that is currently about 4%, as governments continuous tinkering with the methodology to reduce the official inflate rates as you experience when you go to do you weekly shops that usually stands about 1-2% above official CPI.\nI have seen many market / economic / academic, mainstream press, blogosfear commentators write that Inflation or Deflation does not matter, which is usually because they had bought into the academic deflation propaganda many years ago, so having discovered that they are wrong, but are unable to disinvest themselves from what does not work so instead spout nonsense that Deflation or Inflation does not matter, for instance one prominent deflationist - Mish, even goes so far as writing that falling prices are not necessary for Deflation. Which illustrates in one sentence the degree to which the deflation propaganda lunacy continues to persist everywhere, right from the BBC through to the whole media spectrum.\nTo see why it matters go take another look at the above Inflation graph's. Now as an investor what would you do ? Would you bet against these trends such as debt deleveraging deflation mantra fools continue to do, or would you seek out ways to monetize on this rather obvious Inflation Mega-trend ?\nKnow this that the Inflation Mega-trend is not a 50/50 proposition, it is the over-riding trend that drowns out all other trends, which is why as I wrote over 2 years ago in the Inflation Mega-trend ebook (FREE DOWNLOAD) that Deflation can only ever exist as mere ripples on an ocean of Inflation.\nThe only way to protect your wealth from the inflation stealth theft of wealth is to identify where the continuous flood of central bank money printing (Liquidity) will cycle through next, for the past 3 years I have identified this as the stocks stealth bull market (15 Mar 2009 - Stealth Bull Market Follows St",
        "baseline": "ocks Bear Market Bottom at Dow 6,470), and more recently I am seeing preliminary signs (pending in depth analysis) of the exponential flood of fiat currency starting to wash over the UK housing market, first saturating and to eventually overwhelm the deflationary forces that the academics blindly solely focus on in perpetuity.\nThe key point is this that asset prices fluctuate around the exponential inflation mega-trend, these price fluctuations are driven to extremes of market sentiment from manias to depressions. In which respects the UK housing market having experienced its Mania into August 2007 (22 Aug 2007 - UK Housing Market Crash of 2007 - 2008 and Steps to Protect Your Wealth ), has been more recently showing signs of emerging from its depression as the ultimate resolution is always towards a trend towards rising prices as a consequence of the clear and ever present Inflation Mega-trend.\nFor in depth analysis on Inflation Mega-trend aspects and market consequences, ensure you are subscribed to my always free newsletter.",

But the Bills are 4-0 at home this season; only the league-leading Eagles also are spotless in their own stadium.\nUp-and-down Carolina comes off a key division victory against Atlanta and now faces Miami's abysmal offense.

Pittsburgh's defense hasn't allowed a TD on an opening possession in 25 games, the longest active streak in the NFL.\nAn unquestionable lift for the Vikings came this week with Teddy Bridgewater activated. He'll serve as backup to Case Keenum, but his return from a devastating knee injury in training camp 2016 is a huge plus.\nMinnesota is comfy atop the NFC North with a two-game lead and showing lots of balance on offense and defense during a four-game win string.\nThis might look like a mismatch with the Patriots on a four-game winning streak and the Broncos in a four-game slide.\nBeware of that: While New England is seeking a 12th consecutive regular-season road win, which would tie its own AFC record, Bill Belichick is 8-10 against Denver. Tom Brady is 3-7.\nThis is no gimme for the AFC South co-leaders. The Chargers have won six straight in this series, scoring 30 or more points in five of those and outscoring the Jaguars by a combined 116 points.\nCincinnati ranks last in overall offense, so it's lucky that star wide receiver A.J.

He'll start against his former team — Fitz also has played for the Rams, Bengals, Bills, Titans and Texans — and face New York's current journeyman QB, Josh McCown.\nWhile Minnesota appears ready to march off with the NFC North, these also-rans continue the NFL's longest rivalry.\nNot much to recommend here, although the Lions looked solid last week against undermanned Green Bay.

Once people get home from work, they tend to fire up the home computer and use it for personal reasons. All this computer use leaves a lot of people experiencing what the American Optometric Association refers to as “computer vision syndrome.” The good news is that there are preventative measures that can be taken to help keep the problems to a minimum.\nVitamins and minerals. Considering that the eyes have one of the highest energy requirements in the body, it is important that they get proper amounts of vitamins and minerals. Dr. Kondrot recommends that people use Vision Saver Formula, manufactured by Nutritional Research, which offers key antioxidants and ingredients that will help improve the health of the eye and reduce eyestrain.\nHomeopathy. Speak with a practitioner to find a level of therapy that will work for your individual circumstances. One of the most common homeopathic remedies to treat eye strain is Ruta Graveolens. This remedy can greatly reduce the symptoms of eye strain during prolonged computer use.\nBlinking. To help keep the eyes from becoming dry, try to blink often. This will help to keep the eye surface moist and prevent it from drying out. Try opening and closing your eyes in a slower motion, giving your eye more time to become moistened.\nPalming. Close your eyes and gently rest the heels of your hands on your cheekbones, covering your eyes with your palms. Imagine and visualize blackness. At the same time, feel your breathing. Breathe deeply, slowly, and evenly, through your nose. The slower you breathe, the better.\nIncrease the light. Not having a light on when you are using the computer (or television) can put more of a strain on your eyes. Be sure to put a light on, to help reduce the strain.\nCheck the position. The position of your computer can add to your eye strain. It is important that it is positioned a good distance away, around 20-28 inches from the eye, and that there are no glares on it. Re-position your computer to provide maximum eye comfort.\nTake breaks. Even while on the job, it is important to give your eyes a break when using the computer. Ideally, aim for a 15-minute computer break every two hours, and look away from the computer screen for 20",

I kind of tried different things and whatever struck my fancy.\nBut it seemed to be the everyday things that worked for me, talking about an everyday person’s kind of world. I try not to have it be gender specific, or age specific, or parent specific. It could be for anyone. I like to cast a wide net.\nWhen I first started I had no clue what direction to take. All I knew is I loved being a comedian. I had props. I would walk on stage with an old dirty brown bag and I pulled things out … silly stuff … I had some of that. I had some dirty jokes.\nThose were two directions that didn’t work for me. There are a lot of much funnier prop comedians out there. And there are a lot of comedians out there who are better at being dirty than I am. I was always fairly clean, even when I started. I’ve always been 95 percent clean anyway. I had off-color jokes but on a night when I happened to not do any dirty stuff, the reaction from the shows was different than when I included those kinds of jokes and more people kept coming back.\nIt’s as if families send out clean scouts and they come back with Aunt Edna, like they are reporting to people who can’t handle dirty comedy.\nIJ: How did you start your career in comedy?\nBR: I was in college when I hit on the idea.\nFor me, it was literally thrilling just to even put that in my head that I wasn’t going to be an accountant when I woke up every day. Those days of going to accounting class were not fun.\nWhen I began my quest to be a comedian, I thought, “This is fun.” I had no clue how to hit it, but the target was thrilling.\nWhen I decided I wanted to be a comedian in college, this was before computers, before the wheel, before fire. I was at a small Midwestern college. A guy down that hall had a radio, and that was like, ‘Wow!’ So I don’t think I was horribly influenced, because I wasn’t able to listen to anybody else.\nWhen I first started it was a little bizarre. I was sort of funny off stage and able to make my friends laugh but I’m very capable of not being funny.\nWhen people don’t know what I do and ask what I do, I used to hate where that would lead. If you say you’re a comedian and you haven’t been funny for the first 10 minutes of the conversation they look at you like you’re from another planet.\nIJ: What was it that drew you to comedy?\nBR: There’s math involved and science involved and the fact that you’re trying to extract a physical response from people through the formulation of words and thoughts and ideas.\nIt’s fun to tinker around with a joke and change a word here or there, or putting a beat in or beat out and playing with timing.\nThe way some people feel about working on a car engine is similar to how I feel about jokes. It’s even the combination of gut feelings, and getting instant feedback, letting the audience let you know whether your gut was on track. … That’s what’s really cool, to get on stage and try it in a new or different way and the audience will tell you through their laughs, or lack of laughs. And when you get it, that feedback helps guide the next joke.\nIJ: You dropped out of college to pursue your career in comedy, to very successful results. But then you went back and finished your degree. Why bother?\nBR: It was always sort of an empty feeling in my life. Like a piece of the jigsaw puzzle was missing and I had put so much effort",

I have a lazy side to my personality.\nI like to work hard, too. But comedy lets me do both. I’ve got a one-hour show each night but I can also sleep in a lot. What would I change? I’m not at a level where I’m in the public eye a whole lot but one thing I would change in entertainment is how the media can be mean-spirited toward certain celebrities.\nI don’t like seeing someone get ripped to shreds, and for someone to take a gleeful approach to watching a young lady have a meltdown in life is not funny.",

(AP) -- Wisconsin veterans who had been urging Gov. Scott Walker to veto a bill affecting asbestos exposure lawsuits are backing down after being told the governor plans to sign the measure.\nJason Johns, lobbyist for the Military Order of the Purple Heart of Wisconsin, said Monday that he emailed veterans telling them to curtail their effort after a Walker aide told another veteran the governor planned to sign the bill.\nWalker's spokeswoman Laurel Patrick says Walker continues to evaluate the measure.\nRepublican proponents argue the goal is to stop those bringing asbestos exposure lawsuits from being able to double dip by suing businesses and trusts established to pay claims. But opponents say new requirements will delay and deny justice for those harmed by asbestos, including veterans.\nUPDATED Thursday, March 20, 2014 --- 6:36 p.m.\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A bill opponents say would deny justice to people exposed to asbestos has passed the Wisconsin Assembly.\nVeterans are among the most vocal opponents of the measure passed on a party line 55-38 vote Thursday. The bill now heads to Gov. Scott Walker.\nThe heavily lobbied proposal would require plaintiffs who have suffered from asbestos exposure to reveal how many businesses their attorneys plan to sue. They would also have to go after money from an asbestos trust before they could sue for more in court.\nProponents argue it is needed to prevent filing multiple claims against both trust funds set up to pay victims of asbestos exposure as well as individual businesses.\nDemocrats argue the changes would make it more difficult for people harmed by asbestos to collect damages.\nUPDATED Thursday, March 20, 2014 --- 6:39 a.m.\nMADISON, Wis.

Veterans groups and other asbestos victim advocates took a stand Monday against Assembly Bill 19, asking Governor Walker and the State Assembly to stop the measure. They say the bill would delay and deny justice to asbestos victims by requiring plaintiffs to reveal how many businesses their attorneys plan to go after.\nRuth Grosz, whose husband died from mesothelioma, explained how the ordeal has changed her life forever. \"Instead of giving veterans like my husband, their day in court, and hold corporations responsible, this bill would shield those corporations from liability,\" she said.\nThe Senate passed the bill last week and the assembly was expected to vote on the final version Thursday.

They argued that these job protections caused such harm to students that the rules violated their constitutional rights. Making it easier to fire bad teachers, the attorneys said, would not only improve academic performance, but would narrow the achievement gap that separates white, Asian and wealthier students from their lower-income, black and Latino peers.\nAt trial, students testified about teachers who belittled or ignored them, while plaintiff experts asserted that such instruction left students behind, unable to catch up.\nThis testimony bowled over the trial court judge, who in 2014 threw out the job protections, saying that the damage to students \"shocks the conscience.\"\nBut in April, a three-judge court of appeal panel shrugged off the claims of harm and said it was up to the Legislature to set education policy, including the regulations in question.\nMonday's high court decision was about whether justices would hear arguments and weigh in. Their 4-3 split against doing so may well reflect the level of contention over how best to improve education.\n\"This has been such a polarized issue,\" said Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla (D-Concord.).\nBonilla tried to craft compromise legislation that eventually was abandoned by teachers unions and their critics.\n\"Unfortunately, on one side, we had the California Teachers Assn. that is satisfied with the status quo,\" Bonilla said. \"On the other side, you had many people interested in making changes to education but … if they couldn't have everything in a bill, they weren't going to support my bill. That's not a realistic perspective in terms of how policy is crafted.\"\nAlthough Vergara backers could not get around union clout in the Legislature, they had access to money and a crack team of attorneys.\nThe lawsuit challenged five statutes that in combination, it argued, violated the constitutional rights of students. These laws grant the protections of tenure to teachers after two years on the job. They stipulate that teacher layoffs, when they occur, must be based primarily on seniority. And they set up a dismissal process for instructors that is more lengthy and difficult than for many other state employees.\nThe effort was a \"Hail Mary pass,\" said Michael Petrilli, president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"You throw a Hail Mary pass when you're out of other options. The reformers in California turned to it because the Legislature was locked up by unions.\"\nThe Legislature remains the most logical place to determine such employment rules, some advocates on both sides said.\n\"This was an appropriate move by the Supreme Court and really a victory for the idea of a separation of powers as it relates to education-policy matters,\" said Mark Paige, an assistant professor in public policy at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. \"The trial court decision was an example of an activist court. The opinion lodged the trial court in the middle of a policy matter.\"\n\"I don't think it means the end of the tenure war,\" Paige said. \"My hunch is that it won't be in California, given the state's more liberal leanings.\"\nThe state Supreme Court's four-member majority did not issue an opinion, which isn't required for a case that won't get review. Three justices wanted to hear the case, and two of them issued dissenting statements saying important issues of law were at stake.\nThe court majority, however, accepted the logic of Division Two Presiding Justice Roger W. Boren, who wrote in April for the court of appeal: \"The court's job is merely to determine whether the statutes are constitutional, not if they are 'a good idea.'\"\nThe appeals panel did not challenge evidence that many students are ill served in California public schools. But the judges said the laws being questioned were not necessarily responsible.\nThat logic bodes poorly for future court challenges in California or elsewhere, said Eric A. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution of Stanford University, who testified on behalf of the Vergara plaintiffs.\n\"Courts don't make policy decisions except in extreme cases and California is an extreme case,\" he said. And \"even in the worst case, the courts aren't stepping up.\"\nBut plaintiff's attorney Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. insisted that the disagreement of three Supreme Court justices on Monday suggests a path forward.\nThe two justices who posted statements said the findings of the trial judge should have received more deference. Both concluded that the appeals panel set too high a barrier for considering the merits of the claims.\n\"Because the questions presented have obvious statewide importance, and because they involve a significant legal issue on which the Court of Appeal likely erred, this court should grant review,\" wrote Justice Goodwin H. Liu. \"There is considerable evidence in the record to support the trial court's conclusion that the hiring and retention of a substantial number of grossly ineffective teachers in California public schools have an appreciable impact on students' fundamental right to education.\"\nBoutros said that reasoning provides \"a launching pad.\"\n\"The door is open to bring other suits in state court and federal court,\" he said.\nThe group Students Matter, which funded the lawsuit and recruited the students and their families, said it will continue to push for legislative change in Sacramento. It also is pressing its reform agenda on other fronts. In another lawsuit, the group is trying to force several school systems to use standardized test scores in teacher evaluations.\nStudent Matters has access to a network of philanthropists and foundations willing to bankroll its business-inspired vision of education reform.\nNationally, Vergara-like legal challenges are being pursued in New York and Minnesota. Neither appears close to resolution.\nWhat will carry the day, Boutros said, is public opinion.\n\"If you talk to any rational person on the street about the issues, they're going to agree with us,\" he said.\nSome in his camp are talking about a ballot initiative as a next logical step to limit job protections, although unions defeated such an attempt in the past.\nRandi Weingarten",

Schools, she said, need smaller classes, an influx of new teachers and more generous, secure funding.\nThe backers of Vergara, she said, make it harder to promote effective change \"because they pretend there are simple silver-bullet solutions — that you can fire, threaten or sanction your way to helping children succeed.\"\nAug. 23, 11:25 a.m.: This article was updated to bring higher up the first reference to the court's decision.\nAug. 22, 8:30 p.m.: This article was updated throughout with additional background and comments.\n5:17 p.m.: This article was updated throughout with additional reaction and background.\n12:20 p.m.: This article was updated with reaction to the court decision and background information.\nThis article originally was published Aug. 22 at 11:40 a.m.",

These have repeatedly shown to be successful in both research and practice. If you work with clients, students or employees you’ll benefit from these favored strategies!\nReflect at the end of the day and write down 3 things that went well and why they went well. This helps overcome gratitude adaptation/habituation and increases the salience of good acts.\nComplete the VIA Survey and identify your highest strengths. Choose one of your top strengths and use it in a new way each day for one week.\nWrite a letter of gratitude to someone you have not previously thanked. I appropriate, meet the person and read the letter.\nTake a few minutes each day to bring your full and complete attention to something you are doing: for example, walking, eating, listening, breathing. Then, read and follow the 5 mindfulness tips that no one tells you about when building a meditation practice.\nWrite down a goal you want to reach that is consistent with your life values. Write down your plan of action for reaching that goal: What are 2 specific steps you can do this week to make progress on your goal?\nImagine a future in which you are bringing your best possible self forward. Visualize a “best possible self” that is very pleasing to you and that you are interested in. Make note of the character strengths that you’ll need to deploy to make this best possible self a reality.\nThink of a specific time, recently or a while back, when you were at your best — really feeling and behaving at a high level. You felt like you were your authentic self, being who you are. Share the “story” of this experience with someone important in your life.\nLoving-kindness meditation involves generating positive emotions of love in the present moment. Most common forms include the use of loving imagery and positive statements. Learn the specifics about using this approach of heartfulness.\n9. Count your kind acts or pay kindness forward.\nCount the acts of kindness you perform each day and track them so that you can report the total by the end of the week. Or, take notice when someone does something deliberately kind for you; pay the kindness forward by being kind to 3 people that day.\nOne of my personal favorites. Reflect each day for 2-3 minutes on two pleasurable experiences and allow/make the pleasure last as long as possible.\nRemember, these research studies are done on groups of people so not every strategy works for every person in the study or for every person reading this blog. But, they are popular for a reason…they tend to work for a lot of people. It is very likely that if you give each one a try, you will gravitate to certain exercises and will benefit.\nTaking action should be your top priority.

        "prompt": "Showing up means shedding the impact of society and bringing all that you are into all that you do.\nThis past June, the world was dealt two blows, when iconic entrepreneurs Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain took their own lives. Here we are four months later on World Mental Health Day, and while there seems to be a rise in global conversations about mental health and collective steps being taken to remove the stigma surrounding the disease, there is still a lot more work to be done.\nAccording to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA), approximately 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety. In addition, a study by the ADAA indicates that 16.1 million Americans suffer from Major Depression.\nGiven the headlines and statistics (women are diagnosed twice as often as men), we're also starting to pay much closer attention to the emotional and psychological toll entrepreneurship takes on female founders.\nI spoke with Dr. Lauren Hazzouri, psychologist and champion for girls and women, speaker, and founder of Hazzouri Psychology, about some of the lifestyle changes that female entrepreneurs can make to help ease some of the feelings of anxiety and depression — and what we can do collectively, to help each other.\nBefore we dive in, here's a disclaimer from Hazzouri: “Entrepreneurial lifestyle patterns certainly do not cause mental health concerns, though they may contribute to them. The first action toward emerging — regardless of symptoms and/or diagnosis — is making a change. Remember that our bodies and our brains require daily maintenance. Getting your body working for you rather than against you helps level the playing field, so we can see what remains for us to tackle on the emotional front.\"\nExercise regularly: Exercise is important for everyone, but for those with mood concerns and/or anxiety, it’s critical. Research suggests that a 30-minute run gives us the same boost in serotonin levels (the brain chemical that makes you feel good) that we could expect from a low dose of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) like Zoloft or Prozac.\nIf you’re not ready to join a co-working space, see if there are female entrepreneurs in your network that you can plan “co-working days” with, if only for motivation and human connection IRL.\nTake control of your thoughts: Mark down your thoughts, feelings, and the situation or possible triggers. Hazzouri explains: \"Whenever you’re feeling anxious, afraid, uncomfortable, uneasy, or sad, write it down. Each one of us has both a positive and a negative thought voice. The negative voice is the part of you that has internalized all of the warped messages thrown at you by society since birth and works overtime to shame you into fitting in with societal norms. Society fuels self-destructive thoughts. Thoughts lead to feelings, and feelings lead to actions. To change the way you feel (a.k.a., less than), change the way you think. Identify thought patterns that lead to unwanted feelings. Thoughts are not facts, so show your negative thoughts who's boss. Write them down. Replace them with truth. Get on with your day. Remember, each one of us came with everything we need to get through this life in a healthy and happy way.\"\nCome together & build your tribe: \"Remember, we are better together. You're not alone. When we come together and stand in our power",
        "baseline": ", there’s no stopping us. Reach out to your squad, tribe, coven. Share. Connect. Repeat. \"\nSupport entrepreneurs by offering discounted fitness rates: Hazzouri continues: “As a society, we can also offer discounts on gym memberships and sports leagues for entrepreneurs, taking a lead from the education system. For example, when children or adolescents are home schooled, they are encouraged to engage in the extra-curricular sports, arts programs, clubs, and other school activities provided by their home school district. Once we graduate, our human need for connection doesn’t decrease, yet organized opportunities do. So, it’s important for entrepreneurs to integrate being human and being successful, according to society’s standards. This can help decrease the feelings of isolation often felt by entrepreneurs.\"\nAnd to the female founder who's unsure about seeking help or treatment, or talking about her struggles, because she fears it might harm her public persona?",

Crews are still putting the finishing touches on the 6,800-square-foot eatery.\nRehab of the restaurant began in 2014 along with the hotel. The general contractors for the project were St. Clair Shores-based Columbia Construction Services and Detroit-based ROK Construction. The designer was Detroit-based architecture firm Patrick Thompson Design LLC.\nWalker said his goal is to make Red Dunn a destination restaurant.\n\"We want to be a standalone eatery,\" he said. \"We're not 'in' the hotel, we're adjacent to it.\"\nThe restaurant scene has boomed recently in certain areas of Detroit, including Corktown, which is good for foodies and the industry generally, but it also means stronger competition. Walker said there's one thing missing in the city's restaurants that he intends to correct.\n\"I feel like culinary creativity has developed faster in Detroit than service standards,\" he said. \"There's some catching up to do and that's the mission we're on.\"\nThe restaurant is elegant but not quite fine dining. Walker and Chef Jay Gundy are steering away from the tapas, small-plate shareables, and focusing on hardier portions of \"Detroit-style American cuisine,\" Walker said. Dishes are seasonal and made from scratch, using local produce when possible.\nGundy is a Detroit native who has cooked at many well-known area establishments, such as The Whitney,",

        "prompt": "For the past year, oil and gas companies have been faced with an increasingly difficult situation. Oil prices have plunged from over $100 per barrel in July 2014 to under half that at times this year. Some analysts predict prices will remain low, or could dive even lower.\nTo help weather the storm, some companies are turning to big data and analytics.\nPart of the drop in prices has come from the spike in oil production. The US has gone from pumping 5.4 million barrels a day in 2009 to 8.7 million last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nA big reason for the transformation has been the rise of fracking, the process of shooting water into rock and impenetrable sands to extract hard to reach oil.\nToday's low oil prices make it increasingly important for customers to embrace Industrial Internet technologies to increase uptime and maximize production. A more digitally connected environment means better asset management and more productivity across every asset. A 1% improvement in capital utilization for upstream oil and gas exploration and development could total $90 billion in avoided or deferred capital expenditures.\nThese fracking operations have been the hardest hit from the drop in oil prices. The price has dropped below break-even prices for many of the operations in the US shale basins, and some experts are saying that half of the industry could disappear by the end of the year. And a report from Wood McKenzie estimated that if oil stays below $50 a barrel this year, $1.5 trillion of all US oil projects will lose money.\nFiber optics were originally a military technology, dating back to the 1960s. The technology has been used since the 1990s in oil and gas drilling, but recent developments have brought the technology back to the forefront.\nIn the past, most fiber optic cables for energy companies were unreliable. Putting the cables deep in the ground exposed them to extreme heat, pressure and moisture, causing deterioration. Their short lifespans made them less valuable and usable.\nAdditionally, the length of the cables prevented robust readings from the deepest points of well. This becomes a problem as fracking wells can extend hundreds of thousands of feet below the surface and draw oil laterally from as far away as 6000 feet.\nNowadays, the strength of the cables has improved, and the applications have expanded, said Trent Jacobs at the Journal of Petroleum Technology.\n\"It has been an impressive comeback for a technology that once stood on the brink of failure,\" wrote Jacobs. \"The upstream oil and gas industry has largely resolved crippling technical challenges that shortened the life of fiber-optic cables in downhole applications and is now working on a big encore.\"\nNow firms such as OptaSense can use cables to sense a vast amount of information. According to the company, they can run up to 30 miles of cables with 4000 sensors to help companies get a better sense of what is happening.\nIn fact, these developments have allowed the fiber-optic market to grow quickly in the last few years.\nAccording to Information Gatekeepers and Light Wave Ventures, the fiber-optic sensor market has gone from under $200 million in 2006 to around $600 million today. The market is expected to nearly triple again in the next 3 years, to $1.5 billion in 2018, with 70% of that spending coming from oil and gas.\nPreviously, fiber optics were used to detect temperature changes that indicated the existence of oil or gas in an area. Now new capabilities have expanded their uses.\n\"With distributed fiber optic sensing, by analyzing the laser-light reflections from different spots in the fiber, the temperature and strain of the glass can be determined at any point in the well, and the fiber can be turned into a series of distributed microphones or hydrophones,\" wrote Glenn R. McColpin of Halliburton's Pinnacle in the American Oil and Gas Reporter.\nThere's a lot of complicated science going into fiber's new uses, but according to Pinnacle, which offers their own selection of fiber-optic sensors, the basic idea is that the cables shoot lasers into the rock and feedback helps them detect cracks where oil may be hiding.\nBy analyzing this feedback data, those working the wells can focus their efforts and find oil they may have otherwise missed. \"Operators can actually 'see' and 'hear' where fluid and proppant are moving along each individual meter of the well,\" said McColpin.\nFrom there, operators can adjust",
        "baseline": " how they go after the oil and maximize the potential of these wells. Companies can even extend the life of an older well that would otherwise be abandoned, which is huge considering that Halliburton estimates drilling a new well costs around $8 million.\nIn one instance, Schlumberger, an oilfield services giant, was able to use this technology to help BP extract millions of gallons of oil.\n\"BP was developing a portion of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) oil field in the Caspian Sea offshore Azerbaijan. The main producing formations consisted of layers of sandstone interbedded with shale,\" said Schlumberger in a case study. \"More than 100 million barrels of secondary production were at risk of being bypassed because of the reservoir's characteristics.\"\nInstead of leaving the oil untapped, the company was able to install fiber-optic sensors to monitor both temperature and pressure helping to reach the oil that would have otherwise gone unused.",

On intercontinental trade, Dubai benefits from a diversified market, with fall-offs in traffic in one region partly compensated for by more robust markets elsewhere,\" Ali said.\n\"We have brought about a radical change in the local maritime sector through an extensive range of industry initiatives and regulations which support the industry's smart transformation,\" he added.\nThe UAE launched the Innovation Quay, which encourages leading manufacturers and research institutions to conduct field studies and create new experiences using the latest innovative technologies such as drones, 3D technology, and smart and self-driving ships, among others.\nDubai was recently named one of the top five in the International Shipping Centre Development Index and one of the world's five most competitive and attractive maritime clusters.\nIn Dubai, the maritime industry has made immense economic contributions. Hosting over 5,500 and rising companies performing over 13,000 marine-based activities, the local industry went up by 25 per cent from 2011 to 2015 and now accounts for 7 per cent of the emirate's gross domestic product. Moreover, over 76,000 maritime jobs now support Dubai's steadily-growing economy. This confirms Dubai's continuing success in becoming one of the most globally competitive, distinguished and comprehensive maritime centres in the world.\nThe sector's contribution to Dubai's GDP is at Dh26.9 billion or 7 per cent of the total.\nEng Ali Al Suwaidi, general manager of Dubai Maritime City, said the UAE is considered regional hub for having the world's top shipowners and services companies.\n\"The local maritime sector has tremendous potential, and we continue to strive and focus on developing the growth opportunities, specifically within the shipping sector. The UAE government has also shown a huge support to both local and private sectors in maritime industry through facilitating their business and encouraging more international investment. We can foresee significant opportunities in the marine segment with development potential, in the areas of maritime services, construction, maintenance and berthing facilities. With increased business connectivity overall, there is a lot of potential for future initiatives to thrive,\" Al Suwaidi said.\nKhamis Buamim, group CEO and managing director of Gulf Navigation Holding, said the UAE's ports occupy an ideal and strategic location, making them rank higher as the preferred and most important routes for maritime trade. Ports in Dubai continue to provide integrated services that strengthen the national economy as a whole.\n\"With the changes in the industry overall, in addition to rising demands, new companies within the sector must diversify into all aspects of logistics and leisure, open up new employment opportunities and promote innovative initiatives to promote a more sustainable economy. This will further enable shipping stakeholders to tackle the current challenges we face and grasp more opportunities for future advancement; enabling the marine sector to lead globally,\" Buamim said.\nEng Mohammed Zaitoun, president and CEO of Zaitoun Green Shipping, stated that the maritime industry is fast becoming increasingly competitive.\n\"We foresee the sector moving towards a future that is well connected, fostering more opportunities for innovation, collaboration and knowledge sharing. Thus, it is vital that efficiency of the vessels is maintained and enhanced. Optimizing operations of current vessels by lowering carbon emissions and quickly adapting to changing demands through digitisation and technological solutions; is the fastest way to drive future growth,\" he said.\nZaitoun stressed that the importance of any port for any ship owner will be depending on the availability of compliance fuel to 2020 sulfur rules as well attractive price, therefore the ports has to build integration link",
        "baseline": " between their operational process and compliance fuel.\nSuha Obaid, deputy CEO at Folk Shipping, said in Dubai alone, there are more than 5,500 firms operating within the maritime sector, contributing 7 per cent to the GDP and providing an estimated 75,000 domestics jobs - signifying its importance to Dubai's economy.\nTo remain progressive, he said, the shipping industry currently requires adherence to the changing laws and regulations, and needs more banks as investors to look into it seriously.\n\"We are in the age of rapid digitisation, which can pose several challenges to the traditional means of doing businesses and can disrupt current ship operating procedures. In order to flourish, the sector needs to adapt readily to the new innovative technologies being implemented globally. Reliance on technology will not only increase connectivity but will also serve to maximize the vessels' operating potential, optimize costs and enabling ship owners to make more informed decisions to remain competitive in an increasingly challenging and commoditised marketplace,\" Obaid said.",

        "prompt": "Phil Mickelson calls Ryder Cup course rough \"almost unplayable,\" says similar setups are \"a waste of my time\"\nThe most surprising part about Phil Mickelson criticizing the setup of Le Golf National for the 2018 Ryder Cup is that it took this long. Mickelson lost both his matches in the biennial event—badly—but waited until a strong opening round in Napa on Thursday to express his distaste for what he called \"unplayable\" rough in France.\n\"The fact is they had brutal rough, almost unplayable, and it's not the way I play,\" Mickelson told reporters following a first-round 65 at the Safeway Classic, the first event of the 2018-'19 PGA Tour season. \"I don't play like that. And here I can miss the fairways, i can get shots out of the rough up on the green and it's playable.\"\nBut Mickelson, never known to shy away from offering his opinion, didn't stop there.\n\"And I'm 48. I'm not going to play tournaments with rough like that anymore, it's a waste of my time. I'm going to play courses that are playable and that I can play aggressive, attacking, make a lot of birdies, style of golf I like to play.\"\nMickelson was one of four captain's picks Jim Furyk chose for the event. Lefty arrived in Paris in a bit of a slump and only played in one of four team sessions, a foursome 5-and-4 loss with partner Bryson DeChambeau in which the pair was 7 down to Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren at the turn. Mickelson also lost, 4 and 2, to Francesco Molinari, who went 5-0 during the event, in a Sunday singles match that ended when Mickelson hit his tee shot in the water on the par-3 16th hole. After his ball splashed, Mickelson turned to Molinari and conceded the match, which also gave Europe the victory.\nIt was a question that involved that watery shot and Mickelson's turnaround on Thursday, that prompted his rant about the rough, which began with him acknowledging the Europeans setting up the course to their liking—and some math involving Ben Hogan.\n\"Well, it's a unique situation in that the way the—the Europeans did a great thing, they did the opposite of what we do when we have the Ryder Cup here,\" Mickelson said. \"The",
        "baseline": " fairways were 14- to 16-yards wide. Ben Hogan, who is the greatest ball-striker of all time, had a 5 percent margin of error. So if you hit the ball 300 yards, which we all hit it more than that, you need to have a 30-yard wide fairway to be able to hit it.\"\nMany believed Mickelson wasn't the best choice to round out Team USA on a golf course that put a premium on accuracy. Mickelson's comments only bolster that argument.\nThey're also the latest example of what has been a messy week for Furyk's squad following the loss. Patrick Reed was critical of Furyk and Jordan Spieth, and there were reports of confrontations between the team's top two ranked players, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which Koepka has subsequently denied. The U.S. officially lost 17½-10½, but with each passing day the result seems more lopsided.",

        "prompt": "Just days before it launches its XtremIO flash array, EMC is suing flash array startup Pure Storage for allegedly improperly recruiting EMC staff, and also accuses it of encouraging ex-EMCers to use its confidential data – and it has cited The Register in its complaint.\nIt has also accused Pure of interference with its business relationships, alleging it had \"directed Former Employees' use of EMC Confidential Information in soliciting customers\".\nPure Storage sells its FlashArray product to speed up networked array data access and has identified EMC, with its disk drive based VNX and VMAX arrays, as its primary competitor.\nHopkinton-based EMC has filed its suit in Massachusetts District Court PDF, demanding a jury trial and “double, treble and/or punitive damages” if judgment is found in its favour.\nThe lawsuit essentially accuses Pure of recruiting \"valuable\" \"high-impact\" EMC sales staff to sell its products – allegedly using confidential information which EMC claims was \"stolen\" from it contrary to clauses in its former employees' Key Employee Agreements (KEAs).\nDozens of former EMC employees have joined Pure Storage and stolen tens of thousands of pages of proprietary, highly confidential and competitively sensitive EMC materials – including highly specific information about EMC’s directly competing flash storage solution, EMC’s strategies to implement and sell that solution, and targeted, detailed information about EMC’s customers and their buying patterns.\nIt says 44 of its employees have joined Pure since August 2011 and describes how it believes certain employees removed confidential data, alleging that in two cases they had used EMC's own file synchronisation and share product, Syncplicity – a product designed as a secure Dropbox-style sync-'n'-share.\nEMC details evidence that Pure sees EMC as its main competition, which is where El Reg comes in. The filing cites quotes given to The Register by Pure's President David Hatfield.\nSimilarly, a recent Forbes article titled “Pure Storage Targets EMC, Streaks to IPO with $250 Million Capital Infusion” makes clear that EMC is Pure Storage’s primary target.\nThe suit against former staffer Chad Johnson came to light just over a week ago.\nEMC names 32 ex-employees, mostly sales reps, who have joined Pure in its suit.\nPure Storage CEO Scott Dietzen has blogged about this, saying: \"We at Pure believe there is no merit whatsoever to any of these complaints. We have the resources ... and intend to defend",
        "baseline": " ourselves vigorously against these allegations.\"\nHe adds: \"We believe in employee freedom and in hiring the very best, but at the same time, we have a strong policy against the use of any third party confidential information; that is, we believe all employees— including our own and those of our competitors — should be free to follow their dreams and support their families as they see fit, provided they honor their lawful commitments and safeguard IP from prior employers.\"\nDietzen points out: \"At Pure we don’t put non-compete clauses in our employee agreements – we simply don’t believe in them.\"\nHe adds this: \"Based upon our present understanding, I am wholly confident that Pure Storage and all of our employees have been behaving ethically, and that these charges will be proven to be without merit.\"\nDietzen seems in little doubt that EMC's suit is timed to help its XtremIO flash array product launch, expected on 14 November.",

        "prompt": "Author Adam Minter explains the growing pressures on recycling that ultimately point back to you, the consumer.\nFebruary 15, 2016, 1:47 p.m.\nMany people in the green world have a love/hate relationship with recycling and worry about whether it really does any good. Matt recently wrote about how people are carefully separating their glass bottles, only to have them crushed and sent to the landfill. Some worry that it's just a feel-good exercise that might even increase waste. In a review of \"Junkyard Planet\" by Adam Minter, I wrote about how he considers recycling to be the worst of the 3Rs.\nThe crisis has been coming for a while as the recycling market changes.\nThere’s no question that the commodities slump has had a harsh impact on recyclers. But it’s important to recognize that the slump also serves to highlight many problems that high prices allowed the industry to ignore for far too long. For example, much of the U.S. municipal recycling infrastructure is designed to sort two-dimensional recyclables such as newsprint and office paper. But as we all know, newsprint is in significant decline. As a result, so are the profits that many recyclers were accustomed to deriving from it. Meanwhile, the recycling stream is becoming dominated more and more by three-dimensional recyclables like detergent containers and water bottles. Technology exists to sort them, but it’s expensive and requires rethinking business models, and that’s something better done when you’re making money, not losing it. Alas, recyclers are human, and many assumed — incorrectly! — that the waste stream would remain static, and high commodity prices weren’t cyclical but rather permanent. The other problem is that recycling has become lighter — meaning, for the sake of cost and material savings, cans and bottles are becoming thinner and lighter. That’s good for the environment, but bad for recyclers who demand more, not less, to be profitable.\nThis was noted in an earlier post on TreeHugger, how the bottle manufacturers have been making bottles with much less plastic; now the bottles are so light that they're harder to separate. (They used to stay put when compressed air was used to separate paper from plastic.) The recyclers are handling the same number of pieces but getting less material out of the deal.\nAt the same time, many recyclers simply assumed that the Chinese markets for their goods were permanent, and failed to anticipate or heed warnings from China that it was no longer interested in importing low-quality U.S. recyclables. When the door slammed shut on those exports in 2012 (during “operation Green Fence”), many U.S. recyclers were left with nowhere to go with their product. Had they made better quality bales of recyclables, that might not have been a problem (long-term, they’ll need U.S. manufacturers who want their recyclables).\nThe NYT article focused on plastics, which is understandable. It’s hard for recyclers to compete with virgin producers — right now. But ironically, plastics is the recycling sector that’s receiving the most R&D right now, and there are some really incredible innovations in the pipeline to help sort plastics from the other recyclables in your bin, as well as some interesting technologies to help transform old plastics into new. It’s always dicey to bet on innovation, but I’d be very surprised if technology didn’t improve the plastics recycling yield over the next decade. I think it’s all but inevitable.\nFinally, Minter looks at what we're recycling and how we're doing. I thought the 34 percent recycling rate quoted in the New York Times article was a sign of failure, given that it was just slightly over double what it was in 1990, but in fact much has changed, and it's actually pretty good.\nUltimately, I think Americans need to stop thinking about recycling in terms of how much is being diverted from landfills. A recycling rate of 34% in 2006 is not the same as a recycling rate of 34% in 2016. The current 34%, in fact, is really impressive, considering that our trash and recycling is becoming substantially lighter due to the use of plastics and thinner packaging. In effect, we’re running faster to stand still.\nBut maybe we're thinking about it all wrong.\nIf we really want to measure the impact of recycling, I think a carbon-based model is the best route. So, instead of saying, we diverted 34% from",
        "baseline": " landfills, we instead say “We saved X tons of CO2 by opting to recycle instead of landfilling or X tons of CO2 instead of incinerating.” The advantages are several, including the obvious boon of avoiding environmentally unsound recycling practices. (Why divert from the landfill if there’s no net CO2 benefit? Maybe keeping it out of the landfill is reason enough, but having that kind of data helps us make better decisions.) Doing so will require complicated and expensive life cycle assessments of products in our waste stream. But long-term, it’ll help everyone make much better, informed choices about recycling.\nEven if you've never thought about it before, Minter's insights make the topic interesting. To learn more, I highly recommend \"Junkyard Planet.\"\nShould cities ban disposable cups and plates?\nAre you a recycling master?\nAuthor Adam Minter explains the growing pressures on recycling that ultimately go back to the consumer.",
        "llm_baseline": "the landfill s,or we should say that we reduced our carbon footprint by 34%..That’s a much more meaningful metric,and it’s one that we can all agree on..",
        "llm_senso_medium": "the landfill,the question should be,have we reduced our carbon footprint by 34%.That’s what we’llbe doing in the future,and that’s the thing that will really drive our recycling forward.",
        "llm_acro_medium": "the landfill,I would say,we reduced our carbon footprint by 34 percent.That’s a much more sustainable reduction,and it’s one that we can all understand.Of course,we can’t measure the carbon footprint of every piece of trash we throw away,but we can measure the carbon footprint of every piece of trash we recycle.Recycling is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint,and it’s a great way to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.For all of those reasons,I think we should be proud of the'ingenuity of the recycling recycling industry',and we should also be proud of the fact that we’re diverting more and more trash from the landfill every day.The fact that we’re doing this with less and less material is a testament to the ingenuity of our recycling recycling industry,and it’s a testament to the ingenuity of the recycling recycling industry....

Currently it’s based around LinkedIn, but this will be expanded to other social media sites soon. The real people reviews allow companies to get a better idea of the person, compared to the LinkedIn recommendation system which is really “give me a good recommendation, and I’ll do the same for you”. Duedil allows anyone to review anyone else. If the person doesn’t like the review, they can remove the actual content, but the review will show the that content has been removed.\nAnyone can sign-up to Duedil, but it actually makes some assumptions when you enter your details and if it can’t find out anything about you, it wont actually let you in. This is to stop people outside of professional circles from accessing the app. Once you’ve signed-up, you’ll have the ability to invite friends that you trust – so the reputation model expands. The more people that trust you, the more your reputation increases and then, so will the reviews that you give.\nThe plug-in runs in Google’s Chrome browser (on Windows and MacOS X) with",

        "prompt": "A signal literary event of 2009 has occurred, but if publishers had been more vigilant, it could have been a signal literary event in any of the last 60 years. This event is the belated appearance in English of the novel “Every Man Dies Alone,” the story of a working-class Berlin couple who took on the Third Reich with a postcard campaign intended to foment rebellion against Hitler’s Germany. Published in 1947, the book was written in 24 days by a prolific but psychologically disturbed German writer named Rudolf Ditzen, who spent a significant portion of his life in asylums (for killing a friend in a duel, for threatening his wife with a gun), in prison (for embezzling to finance his morphine habit) and in rehab. In spite of his precarious emotional state, he wrote more than two dozen books under the pen name Hans Fallada, which he took from Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\nFalada was the name the Brothers Grimm gave to a slaughtered horse in the story “The Goose Girl,” whose head, nailed on a city gate, speaks to its former mistress, a princess who had been betrayed by her servant. The king of the realm, overhearing the talking head, rights the injustice that caused the horse’s death. (Fallada added a second “l” to make the name his.) “Hans” he took from the Grimm tale “Hans in Luck,” about a man who mistakes his bad luck for good and is contented, let the world jeer as it may. The pen name fulfills its prophecy. Rescued from the grave, from decades of forgetting, this novel, first published just weeks after the author’s death, testifies to the lasting value of an intact, if battered, conscience.\nInspector Escherich’s job is to locate and stop the distributor of the cards, using the pins as a chart of his movements. Will the “postcard phantom” be found? Escherich’s life depends on it; the brutish Obergruppenführer Prall who oversees his activities makes no mystery of that. A terrified populace ensures that the red-flagged pins will continue to be turned in to the authorities. The “phantom” by necessity must live among other people — in a certain building, on a certain street, in a certain neighborhood — during a time when “half the population is set on locking up the other half” and any unusual (or usual) behavior can be reported by neighbors intent on saving their own skins. ­Every man may die alone, but nobody lives alone, or entirely unobserved.\nThe Otto and Anna Quangel of Fallada’s novel are stand-ins for real-life Berliners, Otto and Elise Hampel, a working-class couple who conducted a postcard campaign for more than two years at the height of Hitler’s power, after Elise’s brother was killed in the war. Arrested in October 1942, they were sentenced to death by the Volks­gerichtshof (People’s Court) in January 1943 and executed by beheading. Their Gestapo files came into Fallada’s hands in the fall of 1945, entrusted to him by a poet and postwar culture official, Johannes Becher, who knew of Fallada’s prolific literary output and recognized his gift for objective narration.\nIn a publishing hat trick, Melville House allows English-language readers to sample Fallada’s vertiginous variety — and understand Becher’s faith in him — by accompanying the release of Michael Hofmann’s splendid translation of “Every Man Dies Alone” with the simultaneous publication of excellent English versions of Fallada’s two best-known novels, “Little Man — What Now?” (translated by Susan Bennett) and “The Drinker” (translated by Charlotte and A. L. Lloyd).\n“Little Man — What Now?” became an international hit, translated into more than 20 languages and filmed in both Germany and the United States in the first years of the 1930s. Today its pathos lives on chiefly in the tender song “Kleiner Mann — Was Nun,” by a Weimar-era choral group called the Comedian Harmonists, who sang it together onstage until they were banned from performing (a year and a month after the burning of the Reichstag) because half their members were of Jewish descent. In his probing afterword to “Little Man — What Now?” Philip Brady ponders the question of why the book isn’t better known today: “Enduring success is one thing, immediate impact is something different, and clearly the immediate impact of Fallada’s novel was undeniable.” Given our current economic ­circumstances, the book may have a second chance at impact and endurance.\nFallada’s books generally recapitulated his personal history, from “Young Goedeschal: A Novel of Puberty,” a youthful effort he later disowned, to “Farmers, Functionaries and Fireworks,” a fictionalized account of a conflict between rural workers and greedy authorities in Schleswig-Holstein (he covered the dispute while working as a reporter), to the three novels discussed here. “Every Man Dies Alone” stands above these others, perhaps because so many of the circumstances it enfolds lie outside Fallada’s firsthand experience, forcing him to harness his empathy and broaden his focus. And yet the novel he wrote about the Hampels reads less like fiction than like an act of witness: a reincarnation of their world, a posthumous tribute to their sacrifice.\nBut what can be made of the author himself? An enigmatic, complicated figure, Fallada has been the subject of a handful of biographies in German. The fascinating scholarly afterwords contributed to “Little Man — What Now?",
        "baseline": "” by Philip Brady and to “The Drinker” by John Willet retrace the author’s life and work, and weigh his contribution. They acknowledge that the critics of Fallada’s own era praised him for his “authenticity” and well-drawn characters but questioned his imaginative powers, often dismissing his writing as unpolished or workmanlike — as, in short, an overly literal interpretation of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) that overtook German arts and letters in the 1920s and ’30s in revolt against abstraction and expressionism. But at the remove of more than half a century, Fallada’s reanimation of the actions, motivations and private terrors of Berliners who are long since dead — leaving a full record of wickedness and, sometimes, goodness — is infused with something else. Call it Alte Sachlichkeit: the reality of another age, restored.",

And that’s how Fields, who has since enrolled early at Georgia, is likely to be depicted in the second season of the documentary series \"QB1: Beyond the Lights.\"\nThis is the same show, executive produced by Peter Berg, that rising UGA sophomore Jake Fromm appeared in for its inaugural season a year ago. Fields, along with fellow quarterbacks Sam Hartman (Charleston, South Carolina; Wake Forest) and Re-al Mitchell (Bellflower, California; Iowa State), were followed around during their final year of high school football. The show can be viewed on Verizon's go90.com. The second series' first three episodes premiered Wednesday.\nBrett Whitcomb was the producer who shadowed both Fromm and Fields in consecutive years. During the time he spent with them, Whitcomb noted that both quarterbacks share some of the same leadership qualities. Both carry a certain confidence, which attracts their teammates to them.\nThey also were able to stay level-headed despite the attention they garnered throughout their rise.\nDickmann described Fields as the “the total package.” Fields not only can dazzle with his arm and legs, but his ability to comprehend a complex offense sets him apart from other quarterbacks his age. He’s extremely competitive and hates to lose, which is something Fields admitted during the season’s first episode.\nQuiet and reserved at times, there is also a fun-loving side to Fields that Whitcomb said is captured on film.\nWhen Fields wasn’t preparing for an opponent at practice or giving it his all during a game, he would spend some of his down time with teammates and close friends Marquis Alston and Mario Nunez, whether it was on a boat, at an indoor trampoline park or at the YMCA.\nDickmann called Fields “the best I ever coached” and believes his potential is limitless.

That’s something we don’t control as coaches and players. Those things happen. I’ve seen that happen to some great players and I hope it doesn’t happen to him.",

    {
        "prompt": "The late writer Andre Dubus began buying guns in the 1970s, after a loved one was raped at knifepoint. At first he took a gun with him only when he went out with a woman. No one would be raped where he was concerned.\nBut then he began imagining other scenarios in which a gun would be necessary. There was no end. He carried a gun more often, into more situations, until one night the time came. He found himself pointing his weapon at a stranger who threatened another man with a knife.\nAfter the massacre at Virginia Tech, Americans parted along familiar lines. One side pleaded for more gun control, the other for less. If only students carried guns, the latter's argument went, someone could have made short work of Seung-Hui Cho, and at least reduced the death toll.\nOr perhaps such an armed student, panicked, drunk one night, might have killed someone by mistake. The only difference would be in how we keep score: Towering Rage vs. Tragic Error.\nNot long ago, Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley found a set of studies on how people react to violent events. The consensus was that, jolted by a new awareness of their own mortality, people cling more fervently than ever to their core beliefs.\nGreater certainty, it seems, brings great comfort.\nBegley wanted to know how acts of terrorism might affect voting patterns. But the studies she consulted illuminate our responses to home-grown gun violence as well.\nEvery new rampage ups the stakes.\nConservatives, research shows, become more conservative — more hostile toward those seen as different (in this case, The Crazies). They back more extreme solutions than before.\nThat would explain why the pro-gun faction, once content simply to push hard against restrictions, now wants to pass the ammunition. The more people who go armed, the happier we all shall be.\nAstounded liberals note that Americans already live in a sea of guns, the sheer numbers upping the likelihood they will be used. To these Americans, stronger restrictions are such a no-brainer it practically makes their teeth hurt. Virginia Tech hit them like root canal.\nMost people with this makeup shun militarism and embrace tolerance. They favor constructive engagement with problems. New Yorkers virtually locked these peace-loving values in a death grip after the World Trade Center fell. Which might explain, to bewildered Americans elsewhere, why thousands turned out not for marches to demand revenge but to protest the Iraq invasion, leaving not a soul on the Upper West Side to tend a pan of risotto.\nAt the same time though, flags came out. A gentle patriotism spread across Manhattan, dissolving the liberal stereotype. We may be more complex, and open to change, than the research can show.\nYet at the moment, the American predilection for gun violence seems unalterable. Mass gun slayings do occur elsewhere in the developed world but with nowhere near the same sickening regularity.\nAs Wesleyan English professor Richard Slotkin has noted, the prerogative of private violence is deeply imbedded in our collective psyche, partly owing to the mythology of the frontier. Guns (for men especially) are entwined with notions of equality and status. Our films, music and video games celebrate this aspect of American identity more than ever, and are not an irrelevant aside.\nToday, no one on either side of the gun divide can seriously argue that our current policies are working. But few have the courage to face them down.\nThe Republicans have mostly dug in alongside the many opponents of firearms restrictions. The Democrats have grown hard-headed and will introduce only token reforms. They paid a political price, they believe, for supporting the assault-weapons ban and other gun-control measures in the early 1990s, and they do not intend to pay again.\nAn ex-Marine, Andre Dubus was as much a product of our bullet culture as anyone. He loved the heft and feel, indeed the beauty, of guns. But he underwent a change of heart about going forth armed.\nHe explores this change in \"Giving Up the Gun,\" an essay more riveting than any piece on a decision has a right to be. Attempts to paraphrase his searching meditation would do it violence. But it is worth noting that Dubus made his decision after he was hit by a car, and forced to use a wheelchair for the rest of his days.\n",
        "baseline": "Dubus did not, in his turning-point encounter, fire on the man with the knife. (An unarmed person intervened.) But he saw how having the gun seemed to give him no choice but to use it.\nWe have choices. We could make it easier to detain a troubled adolescent for care; easier for parents to increase control over children's TV viewing; easier to do strict background checks on weapons buyers.\nBut we are curiously paralyzed — as if we believe that the unfettered flow of guns, despite evidence from other societies, is the inevitable price of freedom; as if we believe the desperately ill, the spiritually maimed, must be free to fall into the fiery pit; as if we are not free to write a new story of who we are.\nI do not know what it would take to get more Americans to ford the stream that Dubus did. A million or more acts of imagination, maybe. A million or more surrenders to faith.",

One would understand if executives were nervous and chose to play it safe. Instead, in an already volatile cultural climate dominated by discussions of police shooting unarmed black men and the Black Lives Matter hashtag born in the wake of these injustices, they put out a show that featured a bulletproof, and oft-shot, black man wearing a hoodie—an aesthetic comment on the death of Trayvon Martin. Instead of ignoring the growing influence of Black Lives Matter activists or merely gesturing toward their existence, this was a show that chose to lean into the movement—going so far as having Alfre Woodard’s character, Mariah Dillard, say the slogan 30 minutes into the first show. It was a bold move for Netflix and the show’s corporate co-parent, Disney, a media conglomerate not known for its willingness to take chances. And it set the stage for what was to come 17 months later in February 2018, when the world took a trip to Wakanda. Yet, many forget that before Black Panther broke box-office records, Luke Cage broke Netflix.\nIn its second season, and a very different cultural climate, Marvel’s examination of what would happen if a black man in the inner city had superpowers is, whether intentionally or not, in conversation with Marvel’s film featuring an African king. One thing it shows is that there is more than one way to use music to tell a story about a black character in this universe.\nBlack Panther reminded me of black films that came out in the ’90s. Like them, it featured an incredible soundtrack showcasing some of the best that black music had to offer. Hip-hop permeated the score and provided the background to many of the scenes, but in Boyz N the Hood and Menace II Society, few characters in the film actually seemed to listen to the music. Luke Cage does things differently.\nMarvel’s examination of what would happen if a black man in the inner city had superpowers is, whether intentionally or not, in conversation with Marvel’s film featuring an African king.\nCoker understands that an important part of fully appreciating black music is showing how listening to the music inspires a physical reaction. It might be dancing (as illustrated by the scenes in Harlem’s Paradise, a club that has the best music-booker of all time) or reacting to the vibe the music creates (like when Luke Cage puts on headphones before every fight). He further shows that black music exists on a continuum and gives extended time in almost every episode to black musicians representing the history of black music in America. There are blues guitarists like Gary Clark, Jr., R&B soul singers like Joi, and hip-hop legends like Ghostface Killa—not to mention the indomitable Rakim, who created new music that is featured in the Season 2 finale. This is a show that understands the centrality of music in day to day life of black folks, but it’s not only music that puts Luke Cage in conversation with Black Panther. It also shows us that black anger is not limited to the African and African American experience.\nMichael B. Jordan’s N’Jadaka (Killmonger) is unquestionably the best thing about Black Panther. His anger with the leadership of Wakanda and his love for those he saw as his people (mostly men, apparently, given the violence he inflicted upon black women) was evident. Luke Cage has a villain in a similar vein with John McIver, a Jamaican crime boss known as Bushmaster. With both characters, there is an understanding of one’s connection with those who have come before—and a drive to avenge the past.\nMustafa Shakir is quietly menacing as the primary villain of the season, but as the story develops, we",
        "baseline": " learn that Bushmaster, like Jordan’s N’Jadaka, has family trauma at the center of his motivations. Like Killmonger, Bushmaster feels that he was denied his birthright; however, unlike the struggle that ensued for Wakanda, Luke Cage is not the enemy; he is just in the way of Bushmaster’s quest for vengeance. The motivations of these characters mirror each other in ways that deepen their humanity while moving the narrative forward. Bushmaster and Killmonger are what make these stories work, and both Black Panther and Luke Cage show that the black experience, whether in America or the motherland, is rich with potential for future storytelling.\nI don’t know if Cheo Hodari Coker intended to put Season 2 of Luke Cage in conversation with Black Panther. Yet, intentional or not, Marvel’s show about a superhero serves as a fascinating counterpoint to Marvel’s film about the king of Wakanda.",

Not ideal for his high blood pressure, either.\nFor an immigrant from Bangladesh, though, driving was a job that could bring in $400 to $500 a week — enough to pay the bills.\nThat changed when ride sharing came to Philadelphia in 2014. Golamkader, like many of the city’s 1,500 cabdrivers, has spent four years trying to earn what he did before Uber and Lyft. That meant switching from driving a taxi to driving for Uber, and then, in 2017, switching back again.\nGolamkader’s weekly earnings are down about $200 compared with four years ago.\nDrivers face difficult choices in this changing environment: Work through a ride-hailing app, put strain on their personal vehicles, and compete with a seemingly ever-growing population of drivers, or work for a cab industry that is bleeding customers.\nIn 2017, taxis made $43 million less than in 2014 and had 4.2 million fewer fares, according to Philadelphia Parking Authority data. The value of a medallion, the auctioned permit that allows a cab to operate, was $500,000 in 2014, compared with $38,000 in April.\nThe pressure is wearing on the city’s cabbies, said Ron Blount, president of the Taxi Workers Alliance of Philadelphia.\nNow, he said, it’s difficult for a cabdriver to earn minimum wage.\nA recent New York Times story about the suicides of four professional drivers in New York City this year cited the for-hire car industry’s difficulties.\nPeople in the cab industry say a shift back to cab driving, like Golamkader’s, has become increasingly common as drivers find the best way to maximize their earnings.\nGolamkader first drove for Uber Black in 2014 and did well, but UberX, Uber’s primary ride-share service, eventually took his customers, he said.",

    {
        "prompt": "I’m a big fan of Bari Weiss, and I think there are a lot of interesting things in her essay on the “Intellectual Dark Web,” a phrase I’d never heard until this morning.\nAnd perhaps that’s part of the reason I think the label is a bit overwrought, and Weiss’s thesis a bit off target.\nFirst, let me say that the phrase “Intellectual Dark Web” strikes me as a marketing label — and not necessarily a good one. The actual Dark Web is full of terrible and criminal things. I get the idea of wanting to sound subversive and transgressive, but the Intellectual Dark Web sounds not only a little gimmicky for a purportedly serious intellectual movement. It also sounds a little desperate, like a middle-aged man deciding to wear biker jackets and ride a Harley to prove how rebellious he is.\nMore substantively, I guess I still don’t get it. Having read the essay twice, it seems to me this IDW thing isn’t actually an intellectual movement. It’s just a coalition of thinkers and journalists who happen to share a disdain for the keepers of the liberal orthodoxy. Weiss recounts a bunch of conversion tales where once-respected and iconoclastic liberal types run head-on into the groupthink or party line of the liberal establishment. They suddenly have a revelation about the enforced orthodoxy of their own side, and as they pull on these intellectual threads, they face blowback and reinforcement from unexpected places.\nWhere have we heard that before? Well, it’s the story of successive waves of neoconservatives in the 1960s and 1970s. It’s the story of former Communists — Burnham, Meyer, Eastman, et al. — who joined the founding generation of National Review. It’s the story Whittaker Chambers tells in Witness. It’s also the story of many of the progressive intellectuals who were disillusioned by the First World War. Are they exact parallels? Of course not — in part because these are different times. Irving Kristol famously said, “a neoconservative is a liberal who’s been mugged by reality.” New realities may create different muggings, but the pattern is awfully familiar.\nA list of very different people with different ideas and different people who share the ability to reject bad liberal cant and groupthink sounds like a great bunch. Indeed, I like and admire nearly all of the people Weiss profiles — and I know quite a few of them (indeed, some are colleagues of mine). But I’m still missing the theme to the pudding.\nWeiss suggests that one thing that unites all of these people is how they bypass “legacy” media. As someone in this business, I certainly find it interesting how folks such as Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson have figured out “how to monetize social justice warriors,” in Peterson’s words. But I’m not sure the fact that they’re using podcasts, YouTube, and other social media to get their messages out is as significant as Weiss makes it sound. You know who else is using podcasts, YouTube, and other social media to get their messages out? Everybody. And there are any number of enforcers and supporters of liberal orthodoxy and dogma who have made a roaring success of alternative media, too.\nThe media landscape has been balkanizing for a very long time, and entrepreneurs such as Shapiro have had remarkable success as early adopters and adapters. But I don’t think Shapiro’s burgeoning media empire is best described as his being shunned by or “locked out from” the legacy media. He’s",
        "baseline": " no victim, and neither is Peterson. And while the protests and shout-downs at college campuses do say something important about liberalism today, I’m hard-pressed to see how most of these very successful people have been “silenced” in some broader sense. Indeed, there are many people who share many of the IDWers’ ideas yet haven’t lost their perches in academia or journalism. Do they not count?\nI don’t mean to be too harsh. I learned a lot from the essay, and some of the issues raised by Weiss and her subjects — the need for gatekeeping, line-drawing, and resisting being captured by an audience — are important topics. But they are also issues that conservative institutions — magazines, journals, think tanks, foundations, etc. — have been grappling with for decades. This is an interesting new chapter, but, again, I’m not sure it’s a new story.",

El-Gammal traveled from Phoenix to New York City in October 2014 and met with the younger man, prosecutors say.\nEl-Gammal and a co-conspirator in Turkey allegedly worked to connect el-Goarany with ISIS. Cops arrested el-Gammal in August 2015, and he reached out to his Turkish connection soon after — ultimately asking el-Goarany to make a video to clear him, according to prosecutors.\nEl-Goarany complied and made a video on Sept. 8, 2015 — about two months before he died — saying, \"I came here and I made this",
        "baseline": " video to let you know that I came here out of my own will,\" prosecutors further claim.\nEl-Goarany also allegedly said: \"I didn't come to this decision with anybody's influence or anybody's recruitment. I came here. It was my decision and mine alone. Nobody financed me to come here ... Nobody bought my plane ticket. All that (was) with my own money. Nobody showed me the way to get here.\"\nEl-Goarany also denied el-Gammal had any role in his plans.\n\"And nobody helped me along the way to get here — including Ahmed Mohammed el-Gammal — in America. And I'm making this video just to let the authorities know this. This is my statement, and use it however you wish,\" el-Goarany said.\nDeFilippis said this video \"is a transparent, almost ridiculous, denial\" and \"powerful proof\" of el-Gammal's guilt.",

        "prompt": "The declaration communicated through the director general of military operations (DGMO) of Pakistan and India on May 29, 2018, to implement the ceasefire agreement of 2003 between the two countries in “letter and spirit” has opened up an opportunity to restore peace in the disturbed Kashmir valley. Indeed, the positive atmosphere generated by the 2003 agreement had not merely cleared the decks for opening up of the Srinagar-Muzzafarabad and the Poonch-Rawalkot routes between the two countries but also allowed India to fence the Line of Control (LoC). More recently, the Pakistani army has said there’s no space for war with India.\nHowever, in spite of the ceasefire agreement, after 2008, and especially during the last two years, there have been repeated violations of the LoC in Kashmir. If the LoC is for all practical purposes treated as the de facto international border, then approximately 980 incidences of ceasefire violations have been reported so far in 2018 and there were 860 in 2017. In addition, there is also the actual ground position line (AGPL) that currently divides Indian and Pakistani forces on the Siachen glacier. So far, constant shelling and firing across the border by Pakistan has led to the loss of hundreds of civilian lives in the border districts. Much property has been damaged too.\nIndo-Pak ties began to deteriorate steeply after the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) attacked an army base in Uri and killed 19 Indian soldiers on September 18, 2016. In response, India launched surgical strikes, quite successfully, on the launching pads of terrorist outfits in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on September 29, 2016. It also moved ahead to isolate Pakistan internationally. A favourable response to India’s initiative from the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member-states such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka led to the cancellation of the SAARC summit scheduled for November 2016 in Islamabad. Although the current bilateral initiative to normalise the LoC appears to be a positive step, maintaining peace at the borders is going to be a challenging task. Pakistan’s fragile polity, the growing menace of Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism in India, the overall atmosphere of mistrust between the two countries and the acute alienation of some sections of Kashmiri youth will obstruct peace-building processes.\nPakistan’s fragile polity has always alternated between civilian and military regimes. Even if civilian supremacy over the military is gradually getting institutionalised after the ouster of the Pervez Musharraf regime in 2008, the military still plays an overwhelmingly dominant role in Pakistan’s polity. Till recently a constant tussle for supremacy between democratically elected Nawaz Sharif regime (2013-17) and the praetorians of the army offered evidence of the same. Irrespective of this tussle, military as well as civilian regimes have always taken full advantage of Pakistan’s strategic location. With the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, Pakistan became a frontline state in the new Cold War. Consequently, the US and Saudi Arabia poured arms and money into Pakistan, which in turn sheltered Afghan refugees and harboured and trained about 1,00,000 militants/mujahideen. Eventually, it was the mujahideen who forced the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan in 1988. In the 1990s, Pakistan exploited the chaotic political conditions in Afghanistan and actively supported the Taliban regime (1996-2001).\nParadoxically, Pakistan, once again, became a frontline state and the US’s ally in the global war on terror after 9/11. In return, from 2002 to 2017, the US gave more than $33 billion in aid to Pakistan.\nHowever, in the process of lending its soil to external powers and taking the responsibility of training Islamic militants to wage holy wars, Pakistan began to face serious problems of governance, emanating from skewed and uneven development. Gross neglect of Baluchistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and most rural parts have impacted overall development.\nConsequently, the political process in Pakistan has been characterised by inter-province, inter-ethnic and intra-religious tensions. To cap it all, the predominance of the army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), together with the mushrooming of terrorist outfits, have kept civilian regimes on edge.\nPakistan has for expedient reasons maintained it is committed to fighting terrorism, but over the years, it has also emerged as the hub of terrorism institutionalised through what has come to be known as the ‘deep state’. Unequivocal condemnations of acts of terror have been rare because its military and the ISI have been guilty of supporting terrorist activities of outfits such as LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Afghanistan and India have had to bear the brunt of terrorism emanating from Pakistan. In order to reduce India’s growing influence in Afghanistan, Pakistan has provided safe haven to radical Islamic groups such as the Afghan Taliban and its Haqqani branch. Pakistan has also been supporting them with weapons and intelligence because it has often banked on Taliban regaining formal political power to ensure its own stability. Likewise, the role of terrorism and terrorist outfits has always been potent enough to impede any peaceful settlement of Indo-Pak ties.\nThe Kashmir question continues to be at the heart of strained ties between India and Pakistan. India has not been able handle, effectively, the disturbed youth, protracted internal disturbances and the frequent breakdown of the law and order in Kashmir in the last three decades. In order to ‘liberate’ Kashmir from India, Pakistan has set up terrorist camps in PoK. Leaders of terrorist outfits, such as Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), and the founder of LeT have consistently mobilised youth in Kashmir as well as in Pakistan, all in the name of ‘freeing’ Kashmir from India. The LeT sprang up with the support and funding from Al Qaeda, which was then led by Osama bin Laden. As the largest terrorist outfit in South Asia, the LeT has been held responsible for the attack on Indian parliament in 2001, the Mumbai train attack of July 2006 and Mumbai attack of 26/11 that killed 164 people. By now, LeT has been designated a global terrorist outfit and banned by major powers including the US, UK and India in 2001, Australia in 2003 and the European Union in 2010. The United Nations brought it among the listed terrorist outfits in 2008. By formally banning the LeT in 2002 and later its new avatar, the JuD, in 2018, Pakistan has only paid lip service to its alleged commitment to eradicate terrorism. The US, having put Hafeez Saeed on the list of most wanted terrorists, had announced an award of $10 million on him in April 2012. Furthermore, in August 2017, the Trump administration offered aid to Pakistan with strings. Accordingly, Pakistan could access aid worth $255 million only if it had taken concrete steps to counter terrorism in Afghanistan. Trump also appealed to India to enhance its developmental role in Afghanistan. Despite president Trump’s admonishment of Pakistan for supporting terrorist groups and growing international pressure through the United Nations (UN) on Pakistan to contain terrorism, Hafiz Saeed has been, generally, moving freely in Pakistan with tacit state support and his activities are steadily becoming a part of mainstream politics.\nLike the LeT, the JeM, with roots in the Deobandi terrorist organisations like the Harkat-ul-Mujahidin (HuM) of the late 1990s, was another deadly terrorist organisation committed to the ‘liberation’ of Kashmir. Both HuM and JeM had full backing from the ISI. In 1999, the HuM had hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 from Kathmandu to Delhi to Kandahar and had slit the throat of one of the hostages. In order to ensure safe release of the hostages, India agreed to the HuM demands and released three deadly terrorists. The HuM, in its new avatar as the JeM, was not merely supported by the ISI but was firmly aligned with Taliban and the Al Qaeda before it was banned in 2002. Subsequently, the JeM resurfaced under different names. In 2016, immediately after prime minister Narendra Modi’s informal visit to Pakistan, the JeM is suspected to have attacked the Pathankot military air base in India with the support of Pakistan’s military, although Pakistan denied offering such support. What is more, Hafiz Saeed has links with Hurriyat and terrorist leaders such as Sayed Salahuddin, who leads terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahidin from Kashmir. People in Kashmir and Pakistan also publicly celebrated the ‘martyrdom’ of Burhan Wani, a young terrorist from Kashmir who died in an encounter in July 2016. Wani’s death inspired 35 young men to join terrorist outfits in Kashmir itself.\nBesides, there are two significant problems that could further obstruct normalisation of Indo-Pakistan ties. First, the terrorist outfits in Pakistan are well connected with multinational terrorist organisation such as Al Qaeda, which has been a major non-state actor in world politics. Hence, ‘liberating’ Kashmir has become a cry of the entire radicalised Islamic groups. Evidently, India has to contain state sponsored terrorism",

Second, a piece of land in PoK, adjacent to Aksai Chin, has been ceded by Pakistan to China. Besides, China’s initiatives to build One Belt One Road (OBOR) and China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) through Pakistani territory have firmed up the durable ties between the two countries. Since the OBOR is likely to pass via PoK, India has expressed reservations about it in no uncertain terms. Although India treats Kashmir strictly as a bilateral issue, it cannot remain indifferent to China’s presence in Kashmir.\nIn a word, apparently the process of normalisation of Indo-Pakistan ties has commenced but it has to counter byzantine complexities before attaining any noteworthy success.\nHarshe, a former vice-chancellor of the Central University of Allahabad, is president of the GB Pant Institute of Social Science, Allahabad.",

        "prompt": "Most people know McNulty and Bunk as characters in David Simon's acclaimed HBO series—but they were actually players in a 19th-century book by H.B. Ogden. Seriously.\nMost people know The Wire as the HBO police drama set in Baltimore—an intricate five-season exploration of the brokenness of the inner-city's war on drugs, education system, politics, and policing, and one of the most lauded television shows of all time. Fewer people know that it was originally a Victorian serial by the almost forgotten writer H.B. Ogden. Such, at least, was the claim of Sean Michael Robinson and Joy DeLyria, who created a virtuoso analysis of Ogden's work and an airtight argument as to why The Wire, with its serial format, moral message, and sympathy for the downtrodden, was quintessentially Victorian, and could never be reproduced in our own time. They accompanied their text with drawings (by Robinson) from the original Wire, including a striking depiction of Omar Little walking down a London street as urchins scatter around him.\nRobinson and DeLyria's essay appeared on my blog, the Hooded Utilitarian, and quickly went viral. A year later, powerHouse books is publishing an entire novel/critique/parody called Down in the Hole: The unWired World of H.B. Ogden, out this week. The book resets numerous scenes from The Wire in a 19th-century London setting—whether it's D'Angelo, Bodie, and Wallace discussing processed chicken parts, or McNulty and Bunk investigating a crime scene while spewing colorful Victorian slang. DeLyria and Robinson also analyze the serial's structure, themes, and canonicity—and provide a copious helping of new illustrations I spoke to the two last month about H.B. Ogden and The Wire.\nOn the copyright page, the book is referred to as a \"parody\" of The Wire. I presume that that's a legal definition ... but I'm curious to what extent you see this as a parody?\nRobinson: The legal aspect of the question is hard to disentangle from the rest. Let's just say that of the accepted applications of fair use, including commentary, educational purposes, and parody, parody has been the one most consistently upheld by courts. And I have no doubt that that the book could be seen as a parody of The Wire—taking the dialogue out of the context of the show and placing it into a cultural context that we see as much more stuffy and restrained as our own creates a very jarring effect that certainly could be seen as some kind of commentary of both.\nBut I think our intention, anyway, is something more strange and loving than straight parody, although that's present as well. We both have a deep affection for the show, a deep affection for self-referential meta-fiction, for the literature of the Victorian period and serial fiction in general, and legal definitions aside, you could see the book as a big sloppy love letter to all of those things.\nSo in what ways, or how, is The Wire comparable to Victorian serialized fiction?\nDeLyria: Serialized novels came out a chapter at a time. Some chapters were a little more episodic than others; sometimes they featured side-plots or characters. For the most part, however, one would not be content simply reading a single chapter (as one would watching a single episode of M*A*S*H). In this sense, a show like The Wire compares to serial novels due to the way in which it's delivered to the consumer.\nThe novels themselves sometimes highlighted a single protagonist with a single through-line (think David Copperfield), but even these featured large casts, multiple plotlines, and sprawling narrative focused on many different aspects of life. Serialized narrative in that era (in England as well as elsewhere) also tended to focus on social problems, possibly because the format lent itself to such exploration (due to length), but also probably due to a general zeitgeist. The Wire follows many characters through many plots, and focuses on many of the same themes.\nThe main way in which The Wire differs from these novels in structure is the \"seasons\" format. Victorian novels were often split into volumes, but these delineations didn't mark shifts in characters, plot, or theme. While all five seasons of The Wire are connected, each season introduces new characters, follows a new major plot, and introduces another thematic layer. Although a single season is considerably enriched by watching the other seasons, it can be understood by itself. There isn't really a parallel to that kind of structure in Victorian literature.\nHow serious are you when you suggest that The Wire is comparable as an aesthetic achievement to something like Bleak House? Does The Wire's visual style compare to Dickens' prose, for example?\nRobinson: A lot of the strongest statements in the book are intended as provocations as much as actual arguments. That being said, there's no doubt that The Wire is an incredibly complex piece of fiction, that uses narrative in a lot of really interesting ways, and that manages to be persuasive without being didactic. Those are incredibly rare things in any art form, and deserve to be celebrated as high achievements.\nOf course, if we're treating prose style and narrative deftness in a novel as analogues to visual style or other formal elements of television storytelling, I don't think The Wire really stands up aesthetically to most of Dickens' work.\nSo, there are lots of places, particularly visually but also occasionally narratively, that The Wire doesn't hold up as well as one might hope for an aspirant to the category of timeless art, but many of those things are a function of the economic necessities of television—quick turnaround, the massive amount of individual hands needed to create filmed media, all of the tens of thousands of decisions that must be made every day a show is in production. So if the show isn't as visually consistent or flamboyant as a David Lynch film, or occasionally took narrative detours that don't have payoffs, I think those are forgivable sins. Those are not dissimilar in fact to the production problems facing Dickens and other writers of serials—it's an accident of typesetting, for instance, that we have the version of, say, Oliver Twist that we do. He would typically overwrite each installment—that is, write more than he knew would be included in the actual serialization, and mark in the manuscript which portions could be most easily eliminated or trimmed so as to make the page count for each installment.\nDeLyria: As Sean says, visually, it lacks panache, although there's a perfectly valid argument to be made for a style that doesn't call attention to itself. The idea behind Hemingway's writing is that the narrator falls away; the action becomes the center of the reader's focus, rather than the telling of it. The Wire (unlike a Victorian novel) was going for that journalistic style, and for the most part succeeds.\nHowever, Hemingway's style still manages to be idiosyncratic (as you say, does Dickens's), and I don't think The Wire manages that. In order to remove the narrator and highlight the action, the show's visual effects are for the most part mundane.\nSean, I wondered too what you were using as touchstones for the illustrations? And also, specifically, how much you relied on the television show for the visual style?\nRobinson: Halbot Knight Brown, a.k.a. \"Phiz,\" was the chief model for the illustrations. It seemed appropriate—he was Dickens' chief collaborator, his work was readily available to me, and he was enough \"of the time\" stylistically that he was completely passe and unable to find work after a few decades of popular acclaim. As prep before we started the book, I sat down and copied a whole range of his drawings in pencil, just trying to internalize his stylization and visual tics. Some of my own tics and limitations kept creeping in too, but for the most part I think I nailed the look pretty closely—although I used a lot looser of a line than would be typical of him, in keeping with the reputation for the Wire's grittiness, and because it happens to be something I do well and it seemed a shame to not exploit one of my strengths.\nI'd take a look at the scenes in question as a starting point for the illustrations, but with the exception of the crime investigation scene, I can't think of any that were actually useful as visual reference. The serial was supposed to have begun in 1846, which is just a completely different world, visually speaking, from our own culture. If you look at illustrations from the time period, you would hardly ever see close-ups on subjects, or have significantly high or low views on a scene, or even have elements exiting the side of illustration. These are all elements that would be much more common after photography was ubiquitous, not necessarily because illustrators would be using photography as an aide in their drafting, but because seeing photos for a lifetime trains you to see in a fundamentally different way. It would have seemed strange and alien to a working illustrator from the time period to have critical elements of a picture cut in half by the border of their image, or to frame a subject really tightly, unless it was a portrait or a bust or some already accepted stylization. So there goes most of the shots used in television or film.\nThe racial politics of contemporary Baltimore are obviously a lot different than the racial politics of Victorian England. Was making that translation difficult?\nDeLyria: In my opinion, this is the biggest failure of the book. If there's one reason you shouldn't make The Wire into a piece of Victorian literature, it's race. There is no way of getting around that question, and attempts to do so ignore some of The Wire's central messages. There's no way to really deal with it either, though.\nOne of my favorite parts of The Wire was a scene I attempted to rewrite for the book. D'Angelo is at a fancy restaurant with his girlfriend; he looks around and asks whether she notices how different they are. His girlfriend seems surprised; she doesn't think that other people really care that they're African American. D'Angelo says, \"It's not even about that.\" The trouble is, The Wire isabout that, but its treatment is rarely so simplistic as to merely address outright, recognizable bigotry. The Wire isn't about race and racism in a vacuum; it's about class, how class is inextricably linked to all the aspects of our culture and ourselves.\nNow, we can certainly talk about class and classism in Victorian literature, so I did. We can also talk about how class is about a lot more than just money, but I couldn't explicitly state that it was about race. Race was a big part of classism in Victorian England also, but to claim that it exactly parallels modern America would be both facile and offensive. Instead, I could only hint that there was a lot more to the issue than what the text stated, and implicitly ask the reader to compare these two different societies. Sean drew the characters as the race they were in the show in order to highlight this, constantly reminding the reader that a Victorian novel is not the perfect analogue for The Wire after all.\nRobinson: I think even if race and class are not wholly analogous, we still owed it to our argument to make the comparison as thoroughly as we were capable. It generates an interesting effect, not dissimilar to the trick of displacement in regards to the dialogue. It's also worth noting that during the Victorian period, the idea that class was an inherent, and inherited, set of characteristics was still the prevalent view, and complete pseudo-scientific systems, physiognomy et al, seemed to exist only to butress that view.\nYou talk a bit about reality and The Wire. Is The Wire more realistic than its contemporary Victorian novels? What makes it so, or what makes it feel so?\nDeLyria: Not having lived in Victorian England, this question is hard to answer. I haven't lived in Baltimore either, but",
        "baseline": " I can say I've been in classes similar to those portrayed in the show's fourth season; I've read articles similar to those published in the fifth, and I've heard voices like Bunk's and McNulty's.\nI think that people tend to be more idiosyncratic and three-dimensional in both real life and The Wire than they are in some of Dickens' novels. Other Dickens novels and literature from the time do portray characters who are multi-dimensional, but they still do not feel as fleshed out as they do on The Wire.\nI also do think that The Wire is bleaker than most of the novels of the time. It offers no solutions. Dickens had no solutions for how to change the social structure of London, but he did suggest that kindness and charity had a direct correlation to the improvement of the life of an individual. In The Wire, solutions are a lot less direct and visible than that, which I think is closer to the way real life works.",

Between the Union and Confederate camps, the civilian camp of Reedsburg stood as a buffer zone.\n“(The re-enactment is) not just a bunch of guys shooting rifles and playing cowboys,” said re-enactment coordinator Reed Suttle, it’s an educational experience.\nRe-enactors in period clothing sold clothing, antiques and other props.\nOne tent featured “Dr. Malarkey,” whose sign advertised him as a surgeon and physician with “relatively painless dentistry.” The doctor explained Civil War pain treatments and triage procedures to visitors. Because there were so few of them, doctors could only spend up to half an hour with a typical soldier, leading to more amputations because they were quicker than trying to reconstruct the injured limb.\nReenactors also dressed as “suttlers,” or vendors, who would sell items to",
        "baseline": " the soldiers that the armies didn’t provide, such as candles, matches and tinwear, Reed said.\nIn a tent advertising “fine whiskey and ale,” Adam England and Talese Fogg sat playing with dominoes.\nReferred to disparagingly as “camp followers,” the characters preferred to call themselves “entrepreneurs,” providing valuable services to the soldiers.\nThe re-enactors, coming out of their characters, explained that not all history is politically correct, but it is important to represent nonetheless.\nBut in an instant, they reverted to their roles as two suttlers, and offered their embalming services.\n“Nothing is more important to the living than whiskey and embalming to the dead,” Fogg said in character.\nThe re-enactment continues 10 a.m. Sunday, with battles at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.",

It changed its name and the technology which produced it, but retained its identity, right to the present day.\nThe idea for a community newspaper for Stratford actually began before 1958. Some years before when Keith Anderson was a printing trade apprentice at the Broadway Printing Office, his boss received a visit from the local Rotary Club. He overheard some of the delegates discussing the possibility of starting up a local paper and Keith filed it away.\nThat particular scheme did not eventuate, the many technical difficulties appearing too great at the time.\nAfter finishing his apprenticeship, Keith moved to New Plymouth where he worked as a printing machinist for the Daily News.\nEventually he moved back to Stratford, becoming a business partner with his former Broadway Printing boss, Fred Kilburn. At the back of his mind was the nagging idea of starting up a newspaper.\nThe scheme was revived following a chance meeting in the street between Keith, Hoddie Hodgson and Mac McCutcheon, which got around to the topic of... you guessed it ....a newspaper for Stratford.\nKeith went back to his partner to discuss the idea of a small, news sheet for the district, perhaps four tabloid pages once a month.\nFred agreed with the proposal, providing Keith took over responsibility for the venture.\nHoddie Hodgson and Mac McCutcheon and other Rotary Club members were keen on the idea and began drumming up support among the business members in case the paper eventuated.\nIt wasn't easy to get off the ground and later Keith Anderson said that it probably would not have survived without the assistance of the local Rotary Club.\nEight pages were delivered free to 2000 homes each week. It was the first free community newspaper to be published outside the main metropolitan areas.\n\"It looked good on the outside,\" commented Keith in a Press interview in the late 90s, \"but behind the scenes it was bedlam at its best.\"\nAn old hand-fed press was used almost continuously for the paper. Sheets were hand-fed into the press at the rate of 1000 an hour at two pages a time, starting Wednesday afternoon and going to Friday morning.\nSix months after the Press first hit the streets, the company was able to purchase its own linotype machine which eliminated the need to send copy to Palmerston North. The paper began to grow, too fast in fact because it became too big for the available equipment. The hand-fed press moved at snail's pace and couldn't keep up with demand.\nA new Italian press was purchased. The Mountain Town News was laid to rest on December 15, 1959 and in February, 1960 the locals were greeted by the 'Stratford Press'.\nEverything was looking rosy for the Press until disaster struck.\nOn the night of July 20, 1962 the printing factory was razed to the ground. After a blow like that the paper should have folded, but the next Thursday, Stratford Press was back on the streets with its biggest-ever headline, 'DOWN BUT NOT OUT'.\nThe community rallied around the paper and helped save it. The Stratford Borough Council held a special emergency meeting the night after the fire, with Keith Anderson in attendance. Through the efforts of the council, an old bakery building in Miranda Street was made available. Offers of help came from New Plymouth and Hawera newspapers.\nKeith and Allan accepted the offer to print at Hawera and spent long hours ensuring the paper got out on time.\nThe heavy lead printing forms were set up in the old bakery. An old Fordson van struggled to Hawera with the forms each Wednesday afternoon and struggled back with the forms and 5000 copies of the Press.\nSoon after Ken Hodson became a shareholder in the company and between the two working partners and the other shareholder, Brian Tobin, the company planned a rebuild on Broadway.\nKeith took over the editorship in 1962, which he retained until 1971.\nA new Goss Community offset press was installed in 1967. It was the first to be installed by a community paper and the fourth in the country. This new method of printing brought with it many technical changes. New photo processing equipment had to be installed. It is in this form that the Stratford Press continued to prosper with the continued support of the community it serves.\nWhen the mountain beckoned, Keith Anderson sold his interest in Stratford Press to his former shareholders. Ken Hodson became Manager.\nWith the unt",
        "baseline": "imely death of Ken, his wife Rosemary took over the reins.\nIn 1981 ownership of the company was taken over by Laurence Bunyan, Gloria Webby and Russell Smith.\nRussell parted company with Laurence and Gloria in 1988 to open his own print business, Jago Print.\nStephen Coleman returned from Auckland to fill the vacancy left by Russell Smith.\nOn April 1, 2006 the paper was purchased by APN New Zealand Ltd when the company was owned by Stephen and Carey Coleman and Laurence and Rhonda Bunyan. While all advertising, editorial and pagination is retained by Stratford staff, the paper is printed in Wanganui.\nFrom humble beginnings with a circulation figure of 2000, to over 9000, all who have been associated with the 'Stratty' Press over the past 47 years can reflect with a great deal of pride on their achievements.\nToday, the Stratford Press is located on Broadway North and still an integral part of the community.",

        "baseline": " as a whole\".\nIn a statement he urged BAE systems to put emphasis on voluntary redundancy and offer \"transitional assistance\" for redundant staff to find new employment.\nHe said he was working with Chorley MP Lindsay Hoyle on the issue and they were contacting all the affected North West MPs \"to get them on board when representations are made to the Secretary of State for Defence\".\nNia Griffith MP - shadow secretary of state for defence - said it was \"devastating news\" for workers and their families.\n\"The men and women who work on the Eurofighter are highly skilled and the potential loss of these jobs would have an appalling impact on them, the local economy and wider supply chains,\" she said.\nThe Labour MP for Llanelli also called on the government to urgently come up with a \"clear plan to secure these jobs\" and said it \"must give long-term certainty to the industry\".\nWhat's it like to fly a Typhoon jet?",

Cedric Jones, though, stops short of declaring in advance that his battle tomorrow afternoon with Roman Oben is going to be a one-sided victory.\nJones at defensive end takes on Oben at left tackle as the Giants look to build a four-game winning streak at the expense of the struggling Browns in Cleveland. Jones and Oben practiced against each other for the past four years, ever since the two were selected by the Giants two rounds apart in the 1996 NFL draft. They both are professional, fairly quiet gentleman who will engage in physical combat, for real, for the first time.\nFinding an edge is difficult, if not impossible. Reports out of Cleveland are that Oben is playing fine, not great, not terrible. The Browns have only allowed 14 sacks – they gave up 60 last season – and Oben has been credited for some of the improvement. Oben this week sent word he did not have time in his schedule to respond to an interview request.\nIt says something about the Browns (2-7) that they have three players starting at key positions who were employed last season by the Giants, and that the Giants were not exactly despondent when all three left town and signed on in Cleveland.\nSuch is the way of life for second-year expansion teams. They must make do and fill up their rosters with castoffs, but rarely do three players from one team settle down in a new venue and then get the chance the following season to all go against their former team.\nReceiver David Patten spent three years with the Giants; free safety Percy Ellsworth spent four. Both were undrafted free agents who did well to stick in the NFL and both had some bright moments with the Giants.\nOben’s story is more intriguing. He was a third-round draft pick in 1996, and the past three years started every game for the Giants at left tackle. When he became a free agent, though, the Giants made an effort to re-sign him, but at the price they determined. Oben thought he was worth more than the $3 million annual salary the Giants offered, and he was also upset with reports that the Giants, who had already signed Lomas Brown, were considering moving him inside to guard. When the Browns came up with a better deal, Oben reluctantly left the Giants.\nNo doubt, this will be an emotional outing for Oben. The Giants recall last season",

His promising season a year ago (career-high 7.5 sacks, plus a team-high five forced fumbles) has not carried over to this season. Jones, bothered by a sprained thumb, has 32 tackles but only 1.5 sacks and has not forced any fumbles.\nPerhaps seeing his former practice partner across the line will spark Jones. Both Oben and Jones rely on speed and technique rather than sheer size and strength, and both figure to know the moves of the other.\nJones anticipates he will have to come up with a new plan for Oben and is the process of formulating that plan.",

        "prompt": "(New York) – A new Amnesty International report released today urges Italy to overhaul a series of policies that contribute to the exploitation of migrant laborers by violating their right to work in just and favorable conditions and barring them access to justice.\nThe report, Exploited Labor: Migrant Workers in Italy’s Agricultural Sector, focuses on the severe exploitation of migrant workers from sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and Asia, employed in low-skilled, often seasonal or temporary jobs. Although the report focuses on the agricultural sector in the southern areas of Latina and Caserta, it notes that exploitation of migrant workers is widespread across Italy.\nItaly’s current migration policies control the number of migrants by criminalizing “illegal entry and stay.” Authorities allocate quotas for different types of workers, issuing residence permits based on a written contract of employment, but these quotas are much lower than the actual demand of migrant labor. This system, apart from being ineffective and open to abuse, also increases the risk of labor exploitation.\nEmployers prefer to hire workers already in the country regardless of the government entry quotas. Some seasonal workers may have expired papers, while others may have obtained entry visas through agencies but been unable to get residence permits due to lack of contracts. As a result, many migrant workers without valid papers are considered irregular migrants, and risk expulsion if caught.\nThe stigmatization of irregular migrant workers boosts xenophobia and discrimination against them. The reality for many workers is that if they complain about the labor exploitation to the authorities, they are immediately arrested, detained and expelled because of their irregular status.\nAt the beginning of 2011, there were an estimated 5.4 million foreign nationals in Italy – about 8.9percent of the population. Of these, 4.9 million have valid documents allowing them to stay in the country. It is estimated that there are around half a million migrants without valid documentation.\nMigrant workers in the agricultural and construction sectors in several areas of Southern Italy work long hours and receive, on average, about 40percent less than the pay of an Italian worker in the same job. They are composed of African and Asian migrants, some E.U.-nationals (mostly Bulgarians and Romanians) and non-E",

Researchers analyzed chemical isotopes in boulders that were left by advancing glaciers over the last 1,000 years in Southwestern Greenland and nearby Baffin Island. Evidence points to a different story where Vikings settled a far colder, icier Greenland.\nThe findings reveal that the Medieval Warm Period, a balmy season that Europe experienced from 950-1250, was not felt elsewhere, including Greenland. Records show that Vikings first sailed from Iceland to Greenland in 985. They settled there in the 10th Century and anywhere from 3,000-5,000 settlers lived on Greenland, farming and harvesting walrus ivory.\nThe research not only challenges climate theories about the time when Greenland was settled by Vikings, it also calls into question long-held beliefs about the disappearance of the Viking settlers a handful of generations later. It was once believed that the colonies, which vanished sometime between 1360 and 1460, succumbed to a colder climate. The Vikings’ disappearance was thought to have followed the onset of the so-",

Experts, however, have questioned this theory, noting the lack of early historical climate records from Greenland.\nWhile the disappearance of the colonies remains a mystery, other theories now include hostility with the native Inuit, a decline in ivory trade and soil erosion caused by the Vikings’ cattle.\nEuropeans did not re-inhabit Greenland until the 1700s.\nThe rocks were analyzed at the University of Buffalo, and at the Lamont-Doherty lab of geochemist and study coauthor Joerg Schaefer.

These internationally lauded musicians, specifically the Green Tour crew (the Red Tour crew tours the west coast), recently treated Pensacola to a two-hour celebration of Christmas music and lights in the Saenger Theatre. None of us who attended could reasonably be expected to contain ourselves over the holly and the jolly any longer, even though it happened before Thanksgiving.\n► What would be on your fantasy southern Thanksgiving menu?\nThe show was a bit confusing at first. Even though the opening piece, called \"Escape from the Atmosphere,\" was awesome, the video that ran on the screen behind the orchestra was space travel related. It included shuttle lift-offs, landings, astronauts and all the open space and stars we could handle. Gorgeous, yes. But Christmas-y? Nope. Not even a little bit.\nThen, Chip Davis, the creator and founder of Mannheim Steamroller, appeared on video to explain his decision and welcome us to the event. He also spoke in person later. Then, the line-up was typical of what you would expect in mainstream traditional Christmas music. While no, there were no renditions of \"I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas\" or \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,\" you’ll never hear a prettier performance of \"We Three Kings\" or \"Silent Night.\" It was so easy to close my eyes and allow the music to be everything.\nWhat my daughter, my friends and I couldn’t figure out, however, were the other videos which ran in the background for the rest of the performance. Most of them",

We’re talking adults dancing in mice costumes, desert scenes starring what looked like the musicians, and a royal couple waving from the top of a castle.\nI was, at times, reminded of a public school projection film from the 1970s. It certainly wasn’t enough to ruin the show for me, but I’ve seen some online reviews stating others were not so happy. ‘Tis the season, though, and I chose to throw myself into the spirit. I was there for the music.\nThis production got my Christmas season off to a delightful start. These wonderful musicians played their festive little hearts out for us. It was indeed a celebration, an event to be treasured with family and friends. I had both with me, and we were happy.\nFa la la, folks!

        "prompt": "The 2018 Toyota Sequoia has a roomy cabin and a potent engine with good low-end torque. This large SUV also has a near-perfect predicted reliability rating. However, the Sequoia is in desperate need of an interior redesign – a significant reason it has a midpack ranking.\nYes, the Toyota Sequoia is a good large SUV. Despite its bulkiness, the Sequoia delivers good handling and a comfortable ride. Its standard V8 engine has more than enough power to push this big SUV along as well. Adult passengers can fit comfortably in all three rows of seats, and cargo space is above average. There are plenty of standard driver assistance features as well. It was a finalist of our 2018 Best Large SUV for Families award because of its roomy cabin, long list of standard safety technology, and positive reviews from automotive critics.\nThat said, it's been a decade since the Sequoia's last redesign, and you can tell. Its infotainment system isn't as modern as many class rivals, and its cabin is full of low-quality materials. In terms of fuel economy, you don't expect much from such a large vehicle, but the Sequoia's fuel economy ratings are low even by class standards.\nChoosing to buy the Sequoia comes down to your priorities. Not only is the Sequoia priced competitively, but it also has a longer standard features list than many rivals, making it a great value. However, the Sequoia isn't very modern. If you find that unappealing, you might want to skip this SUV for one that better suits your needs.\nThe Nissan Armada and GMC Yukon offer less interior space, but they both have better fuel economy estimates and more upscale interiors. The Yukon also offers more advanced infotainment features.\nThe current generation of the Sequoia debuted a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Just kidding – it was 2008. Still, that means it's been a decade since the Sequoia has seen a redesign. However, there are some new standard advanced safety features and a brand-new TRD Sport trim for the 2018 model year. Otherwise, there have been no major changes to the Sequoia since its 2008 redesign. You can likely save thousands of dollars by shopping for a Sequoia from an earlier model year.\nIf you're interested in a used model, visit our overviews of the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Toyota Sequoia. Also, check out our Used Car Deals page to learn about incentives on used vehicles.\nThis 2018 Toyota Sequoia uses relevant research and data from the 2008 through 2018 model years.\nThe Sequoia has a starting price of just over $48,000, which is on the high end for the class, but not by a lot. The new-for-2018 TRD Sport trim starts at around $51,100. It doesn’t have as many tech and convenience features, but it does have features to make the ride feel (and look) sportier, and you can't get them in any other Sequoia trim.\nThe higher trims are the Limited (starting around $57,000) and the Platinum (starting around $64,000). These trims have all the bells and whistles when it comes to infotainment, comfort, and convenience features. As you can see, they cost a lot more than the lower trims, but they’re less expensive than the highest trims of some rivals.\nAlthough the Nissan Armada ranks near the bottom of the large SUV class, it has one of the lowest starting prices in the segment. The Armada is an easily maneuverable SUV with a powerful V8 engine, and it has a higher towing capacity than the Sequoia. It also has a more modern interior with upscale materials. However, the Sequoia is a better choice if cabin space is a main priority. The Armada suffers from a cramped third row, while the Sequoia's third row has enough space for adults. Unfortunately, both SUVs have outdated infotainment systems. If you want more space and much better predicted reliability, go with the Toyota. Otherwise, the Armada is worth considering.\nWhich Is Better: Toyota Sequoia or GMC Yukon?\nThe GMC Yukon has one of the most upscale interiors in the class. It has tons of advanced technology, including a standard Wi-Fi hot spot, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay. It also has better gas mileage estimates than the Sequoia. The Yukon has a stronger base engine and a higher towing capacity than the Sequoia. However, the Sequoia has a roomier third row, more cargo space, and much better predicted reliability. Unless interior opulence or towing capability are top priorities, the Sequoia is most likely a better choice for most needs.\nThe base Sequoia seats eight, and available second-row captain’s chairs drop seating capacity to seven. The interior is spacious, as are all three rows of seats. The front seats have plenty of support, and the second and third rows recline so your passengers will have an easier time getting comfortable.\nThere are three complete sets of LATCH car-seat connectors on the second-row bench seat, but the system hasn't been evaluated for its ease of use.\nRivals have nicer interiors than this Toyota. The design isn’t stylish or modern, and there are plenty of hard plastics throughout, making this large SUV feel more like a work truck than a family vehicle.\nThis Toyota has more cargo space than most of its rivals. There’s just under 19 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, which is enough room for a large dog or more than a dozen pieces of carry-on luggage. Fold down all the seats for just over 120 cubic feet of space. That’s enough room to haul a desk, a small couch, or just about anything else that you can get through the hatch.\nStandard features in the Sequoia include tri-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, a USB port, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and an Entune infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touch screen, Siri Eyes Free, and navigation linked to a smartphone app. Available features include a 14-speaker JBL audio system, a rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system, integrated navigation, and the Entune app suite.\nThe Sequoia’s infotainment tech lags behind most rivals’. While the Entune system is user-friendly, the controls are hard to reach, and the system is a little out of date. Unlike many rivals, the Sequoia doesn’t offer Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\nThe Sequoia features a 381-horsepower V8 engine. This engine is powerful, and there is plenty of torque. This leads to surprisingly energetic acceleration when you mash the pedal down. The automatic transmission delivers smooth, timely shifts.\nThe Sequoia gets bad gas mileage, even compared to the other SUVs in this class. It earns just 13 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on the highway. You'll save about $150 per year in gas money by driving the Nissan Armada instead of the Sequoia and about $550 per year by instead driving the GMC Yukon.\nThe Sequoia is far from nimble, but it doesn’t feel overwhelmed on winding pavement. The steering and handling are both reasonably precise. The ride is smooth no matter what the pavement looks like, and the adaptive air suspension in the Platinum trim further improves that smoothness. A new-for-2018 TRD Sport trim comes with Bilstein shocks tuned to give a sportier ride.\nYou’re probably not buying a behemoth like the Sequoia because you want to tear it up away from the pavement. But if you enjoy venturing off-road, the Sequoia won’t let you down. It has great ground clearance, and it's available with four-wheel drive.\nThe Sequoia has a respectable towing capacity of 7,400 pounds. Still, other large SUVs can pull more weight.\nThe 2018 Toyota Sequoia has an above-average predicted reliability rating of 4.5 out of five from J.D. Power. That's one of the highest ratings in the class.\nToyota covers the Sequoia with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Those are the same warranty terms you’ll find with most other large SUVs.\nThe 2018 Sequoia has not been fully crash tested as of this writing, but it earns four out of five stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s rollover test.\nStandard driver assistance features include a rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, lane change assist, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross traffic alert, and Toyota Safety Sense, which includes forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, and adaptive cruise control.\nThere are four Sequoia trims (SR5, TRD Sport, Limited, and Platinum), all of which come standard with a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive. You can add four-wheel drive to any trim for $3,225. Choosing the right trim comes down to what you need from your Sequoia.\nIf you’re OK with seating for eight and missing out on some high-end entertainment features, then the base SR5 is a great option. It saves you money compared to the higher trims, and it still comes well-equipped. If you want features like second-row captain’s chairs, a JBL audio system, and a rear-seat entertainment system, then you’ll have to look at the higher trims. Between the two top trims, we recommend the Limited. It offers almost everything you can get it in the top-of-the-line Platinum, but while almost every feature comes standard in the Platinum, several are optional in the Limited. This lets you pick and choose some of the features you want, without paying for the ones you don't.\nThe Sequoia SR5 is the lowest trim, and it has a base price of $48,400. It comes standard with tri-zone automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, lane change assist, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross traffic alert, Toyota Safety Sense, a moonroof, a USB port, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and the Entune infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touch screen, Siri Eyes Free, and navigation linked to a smartphone app. For $3,810, you can add the Premium package, which includes leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable front seats, a power-reclining third row, and a power liftgate.\nThe Sequoia TRD Sport is a brand new trim for the 2018 model year, and it has a starting price of $51,115. The TRD Sport is slightly sportier than the other trims, and it comes with 20-inch wheels, Bilstein shocks, anti-sway bars, and second-row captain’s chairs. This trim doesn’t have any option packages.\nThe Sequoia Limited starts at $56,895. The Limited comes with a power liftgate, integrated navigation, leather seats, heated front seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat, and power-folding third-row seats. For $300, you can get second-row captain’s chairs. The JBL audio system costs $1,250. Adding the rear-seat Blu-ray",
        "baseline": " entertainment system costs $1,920.\nThe Sequoia Platinum is the highest trim, and it carries a starting price of $64,110. The Platinum comes with an adaptive air suspension, a 14-speaker JBL audio system, a rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system, and heated second-row captain’s chairs. There are no option packages with this trim because it comes standard with almost everything you can get in a Sequoia.\nThe 2018 Toyota Sequoia is a good large SUV that finishes in the middle of our class rankings. It has many of the things buyers want, like a powerful engine and plenty of space for passengers and cargo. However, it hasn’t been redesigned in years, so many rivals look and feel more modern and provide newer tech features. This Toyota is worth a look, but you should definitely comparison shop before you buy.\nCalculate 2018 Toyota Sequoia Monthly Payment Which Cars You Can Afford?",

        "prompt": "In western San Luis Valley near the town of South Fork, passengers can enjoy a unique railroad experience. It is at trip at 12 miles per hour in a motorcar along the historic Creede Branch of the former Denver & Rio Grande Western Railway.\nThe branch was constructed as a narrow gauge line in 1883 ending at Wagon Wheel Gap, a resort designed for the wealthy. Just 10 miles away, the silver mines at Creede began to produce large quantities of ore. There was pressure to extend the line, but despite this, the railroad lacked the financial resources. In 1891, financier David Moffat formed the Rio Grande Gunnison Railway and laid the tracks into mining area in North Creede. Moffat leased his railroad, and he was told he would never get his money back in freight receipts. After just three months, Moffat's investment was paid for, and in 1908, he sold it to the Denver & Rio Grande Western.\nRailroad: Denver & Rio Grande Railway.\nWhere: Western San Luis Valley.\nWhat: Motorcar takes passengers along the historic Creede Branch of the former Denver & Rio Grande Western Railway.\nIn 1902, the Creede Branch was converted from narrow gauge to standard gauge to allow ore trains to flow directly to distant smelters. Freight continued to move over this branch until 1977 when the last train entered Creede. The line sat abandoned until Donald H. Shank formed the Denver & Rio Grande Railway Historical Foundation in 1997. Just three years later, all of the right of way and track was purchased up to the Creede city limits.\nNow in its fourth summer of operation, a great deal of work is being done on the track. Many of the old ties are being replaced, ballast added and culverts repaired. The railroad has two motorcars to take tourists on a bumpy, but scenic ride to Wagon Wheel Gap. A distinct advantage of such an operation is that the motorman will stop upon request for photographs.\nThe railroad travels through forests, across meadows, past campgrounds, over trestles, then passes by historic structures including the privately owned Wagon Wheel Gap depot. Towering volcanic cliffs add to the scenic nature of this trip. Wildlife abounds and moose, deer and",
        "baseline": " bear have all been seen along the track. Restroom stops are made and for lunch the motorcar stops by one of two lodges located near the track.\nThe Denver & Rio Grande Railway operates from Memorial Day to the first weekend in October on a daily basis. The depot is located a half mile north of U.S. 160 along Colorado 149. Trains leave for Wagon Wheel Gap at 10 a.m. and again at 3 p.m. By request, customers can purchase tickets that will take them to past Wagon Wheel Gap to Wasson, located within sight of Creede. Call 719-873-2003 for information and reservations to enjoy this important part of Colorado railroad history.\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965.

        "prompt": "Phil Gramm is in the headlines today–being slammed by Democrats and disavowed by the McCain campaign–for complaining to The Washington Times that “we have sort of become a nation of whiners.” Gramm, who chairs John McCain’s campaign and who advises the presumptive Republican nominee on economic matters, pooh-poohed talk of a recession: “You’ve heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession.” The former Republican Senator and current vice president of Swiss bank UBS dismissed talk of US economic woes and declared, “We’ve never been more dominant; we’ve never had more natural advantages than we have today. We have benefited greatly” from globalization.\nBut as this tempest was under way, another Gramm story went little noticed: a top McCain aide indirectly implicated Gramm in the current economic mess.\nWell, I think there was a situation where there was greed on Wall Street, there was a lack of transparency around a new set of financial instruments, there were a whole new set of financial instruments, there were a whole new set of financial players who were less regulated than banks, and all that together created a situation, which now is rippling through the economy.\nToday’s economic troubles, Fiorina was saying, were caused in part by insufficient regulation and lack of transparency regarding the latest financial instruments. And who bears some responsibility for that? Phil Gramm.\nIt was Gramm who used a sly legislative maneuver in late 2000, when he chaired the Senate banking committee, to pass the",

The federal government shutdown could create a lapse in section 8 vouchers, impacting local families.\nCurrently, the section 8 vouchers our local government offices in Tampa Bay issue are funded through February, but some local non-profits are set to run out of money in just a few weeks.\nKirk Ray Smith has a mission: to help others, no matter the cost.\n“I think you have an obligation to meet that need and not doing that, well, I don’t know how humanitarian that is,” Smith explained.\nHis Clearwater non-profit agency R.C.S. (Religious Community Services) runs a food bank and also helps survivors of domestic violence have a safe place to live. Yet, the federal funding they rely on to carry out their mission could vanish in less than 3 weeks. On Monday, R.C.S. received notification that $25,000 used to fund their food banks would also not immediately be reimbursed because of the government shutdown.\n“If the shut down doesn’t end soon, we’re looking at several months of invoices that will not be paid,” Smith said with a sigh.\nEven if that means scrambling to find the money to pay their rent out of the non",

If the government shutdown lingers, some experts worry landlords will grow impatient and evict tenants who don’t receive section 8 checks to cover their rent.\nAcross the United States, 5 million families rely on section 8 vouchers to keep a roof over their heads.

        "prompt": "\"We have a great thing going right now. We just wanted to win this game tonight,\" Sykora said. \"We didn't really look ahead. Now we're going back home. We've got nothing to lose. We know what we have to do and hopefully we can bring it back here to Detroit.\"\nThe Red Wings, who fell to 9-2 at home in the postseason, gave the Penguins their first loss in Pittsburgh on Saturday in Game 4 to set up their championship chances.\nEarly on, a Penguins' win in this one seemed likely after they scored twice in the first period and carried a 2-1 lead into the third. However, the Red Wings tied it on Pavel Datsyuk's power-play goal at 6:43 and went ahead for the first time 2:40 later when Brian Rafalski scored.\nThe party was on in the final minute. Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury was on the bench, the Pittsburgh net was empty and the seconds ticked down toward Detroit's fourth Stanley Cup championship in 11 seasons.\nMaxime Talbot put the fans back into their seats when he saved the Penguins' season with a second whack of the puck at the left post with 34.3 seconds left in regulation. Fleury kept them alive with a brilliant 55-save effort, including 24 in overtime.\nNow, the treasured trophy will go back into its crate and head to Pennsylvania where the Red Wings will have another shot at their 11th title in franchise history.\nSykora's goal ended the fifth-longest game in Stanley Cup finals history. The second assist went to defenseman Sergei Gonchar, who missed the first two overtime periods after crashing headfirst into the end boards in the second period. Gonchar took the ice to help Pittsburgh's struggling power play.\n\"The game was so long. I wanted to help our guys,\" Gonchar said. \"I started feeling better at the end of the second overtime, so I thought there was a chance. Anyway I could help, I had to come back, so the goal was wait until the power play. They put me on the ice for the power play and we scored.\"\nThat unit finally clicked on its fifth chance — including two in overtime — after converting only twice in 17 chances during the first four games.\nRoad teams have won 10 of the past 12 overtime games in the finals and are 15-4 since 1990.\nMarian Hossa and Adam Hall put the Penguins in that position by scoring 6:04 apart in the first.\nDarren Helm cut Detroit's deficit in half in the second, and the raucous home crowd was primed to carry the Red Wings home in the third. Datsyuk struck for the tying goal 22 seconds after Tyler Kennedy went off for hooking, the Red Wings' first power-play goal in four chances on the night.\nBy then, the chants of \"We Want the Cup\" filled the old rink. Penguins coach Michel Therrien called his timeout with 11:41 remaining, but it would have been helpful just 1:04 later when Rafalski put the Penguins on the brink of elimination.\nJohan Franzen sent a pass out front to Rafalski, who skated in from the right point and ripped a drive through a crowd in the crease and into the net. It was Rafalski's third goal of the playoffs.\nThe bubbly was certainly on ice when Talbot — the extra skater on for Fleury — tied it.\nHossa swept a pass from the corner that bounced off Osgood's left leg and came to Talbot. With a second jab, he got the puck through. The Penguins bench erupted in celebration as Red Wings players skated slowly as they realized how close they had come.\nThe Red Wings outshot the Penguins 13-2 in the first overtime and kept the puck in the Pittsburgh end for most of it. Detroit, however, took the only penalty but killed it off without much difficulty.\nFleury knocked aside Datsyuk's drive 6½ minutes into overtime and then fought off a rebound try by Valtteri Filppula. Tomas Holmstrom, who returned from a one-game absence caused by an injured hamstring, got the puck while he was alone in the slot only to have his spin-o-rama attempt kept out by the Penguins' 23-year-old netminder.\nPittsburgh's best early overtime chance came from Evgeni Malkin, the MVP finalist, who earned the first assist on the winning goal for his first point in the series. Malkin took a pass from Jarkko Ruutu as he came off the bench and fired a drive from the right circle that bounced off Osgood's arm before he gloved it.\nEach team received a power play in the second overtime, and both penalties came in the offensive zone.\nPittsburgh earned its second goalie interference penalty after regulation when Dan Cleary drove hard to the net and bumped",
        "baseline": " Fleury near the right post. The Red Wings failed to get a shot on Fleury after Sykora hooked Niklas Kronwall in front of the Detroit net following a scoring chance.\nFleury remained sharp and made 20 saves through two overtimes. He kept his cool even after losing sight of the puck, which popped over him and landed on top of the net.\nWith Joe Louis Arena decked out in red and ready to rock, the Penguins drained the juice out of the old rink in the first period.\nHall's goal was particularly deflating because the puck was shot into the net by Kronwall with 5:19 left in the period.\nDetroit seemed poised to end the series on home ice, where the Red Wings outscored the Penguins a combined 7-0 in the first two games of the series.\nBut just as they did in the Western Conference finals against Dallas, the Presidents' Trophy winners dropped Game 5 with a chance to wrap things up.",

Many of its 2016 awards nominations went to small arty films like “Trumbo,” “Carol” and other off-beat pictures. Popular movies like “Creed,” “The Martian,” “Bridge of Spies” and Jennifer Lawrence’s uplifting “Joy” got short shrift.\n“Trumbo” a biographical drama film directed by Jay Roach and written by John McNamara, led with three nominations.\nThe film, about a black-listed Hollywood writer, stars Bryan Cranston, who was nominated for best actor. Co-star Helen Mirren was tapped for best supporting actress. The film itself was nominated for best ensemble cast, which is equivalent to best picture.\nJohnny Depp in “Black Mass,” Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Revenant,” Michael Fassbender in “Steve Jobs” and Eddie Redmayne in “The Danish Girl” all received best actor nods.\nProbably the biggest snub goes to Lawrence and “Joy,” despite a powerful performance and a strong cast that includes Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro. The film was shut out.\nIn another surprise snub, neither Hanks nor his film “Bridge of Spies,” received any nominations, save for Mark Rylance’s nomination for a supporting role. He plays a Russian spy in the movie.\nKristen Stewart was also left out for her role in “Clouds of Sils Maria,” a dramatic film about the intersecting lives of a younger and older woman. She won a French Cesar Award, the equivalent of an Oscar, for best supporting actress.\n“The Martian,” starring Matt Damon, was critically acclaimed, but science fiction rarely does well at awards shows.

        "prompt": "Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine being a religious liberal. You view the Bible primarily as a fable. You check the \"Christian\" box when asked your religion, but you don't associate with anyone who takes the Bible literally. You hope your followers vote against the Republican candidate. And then here comes Mitt Romney as the one chosen to oppose the \"chosen one.\"\nThis presents a real dilemma for those on the religious left. It is not part of their practice to articulate biblical doctrine in too much detail. It all must be kept incredibly vague and inclusive. The minute a person on the religious left allows himself to get too specific about doctrine, he starts to feel way too much like an absolutist. Somebody gets left out.\nMany on the religious left today are \"Christian\" in the same sense that America is a \"Christian\" nation. It is a label that gains you a following and a measure of respectability and status. It is not intended to mean that you believe in Christianity literally, say the way that Muslims or Mormons believe their respective religions present literal history and literal truth. For the religious left, it is more of a figurative approach to their \"faith.\" Christian \"mythology\" is meant to teach some good life lessons, but not to prescribe the rightness and wrongness of anyone else's doctrine.\nMitt Romney has committed his soul to a religious organization that has a specific history and many controversial doctrines. This poses a problem for the religious left. How do they discredit the man's policies without being asked questions about the history or doctrines of his religion? If they are asked specifically about those things, how in the world are they to respond? Those issues are way outside of their comfort zone.\nThe biggest area of nervousness, however, really has to do with their own \"faith.\" If they allow themselves to compare the history of Mormon doctrine to the history of Christianity, they are allowing themselves to view Christianity as more than a fable. Everyone knows that Mormonism is not a fable. It is a fact of recent history, just as the Jehovah's Witnesses are a fact of recent history.\nThose on the religious left don't want to wrestle with this essential aspect of Christianity. It makes it all too real. It brings heaven and hell into the picture, as well as sin and the Savior. It leads people to say there are true prophets and false prophets. Do you honestly think, then, anyone on the religious left would ever identify Mormon founder Joseph Smith as a false prophet?\nYou won't hear the religious left label people as false prophets because that is too exclusive. That results in \"right",

The only exception is when it comes to those who interpret Scripture literally and take Jesus at His Word about being the only Way to heaven. For some illogical reason, the religious left view these Christian \"literalists\" as fair game for criticism. Hmm. So much for a principled position.\nIn the end, what is one to do with Mitt Romney? If you are part of the religious left, you tiptoe very gingerly around this candidate. If he gets the nomination, you freely criticize his financial policies and other policy matters. But you steer clear of his Mormon beliefs. That topic will only make a religious liberal start sweating.\nDan Delzell is the pastor of Wellspring Lutheran Church in Papillion, Neb.

One of the station’s reporters asked Trump whether a building he owned – 40 Wall Street, a few blocks from the site of the attacks – had suffered any damage.\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat tracks skyscrapers around the world. As of this moment, Trump’s building at 40 Wall Street, called the Trump Building, is the 32nd-tallest building that either stands in New York City or is slated to be built there.\nMany of the 66 tallest buildings or planned buildings aren’t in Lower Manhattan, generally defined as below 14th Street. Trump said downtown Manhattan, which is generally considered to be the same area. The tallest building in that lower part of the island is the tallest building in the city – and the Western Hemisphere: One World Trade Center, the building that replaced the twin towers.\nThat building, of course, wasn’t in Lower Manhattan on the day of the attacks. It’s a remarkable testament to the recent economic boom in New York City that so few of the 66 tallest buildings were in existence in late 2001. Only 15 of them were, including Trump’s building on Wall Street.\nMany of the new additions aren’t in Lower Manhattan but, instead, in Midtown or on the southern end of Central Park.\nOf those four buildings, Trump’s ranked second in height, by 25 feet, to a building one block to the east (70 Pine).\nThere was a period during which Trump’s was the tallest building in Lower Manhattan, but it wasn’t immediately before the construction",
        "baseline": " of the World Trade Center in the 1970s. It was for about two years in the 1930s, well before Trump owned it – or was born.\nObviously, that Trump chose to focus on his building’s newly elevated status on the day of the attacks themselves was odd. (One WWOR reporter who was there at the time used the word “stunned” to describe how he felt in the moment.) But it’s hardly unusual that Trump should make such a claim, and it’s not unusual that the claim should be inaccurate.\nTo that end, 40 Wall Street joins several other Trump exaggerations or falsehoods about the 9/11 attacks, including that he “helped a little bit” with cleaning up Ground Zero or that he saw Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the towers’ destruction. The attacks of Sept. 11 play an outsize role in the American imagination. And, it seems, in Trump’s.",

In March, Senator Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, maintained the funding cut would cause a 25 percent reduction in the government’s mine-safety inspection workforce. As of March, 612 federal mine inspectors were responsible for enforcing safety regulations in 25 states, and there were signs the system has not been functioning well.\nLast September, thirteen workers died in a coal mine 2,140 feet below Brookwood, Alabama. A spark caused by a rock hitting a piece of machinery ignited a methane-fueled inferno. The disaster, coming 12 days after September 11, did not draw much media notice. But it did prompt serious criticism of the MSHA. In March, the United Mine Workers of America accused the MSHA of treating “serious violations such as thousands of feet of combustible materials…and disruptions in the mine’s ventilation system (which can lead to mine explosions)” at the Brookwood site as “minor infractions.” The union claimed that federal inspectors failed to return to check on violations at this mine, which is owned by Walter Industries, that the MSHA did not respond to “requests by the miners for increased inspections when serious hazards existed,” that the MSHA provided the company advance notice of inspection locations, and that a “MSHA supervisor divert[ed] an inspector away from an area of the mine that had known ventilation problems just prior to the explosion.” At the time of the explosion, the mine had 31 outstanding violations and federal inspectors had not bothered to determine whether they had been corrected. As of mid-July, the MSHA had not responded to these accusations.\nThe Bush administration’s less-than-ardent concern for mine safety is in step with its",

Fretting about regulatory burdens and calling for flexible standards, the Bush crowd has demonstrated more empathy with business owners than with workers.

The White House has also decreased funding for the National Institute for Occupational Safety. And it deep-sixed workplace safety rules for ergonomics, replacing them with voluntary guidelines for certain industries.\nYet there was Bush–with Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and MSHA administrator David Lauriski in tow–basking in the glow of the mine workers, while saying nothing about mine safety issues.

Led by one of The Crimson's polling experts, this seminar will review some of The Crimson's largest survey efforts as well as other initiatives to provide readers with real data.\nHow to Launch an Initiative: Investigative Case Study Since its founding, The Crimson has launched many initiatives to expand its presence and content in the ever-changing field of journalism. The Crimson launched the Flyby blog in 2009, which has continued to provide another outlet for more loosely written, but still well-reported and more opinionated content. This seminar will focus on The Crimson’s most recent initiative to launch a blog on College Admissions and use that project as a case study for how to create and successfully launch your own initiatives.\nThe Making of a Magazine: Alternative Ways To Tell a Story In this seminar, editors of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes, will discuss ways to present campus issues using non-­traditional narrative forms. Students will analyze and critique the effectiveness of various pieces from recent issues of the magazine and brainstorm ways of framing stories for their own papers.\nTelling Stories That Move Audiences: New Medium of Journalistic Videos A well­-made video can tell an engaging story on its own or can serve as a valuable complement to a traditional article. In this seminar, participants will learn the basics of creating a video and discuss how to incorporate more innovative multimedia components into their newspapers’ coverage.\nNewspaper 2.0: Online Strategy Newspapers’ main sources of readership have shifted online, and drawing more users to their websites is a never­ending quest. This seminar will introduce a number of features of The Crimson’s own online strategy, including web page analytics, online advertising, and The Crimson’s recent website redesign, and its newest initiative for multimedia features.\nDesign: Constructive Feedback on your School Newspaper In this seminar, Crimson editors will talk about the evolution of design within The Crimson. The seminar will introduce students to trends in both print and online design.\nCareers in Technology and Start-ups In this seminar, students will have an opportunity to discuss career paths in technology and start-ups, from internships in high school to college and beyond, with members of the Harvard Crimson Technology Board. Many of the Crimson’s Tech Board members have worked in prestigious technology and start-up companies, from Google to Dropbox, and have insights into what these companies are looking for in students, stories about tech and start-up work culture, and advice about the future options open to students interested in this line of work.\nIntroduction to Python Learn the basics of Python, a widely-used and flexible programming language, with the Harvard Crimson’s Directors of Web Development. Students will get a taste of what it’s like to be in a Harvard undergraduate Computer Science class as well as get insights into the academic options open to students interested in programming in college and beyond.\nLearning Adobe Software: Photoshop and InDesign In this seminar, students will learn the basics of Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, particularly as it is applicable to publication design, with members of the Harvard Crimson’s Design Board. Students will get a chance to learn not only how to use these programs, but also how to design in a way that is most engaging for the viewer.\nCareers in Business In this seminar, students will have an opportunity to discuss career paths in business, from finance and consulting to real estate, with members of the Harvard Crimson Business Board. Students on the Crimson Business Board have worked in prestigious companies from Goldman Sachs to McKinsey, and have insights into what these companies are looking for in student employment, what kind of work culture these fields have to offer, and what young students can do to competitively prepare for a career in these sectors.\nAlternative Revenue For a student group to maintain financial stability, developing and maintaining alternative revenue sources is crucial. In this seminar turned round table discussion, attending students in leadership positions will receive a talk from the Manager of the Harvard Crimson Business Board about the innovative ways in which the Crimson has generated alternative revenue, from contract printing to publishing popular books such as 50 Successful Harvard Application Essays. Then, students will be given a chance to come together in small group discussions to collectively brainstorm alternative revenue ideas for their own student organizations.\nSocial Media Marketing As newspapers’ main source of readership has shifted online, social media marketing has become all the more crucial to attracting and keeping a readership. Come and discuss with the leaders of the Harvard Crimson’s Marketing team as well as the Crimson’s Managing Editor how a student newspaper can stay relevant in today’s readership landscape by employing social media marketing tactics.\nField Reporting Exercise Students will have an opportunity to practice their reporting skills by interviewing students, tourists, and locals on campus and in the surrounding area. Students will engage with real ­life issues that students and Cambridge citizens face while gaining valuable hands-­on training by reporting in the field.\nPhotography Excursion In this activity, students will venture out into campus as a group with one of The Crimson’s photographers to capture their own shots of historic Harvard buildings in the square, scenic views on the Charles River, and colorful city life in the Square.\nMock Editorial Meeting The staff editorial is a key part of The Crimson’s Ed Board, and our Editorial Chairs will lead students through a mock editorial meeting. Students will be presented with a set of common controversial school issues up for discussion, and through the course of the meeting, students will debate both sides of each topic and formulate nuanced arguments for potential staff editorials.\nSensitive Stories: The Ethics of Journalism In this discussion, students will engage in a number of key questions relating to journalistic ethics, including what constitutes libel, anonymous sourcing, and how to cover sensitive issues such as sexual assault, discipline cases, and mental health. As these stories have risen to the forefront of many schools' best reporting, their importance cannot be underplayed.\nRoundtable Discussion: Responsibilities of the EIC Managing editor Angela N.

Those items bring a sense of comfort whenever we are on our journey.\nIf though those are essentials, you can live without those, you just may not be happy about it. There are a few things that you do need to have with you, no matter where you go. Let’s take a look.\nWhether you ’re an intermittent traveler, a globetrotter or a backpacker you need to consider your main luggage or backpack as an essential. Think of it as your very own home. See it as your very own personal space that houses every possession you have while you are away from your home sweet home.\nIt should be as sturdy as it can get and have enough space for your current item and possibly souvenirs. Make sure it is also waterproof because the weather can be pretty unpredictable.\nStow away important documents in the most protected pocket in the bag like your passport, money, visa and especially your insurance certificate. It is important to have insurance coverage because the traveling life is full of surprises, pleasant and unpleasant. If your trip get canceled or delayed, you don’t need to panic because help is just an email or phone call away.\nPlan this piece carefully because some airlines limit the type of luggage you have. Smart luggage is often banned, even though they’re pretty amazing. Make sure that it is easy to manage too. The last thing you want when you land is to be lost, trying to find where to go, and have a piece of luggage that doesn’t want to cooperate.\nIt should not necessarily be a smartphone, but it could be any electronic gadget that can allow you to communicate with the world. It could be your laptop, tablet, smartwatch or digital camera. This is an essential item, not just because you can show off your travels on social media. If you are traveling somewhere new, you will want something with a GPS. A phone comes in handy because you can Google your destination, or find a nearby restaurant, or find your hotel. The battery life is important because it does no good if its dead. You may want to invest in a new phone before you travel. Also, if you have Netflix, you can use it while your travel.\nWe all have preference in clothes, styling, and whatnot, especially in our personal toiletry items. You can use those provided by our hotel, but you won’t know if they are compatible with your skin until you’ve tried it. No one wants a big bad acne breakout while in the city.

        "prompt": "Cat lovers, rejoice: a new study has found that cats are living longer, healthier lives.\nIn this month’s Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, researchers broke down what it looks like to be an aging cat in this day and age. They found that improvements in diets and healthcare have extended the life expectancy of the humble housecat.\nToday, pet cats are living until their late teens or early 20s (the human equivalent of 100 years old). In fact, more than 20 percent of the cats we see around today were 11 years or older in 2011, researchers estimate.\nBut while it’s clear to see that cats are living longer, it’s more challenging to define what it looks like to be an over-the-hill cat in today’s society.\nWhile cats may be outdoing their ancestors in the age department, not much is known about what healthy aging looks like. In an 18-page review of existing research on aging in cats, researchers attempted to categorize traits of normal aging versus signs of disease.\n\"An appreciation of normal aging in cats is critical",
        "baseline": " from both a clinical and research perspective. In this regard, it is imperative to be able to distinguish between what would be considered 'normal for age' [versus] unhealthy aging changes,\" the team wrote.\nSome signs of normal aging include reduced grooming behavior, a slightly thinned coat, some weight loss. Physical symptoms that don’t affect the cat’s quality of life are generally considered normal.\nOn the other hand, signs of musculoskeletal problems could include trouble jumping or moving, while respiratory problems may be marked by wheezing or trouble breathing normally.\nWhile the paper was intended to be an informative guide for veterinarians, researchers acknowledge the fact that there is more to be learned about aging cats.\n\"Although we provide a thorough review of the current knowledge, it is clear that there is a great need for better understanding in this area.\"\nThe full review, “Evaulating Aging in Cats,” can be read here.",

Two USDA and one Nature Conservancy scientists are housed in the department and hold lecturer (WOS) appointments. By 2006, three faculty and two CE specialists will exceed the age of 65.\nNo changes in the areas themselves although significant technological advances are significantly expanding the available approaches.\nOur faculty have consistently been at the forefront of basic and applied research in the above areas. Two of them have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and last year, one received the Maserati-Florio World Prize. Faculty in the department have been awarded federal funds to establish the C. M. Rick Tomato Genetic Resource Center, UC Davis Advanced Plant Genetics Facility, UC Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education Program, UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility, UC Davis Core Greenhouse Facility, and Louis K. Mann Laboratory for Postharvest Research. Our faculty serve as the directors of these facilities and other research centers including the UC Biotechnology Training Program in Rhizosphere Signaling, the UC Davis Seed Biotechnology Center, the Small Farm Center, the Vegetable Research and Information Center, and the Weed Research and Information Center. The departmental members are key participants in the internationally recognized Postharvest Technology Short Course, now in its 21st year, and the Weed Science School, now in its fourth year. The department also hosts the USDA Aquatic Weed Research Program and the weed program of The Nature Conservancy. The Department of Vegetable Crops and Weed Science will continue to provide leadership and to garner support for activities in these areas.\nDirect cost expenditures were $2,973,902 and $2,446,593 for 1997-98 and 1998-99, respectively. Sources for this funding include NSF, USDA, DOE, DANR, and numerous foundations, commodity boards, and industry sources. These figures do not include faculty activities administered outside the department (e.g., through CEPRAP). The grant funds are distributed across all the program areas.\nFaculty in the department have been instrumental in creating the new plant biology undergraduate major and offering a specialization in applied plant biology. This major is listed by both CA&ES and the College of Letters and Sciences (DBS) and is accessible to students through either college. In addition, we have been instrumental in developing and teaching in the biotechnology, agricultural systems and environment, and crop science and management majors. The student credit hours recorded to our faculty were 3,052 and 2,723 for 1997-98 and 1998-99, respectively. At the M.S. level, our department was a major driving force for the merger of the Master' Programs in vegetable crops, horticulture and agronomy to form the Graduate Group in Horticulture and Agronomy. At the Ph. D. level, members of the Department of Vegetable Crops are active in the Graduate Groups in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Community Development, Ecology, Education, Food Science, Genetics, International Agricultural Development, Plant Biology, Plant Protection and Pest Management, and Soil Science; they teach core courses in these curricula and serve on executive, admission, fellowship, seminar, qualifying exam and thesis committees.\nThe Centers for Vegetable Research & Information, Weed Research & Information, Seed Biotechnology and Postharvest Physiology provide a focus for outreach activities in their respective disciplines and continue to organize workshops and short-courses that are attended by the university community, state and federal agencies, and private industry.

        "prompt": "CHICAGO – Monday night’s crisis point came with 3:33 left in the third period.\nThat’s when Notre Dame star Arike Ogunbowale, facing Stanford in the last regional final of her college career, headed to the bench after picking up her third personal foul and second in a span of two minutes.\nHaving whittled a nine-point deficit to three, the Irish needed to find a way to push through in the second-team All-American’s absence. Jackie Young showed the way, just as her big brother knew she would.\nThe former Princeton High School star, still the state’s all-time prep scoring leader for boys or girls, had eight points on 2-of-9 shooting at that moment. Young finished with a game-high 25 as the Irish surged to their seventh Final Four in nine seasons.\nSeven of Young’s points came with Arike on the bench in those waning minutes of the third quarter as the defending national champions set up another showdown with longtime rival Connecticut. That will take place on Friday night in Tampa, where Baylor and Oregon will play in the other national semifinal.\nFirst, Young found senior Brianna Turner for the first of two straight baskets. Then the 6-foot junior guard got serious, scoring seven of the Irish’s final nine points, most on drives to the basket against the smaller Stanford guards.\n“We just had to stay together, play our game and do what we do best, and that’s go in transition,\" Young said. \"I was getting to the basket the whole time. I just wasn’t hitting shots in the beginning.\"\nThe key, she said, was \"just keeping an aggressive mindset and attacking the basket.” If she kept shooting, she added, “I knew eventually shots were going to fall.\"\nBefore Young keyed that third-quarter surge, Notre Dame hadn’t led since 17-16 with seven minutes left in the first half. Once the Irish nudged ahead at 45-44, they would soon take control of the game against the second-seeded Cardinal.\nNotre Dame scored 13 of the final 17 points in the quarter and would go on to shoot 71 percent in the second half after shooting just 26 percent before the break.\n\"We knew we had to get our stuff together,\" said Young, named a third-team All-American along with teammate Jessica Shepard earlier Monday. \"We had 20 minutes left. We just had to play a little bit harder. We just changed our mindset in the second half.\"\nMeeting on the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time in five years, Notre Dame and Stanford experienced another game of extreme runs. After blowing a 16-point second-half lead two years ago and rallying from 15 down only to fall short in Ogunbowale’s freshman year, Notre Dame made sure to finish the job this time.\n“Arike got the third foul, and we went to Jackie and she just took over the game,” Irish coach Muffet McGraw said.\nFreshman guard Abby Prohaska, who provided four points and a spark off the bench, also earned praise from McGraw for her work in that tenuous span.\nOgunbowale still finished with 21 points, while Turner had 14 and Shepard produced her 17th double-double of the season, second-most in school history.\nThe Irish entered with the nation’s No. 1 scoring offense (89.2 points) and ranked No. 2 in field-goal percentage offense (.518). Stanford came in 18th in field-goal percentage defense (.358), but Notre Dame eventually solved the riddle.\nCalling more isolations for Young, along with high-post ball screens from the forwards, seemed to fix that.\n“Second half we went with some different sets, got some movement on the offense, played better defensively, got running and got scoring,” McGraw said.\nIn McGraw and Stanford’s Tara VanDerveer, the final Elite Eight matchup of the women",
        "baseline": "’s NCAA Tournament pitted Hall of Fame coaches with nearly 2,000 combined wins over 77 combined years on the sideline. Those totals included a combined 1,747 wins, 65 years and four national championships at their current schools.\nYoung helped extend that drought for the Pac-12 tournament champs by asserting herself at a pivotal moment. Back in November she scored a season-high 28 points on this same court in a win over DePaul.\nEven Terrence Young, six years older and a former Princeton High state champion as well, could find little fault with his sister’s performance after this one.\nWhat did he tell her after Monday’s win?\nAlong the way, Notre Dame’s starting five became the first group in Division 1 history, men’s or women’s, to cross the 10,000-point threshold for a career. That includes 1,112 points from Shepard’s first two seasons before transferring from Nebraska.",

        "prompt": "A new agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Buffalo Sewer Authority will keep billions of gallons of raw sewage from flowing directly into the Niagara River.\nIt is disconcerting that 42 years after Congress passed the Clean Water Act, 1.75 billion gallons of untreated water from storm and sanitary sewers dumps into the Niagara River every year.\nThat this problem has persisted for so long is a scandal, one that finally forced the EPA to order remedial action. The agreement announced last week will reduce the overflows by more than 70 percent, a huge decrease but still a disgusting amount of pollution. The authority will invest $380 million in infrastructure improvements to the city’s sewage system over 20 years.\nBuffalo Niagara Riverkeeper deserves huge credit for focusing public attention on the issue and pushing the EPA and Sewer Authority to work on an agreement.\nBuffalo, like many older cities, has a combined sewer system. That means human waste and stormwater runoff end up going to the same water treatment facilities. When the system is overwhelmed by runoff during heavy rain, untreated sewage is dumped directly into local waters to prevent damage to the treatment plant.\nThe agreement attacks the problem in two ways. Much of the spending will be to improve the sewage infrastructure to improve capacity.\nBut about a quarter of the money – $93 million – will go to so-called green infrastructure, projects designed to keep stormwater from reaching treatment plants in the first place.\nThose efforts stress absorbing stormwater before it enters the sewer system and include rain gardens, green roofs, restored wetlands, permeable pavements and rain barrels. To its credit, the Sewer Authority has already started working on some of these projects.\nImprovements to traditional sewage infrastructure include $41 million in upgrades at the Bird Island treatment plant, $18 million for construction of a control facility at the Hamburg drain to prevent “large floating debris” from entering the river and an $8 million storage facility at Smith Street designed to cut overflows of raw sewage. The",

That we would jeopardize that effort by dumping sewage into the Niagara River is almost beyond comprehension. Beyond the smell – and some days that’s not easy to do – just the thought of the sewage, even heavily diluted, in the river has to affect the ability to enjoy the water.\nThe agreement will improve water quality and, if the efforts to clean up the watershed continue, there may come a day when anglers will be able to safely consume the fish they take from the river.\nOur waterfront is a precious resource that was abused for too long. A cleaner Niagara River will be an even stronger magnet for the region.",

        "baseline": ", said: “A cross-party inquiry will only reveal what we as senior leaders have been saying for some time and that the funding formula is not fair by any definition and is underfunded.\n“The Worth Less? campaign has been able to provide a strong platform and voice for us as headteachers and something needs to be actioned asap by government to address the shortfall in school budgets.\nMr Loughton and the other West Sussex MPs met education secretary Damian Hinds last week to discuss the funding problems faced by the county’s schools.\nHe said: “Whilst welcoming progress so far we made it very clear to the education secretary last week that we still need to go a lot further.\n“Last summer I invited all local heads to a roundtable and asked them to provide specific examples of funding pressures on their own schools rather than national circular letters going round.\n“This gives me the best ammunition when lobbying for better funding.",

        "prompt": "Taking vacation isn’t just a stress buster. Using paid time off boosts the economy as well.\nHere’s a sad reality: U.S. workers earned an average of 21.9 vacation days last year, up a full day from 2014. Yet despite accruing more paid time off, more than half (55%) left their time on the table, according to Project: Time Off’s new report, The State of American Vacation.\nResearchers polled 5,600 working adults about their vacation habits and discovered that in total, the number of days wasted in 2015 was 658 million. That’s a full week less that workers were accustomed to taking 15 years ago. For those whose unused vacation days don’t roll over into the next year, a whopping 222 million days were lost.\nVacation usage fell below that long-term average, setting off a steady decline that has stubbornly continued ever since. While there have been occasional time-off upticks since then, they later proved to be anomalies rather than a reversal of the inexorable, downward trend.\nIn a surprising twist, the reluctance to take paid time off doesn’t correspond to economic trends or consumer confidence. In analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data on vacation usage and unemployment, the report shows that in years with the highest number of people out of work (1982 and 2010), Americans were still taking advantage of vacation.\nIn 1982, workers used an average of 20.9 vacation days a year, and in 2010, when unemployment reached 9.6%, Americans took an average of 17.6 days off a year. By contrast, in 2015, the percentage of people without jobs reduced to 5.3%, yet the vacation time taken shrunk to an average of 16.2 days a year.\nBeyond that, they estimate that those days had the potential to inject $223 billion to the U.S. economy.\nThey break it down this way: Handling the demand created by people taking those days off would require creating 1.6 million more jobs. This, in turn, results in additional income for those workers of $65 billion. The researchers estimate that even using one more day would add $34 billion in spending to our economy.\nPolling respondents reveal that workers with the best intentions don’t make good on their desire to take vacation. Comparing last year’s responses about workers’ intent to use their time off didn’t square with the reality. The researchers found that if American workers made good on their intentions to take vacation, it could have boosted the economy by $64.5 billion.\nThe reason we are becoming a nation of workaholics isn’t just due to 24/7 connectivity, courtesy of our mobile devices. According to a recent survey of nearly 9,700 full-time workers, EY, the global assurance, tax, transaction, and advisory services firm, found that one-third of employees report that managing their personal and professional lives has become more difficult. Those surveyed reported working more hours in the last five years, especially as they increased responsibilities at work (moving into management) and at home (caring for family).\nEven using one more day would add $34 billion in spending to our economy.\nThis squares with some of the results of Project: Time Off’s report. The managers surveyed said they believed it was harder for them to take time off. Nearly half (47%) were afraid of returning to a backlog of work, as compared to 37% of employees who reported the same. It was the same for self-imposed pressure to check in when they did take time away. Forty-five percent of managers said they felt responsible for checking in, as opposed to just 24% of non-management employees.\nPart of this has to do with personal validation, according to Leslie Perlow, a professor with Harvard Business School. “The more you respond, the more people email you, and so there’s very",
        "baseline": " positive reinforcement,” she told Fast Company in a previous interview.\nOn the flip side, employees overwhelmingly believe that their workplaces don’t support taking vacation. They reported that their bosses had the biggest influence on their decision to take time off, more so than family.\nEven those companies that offer unlimited vacation have to encourage their staff to use their paid time off. Startups such as Buffer and Evernote have resorted to paying employees $1,000 if they took a vacation of at least one week.\nThe report did conclude on a positive note, as the researchers believe that vacation isn’t going to go extinct. They noted that planning a vacation in advance led to better follow-through and using more of the time available to take off. Further, planning was responsible for a mood boost. Workers who planned their vacations resulted in increased happiness across nine factors, including professional success, financial situation, and their company.\nAre you making the most of your vacation time?",

        "prompt": "BALTIMORE, Dec. 30—A jury today found Representative John Dowdy, Democrat of Tex as, guilty on all eight counts in his bribery, conspiracy and perjury trial in United States District Court here.\nThe 59 ‐ year ‐ old lawmaker, who has represented East Texas districts since 1952, was al lowed to remain free on his own recognizance pending a motion for a new trial, to be filed within seven days.\nOne of his attorneys, John W. Key Jr. of Athens, Tex., said that the verdict would be ap pealed “all the way” through higher courts if a new trial was not granted.\nThe maximum possible sen tence under the eight counts is 40 years in prison and a $40, 000 fine.\nDowdy said that, pending the legal motions, he would not resign from Congress. He could be expelled by a two‐thirds vote of the House.\nThe verdict ended 28 days of proceedings that began Nov. 8. The trial was in session three or four days most weeks and was once interrupted for five days when the Representative entered a Baltimore hospital.\nThe jury reached its decision after 14 hours of deliberation.\nDowdy was found guilty on one count of conspiring with Nathan H. Cohen, a former businessman in the Baltimore‐ Washington area, to violate the Federal law on conflicts of in terest by accepting a $25,000 bribe and one count of conspir ing to obstruct justice.\nThe third count on which he was found guilty was of caus ing the bribe money to be transported in interstate com merce, specifically from Silver Spring, Md., to the airport at Atlanta, where the Representa tive, according to the indict ment, was given the money by Myrvin C. Clark, an associate of Cohen.\nFive perjury counts covered Dowdy's denials, before a Fed eral grand jury in Baltimore March 4, 1970, of the substance of the conversation between him and Cohen on Jan. 20, 1970, at Dowdy's office Capitol Hill.\nUnkown to Dowdy, the con versation was recorded on equipment concealed in Cohen's clothing by agents of the Fed eral Bureau of Investigation. Cohen had told the then United States Attorney for Maryland, Stephen H. Sachs, of his deal ings with Dowdy and had agreed to testify against him.\nThat tape recording and three others of telephone conversa tions between Cohen and Dowdy in January, 1970, were played to the jury over the vigorous objections of defense attorneys.\nIn the recording, Cohen re ferred four times to the number 25,000, mentioning “dollars” once in that context, and to previous help given to him by the Representative in avoiding prosecution.\nDowdy, in testifying before the grand jury March 4, 1970, 24 days before his indictment, denied that $25,000 had been mentioned.\nAccording to the indictment, Cohen paid the $25,000 to Dowdy in return for the Repre sentative's help in avoiding prosecution for fraud in con nection with the activities of Cohen's Monarch Construction Company.\nMonarch, based in Silver Spring, had run afoul of Federal Housing Administration regulations concerning “split financing,” obtaining additional mortgages to cover excess costs of projects insured by the agency.\nDowdy at the time headed on investigative subcommittee of the House Committee on the District of Columbia.\nAccording to the indictment, he agreed to arrange to have Cohen called as a witness be fore that",

More than four years later, when he was again under investigation, he went to Mr. Sachs with his story of bribing Dowdy.\nHe was granted immunity from prosecution in the brib ery‐conspiracy case and for other possible offenses in re turn for his cooperation in the prosecution of Dowdy but was charged with fraud in connec tion with the Monarch matter.\nPleading guilty in Washing ton in March, 1970, he was given a suspended sentence and was placed on probation early this year.\nClark pleaded guilty to fraud and was given a suspended sentence in return for agree ing to testify against Dowdy.",

        "prompt": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- An analysis of seniors' health habits -- controlling for demographic and socio-economic factors -- reveals that those who have better health habits are much more likely to say they are in \"excellent\" or \"very good\" health. But, exercising frequently, not being obese, and visiting a dentist are the most related to reporting great health.\nMore specifically, seniors who exercise frequently are much more likely than those who do not to say they are in excellent or very good health -- 51% vs. 34%. Similarly, 46% of seniors who are not obese rate their health as excellent or very good versus 31% of those who are obese. Those who eat healthy and do not smoke are also more likely to be in excellent or very good health than those who do not -- but the differences are not as great.\nThese differences hold even when controlling for age, gender, employment, income, marital status, emotional health, and each of the other healthy behaviors. This means that not being obese and exercising frequently are more highly related to great health regardless of all of these factors.\nThe direction of the relationships between seniors' health habits and self-reported health status is not clear in this analysis. For example, it is possible that only those seniors who are already in great health are able to exercise, while those who are in worse health are not able to exercise as frequently.\nThese findings are based on more than 480,000 interviews collected as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index from Jan. 1 2011, to May 21, 2012.\nAlthough exercise might be one of the most important factors to great health in old age, Americans are not engaging in it more as they age. The percentage of Americans who report exercising for at least 30 minutes three or more days per week decreases from 59% among those aged 18 to 24 to 45% among those aged 90 and older.\nExercise, though, may become more difficult for Americans as they get older. Americans' health problems tend to increase and multiply as they age, thus likely making exercise harder.\nIn contrast to exercise, the percentage of Americans who report healthy eating skyrockets as they age, climbing from 54% of 18- to 24-year-olds who say they ate healthy all day yesterday to 91% of those aged 90 and older who say say the same.\nThe percentage saying they ate healthy yesterday climbs steadily as Americans age -- into the 60% range when they hit their 40s, the 70% range in their late 50s, and then soars into the high 80% and low 90% range as they move into their 80s and 90s.\nAmericans' likelihood of visiting a dentist does not change in the same linear fashion as they age as their exercise and eating habits do. However, after peaking at 68% in the 60 to 64 age range, dental visits start to steadily decline, dropping to a low of 56% among those aged 90 and older.\nRegardless of their health habits, older Americans are much less likely to report being in excellent or very good health than are those who are younger. Sixty percent of those aged 18 to 24 say they are in excellent or very good health, which drops significantly as Americans age, falling to a low of 35% among those aged 85 to 89. The percentage who say they are in good, fair, or poor health climbs to a high of 65% among those aged 85 to 89.\nAmericans become more likely to say they are in good, fair, or poor health than in excellent or very good health once they enter their late 50s.\nWhile good health habits alone cannot stave off the effects of aging, those who do practice good health habits give themselves an edge in old age. In particular, seniors",

The platform enables you to find previously hidden parking spaces in the CBD – for a monthly fee.\n\"Through Divvy's partnerships with major commercial property groups like DEXUS Group, GPT and Knight Frank, drivers can find and access off-street parking that is affordable and convenient for them,\" Nick Austin, CEO and founder of Divvy Parking, says.\n\"Divvy currently offers monthly bookings but is close to rolling out industry first mobile access technology that will let people book and access secure short term parking with ease through their smartphone.\"\nInfrastructure Australia has warned that congestion in Sydney could cost Australia $53 billion by 2031 and while the greater population in Australia's cities can't do without their cars, there is no point driving into the CBD unless you have somewhere to park.\n\"Those rare spaces that can be found are usually limited to one or two hours, and current daily car park rates can set you back as much as a parking fine,\" Austin says. \"Creating an improved parking solution at the destination can actually reduce congestion by up to 30 per cent.\n\"The spaces we have available on Divvy were previously under-utilised by their owners – be they commercial property owners or building managers.\n\"We have worked closely with these firms to help them get a booking and marketing platform that makes their lives incredibly easy, reduces their admin costs and improves the yield of otherwise dead assets.\"\nAnother solution might be the option of DriveMyCar, a car rental service, which Chris Noone started five years ago.\n\"DriveMyCar is not your traditional car rental company,\" Noone says. \"We are an online peer-to-peer marketplace connecting car owners looking to earn some extra money by renting out their car, with drivers who are no longer prepared to pay high car rental costs and want more choice.\n\"It is completely free for owners to list their car and free for both owners and renters to register with DriveMyCar.\"\nAccording to Noone, thousands of cars are under-utilised in Australia with 35% of Sydney households having two cars. He says that people often want to rent cars from one week onwards.\n\"Normal car insurance does not cover cars that are used for rental purposes, that's why it's risky to rent a car through Gumtree and the like,\" Noone says. \"DriveMyCar holds a motor fleet policy that covers cars for damage and theft during rental.\"\nBut he is very confident that the model will work.\n\"We have over 400 vehicles available, nearly 15,000 registered users, $4.4 million paid out to car owners through nearly 5000 bookings,\" he says. \"DriveMyCar is rapidly becoming the no fuss, go-to platform for everyday Aussies, travellers and businesses to rent cars, without being ripped off.\n\"The cost of insurance is included in the advertised listing price, not lumped on as a hidden extra and the insurance excess is lower than many traditional car rental firms.\n\"Cars are up to 62 per cent cheaper than other car rental firms because DriveMyCar doesn't own the fleet of cars available – it's tapping into the thousands of cars around Australia that aren't being used.\"\nEarlier this year Ford developed a parking app, the parking spotter, to bring to the market.\nDeveloped with Georgia Tech, the app leverages driver-",

It also reduces fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.\nBy while all these innovations are helpful, they still don't address the key issues of addressing Australia's infrastructure issues and the urgency required in fixing our transport problems.\nWith demand for public transport in the capital cities (measured by passenger kilometres travelled) set to rise by 55 per cent in Sydney, 121 per cent in Melbourne and an average of 89 per cent across all capital cities, unless peak period passenger loads are managed and capacity is increased, commuters in all capital cities will see more services experiencing \"crush loadings\", where peak demand exceeds capacity.",

When it comes to the beautiful game, this beautiful land may as well not exist for all the attention it gets.\nThe limit of the national team’s ambitions at the moment is the South Asian Football Federation Cup in September but few are confident that the Green Shirts will get their hands on the trophy in Nepal. Of the nine editions played so far, India have won six, Maldives, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have all triumphed once but Pakistan have still to even reach the final.\nPreparations are not going well. So much so, that, at the time of writing, there are not really any preparations at all.\n“We need a large number of international matches, which will give players need international experience and confidence,” Pakistan’s national team coach Zavisa Milosavljevic told Al Jazeera.\nThe Serbian is beginning to realise that it is easier said than done. A planned mini-series in June at Fulham’s Craven Cottage in London with India and Bangladesh has been cancelled. It’s a familiar refrain. In 2011, a similar event scheduled to take place in three British cities also never happened.\nThey could have been meaningful matches for UK-born Pakistani international Zesh Rehman. After all, the well-travelled defender played for Fulham in the Premier League.\nNow in Hong Kong with Kitchee, he doesn’t expect to be back in England any time soon.\n“I'm not surprised in the least that the games have been cancelled again in the UK,” Rehman told Al Jazeera.\nImproving the local league, with its poor facilities and standards, would help. Rumours of a football copy of cricket’s Indian Premier League, teams full of stars and showmen, seem fanciful though fantasy is understandable when you look at the reality.\nThe government runs the best teams such as champion Khan Research Laboratories. Such set-ups and names lack appeal for fans and private investors, two groups that are largely absent with many attendances struggling to run into three figures. Unsurprisingly, broadcasters are not that interested either.\nSecurity problems, especially in football-loving Balochistan, don’t help. Having the league squeezed into four months means that players’ fitness levels suffer and the few fans there are lose interest.\n“The league should be professional,” noted Milosavljevic.\nThe lack of foreign imports in the league is another problem according to Rehman.\nWhat Pakistan does have are players like Rehman, born overseas with European experience. Afghanistan has an increasing Diaspora that helped the team reached the final of the 2011 of the South Asian Cup. Yet in Pakistan the international stars are not always welcomed by the folks back home. Mohammad Essa, the best-home grown player of recent years has been consistent in his criticism of how the foreign stars arrive late for training camps and are not as committed as the home-grown heroes.\n\"It's normal in football to look for scapegoats to it's not a huge surprise the foreign-based players will get the blame so the local lads don't lose face. The reality is the local players are nowhere near good enough or tactically aware enough to improve the FIFA rankings significantly.\"\nIt rankles Rehman. “It’s normal in football",

Anything else is still a dream. The team fails to get anywhere near qualification for the Asian Cup, never mind the global tournament. Rehman’s evaluation is probably more optimistic than most.",

Members of the Salt Lake Astronomical Society watched intently as regions of denser material swirled, condensed and slid around, representing events inside a vast molecular cloud in space happening over a period of 250,000 years.\nA math and science teacher at Northridge High School, Layton, and an adjunct professor at Weber State University, Layton, Sumner was describing the formation of stars within what are termed giant molecular clouds. He spoke during the society’s monthly meeting, April 19 at the Engineering/Mines Classroom Building, University of Utah.\nHow rarefied are they? Sumner said the amount of air molecules between the eye of a seated person and the floor – approximately 1 cm. by 1 cm. by 1 meter (0.6 inch by 0.6 inch by 39 inches) – is equal to the number of molecules in a stretch of a GMC that is 1 cm. by 1 cm. by 25,000 light years. A good vacuum on Earth would be one-billionth as rarefied, he said.\nIn addition, the clouds are extremely cold, with many parts only 10 Kelvin (which is minus 441.4 degrees F). Yet they glow and some are visible to backyard telescopes.\n“Why is it so luminous? Because it’s humongous,” he said. The brightness of an object depends on this formula: luminosity equals the energy emitted per square yard times the overall area. An object that puts out only a little light per square mile can appear bright through a telescope if the object covers enough square miles.\n“For reasons that we really don’t understand very well, sometimes certain regions within this giant molecular cloud will start to gravitationally attract” material. These regions, called cores, form where parts of a GMC are dense enough. They continue to accumulate swirling gas and dust, becoming yet denser as their gravity pulls in more material.\nBut what causes the gas to become dense enough to form cores in the first place? “In fact, this is an area of much research and disagreement right now,” Sumner said. The main candidate for triggering such chances in the cloud is turbulence, he said. Turbulence could arise from shockwaves from nearby supernovas or pressure changes from stars in the region. The GMC’s gas is chaotic, so its actions are hard to understand. “We’re not very good at predicting weather yet,” let alone such exotic phenomena.\nGalaxy collisions are known to create stars in GMCs.\n“When galaxies collide, stars never hit because they’re separated by light years. But these giant molecular clouds do.” When molecular clouds in Galaxy A rip through those of Galaxy B, the collisions can trigger a round of star formation. Density waves that move within spiral galaxies are another cause of turbulence.\nSumner said temperature, pressure, and angular momentum slow down the star’s formation. In the end, gravity wins over forces like these that otherwise would blow away material. When enough matter has accumulated in the core, gravity makes it suddenly collapse into a protostar.\nA remnant of the",
        "baseline": " larger core surrounds the protostar, and as the protostar continues to gather material and shrink, it becomes hotter. “These protostars collapse from the inside out …. The stuff at the center collapse first and then the stuff at the top collapses on top,” he said.\nAs this is going on, gravity increases, the protostar becomes denser, and the collapse speeds up. The protostar heats to the point that its hydrogen molecules begin to fuse into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy, and a star shines out of the dust.\nThe dusty disk around the newborn star may clump together and form planets. Eventually the star’s solar wind blows much of the surrounding material away.\nAt talk’s end he again projected the video with its swirling gas and material moving toward and away from denser parts. Look at the chaotic action, Sumner said, “and then contemplate how we all came to be here.",

        "prompt": "DETROIT — The federal government has planted a bulls-eye on another senior UAW official, charging him with buying designer clothes, luggage and golf equipment with money that was supposed to help train rank-and-file autoworkers.\nKeith Mickens, a top labor leader who helped negotiate contracts between the UAW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, is the fifth person charged in the growing scandal in which prosecutors allege that FCA executives and union officials schemed together to enrich themselves. To date, two FCA officials, two labor leaders and the wife of a UAW official have been charged, and more indictments are in the pipeline.\nAccording to a document unsealed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Mickens was part of a years-long bribery scheme that cheated tens of thousands of Fiat Chrysler autoworkers out of $4.5 million in training funds.\nThe alleged scheme worked like this: An FCA executive and others siphoned the money from the fund, and then funneled it to themselves and union officials through phony charities. FCA officials also gave UAW officials credit cards that were funded by the training center and encouraged them to pamper themselves with the cards.\nAnd they did, prosecutors allege.\nMickens, according to charging document, used his National Training Center credit card in 2013 to buy more than $1,000 worth of luggage from a Detroit store. Between 2012 and 2014, he racked up $6,500 in charges on the credit card, buying items including electronics, designer clothing and golf equipment for himself and for other UAW officials.\nAn attorney for Mickens was not readily available for comment.\nAlso charged in the scheme are Monica Morgan, 54, of Harrison Township, Mich., the widow of the late UAW Vice President General Holiefield. The government said Morgan and Holiefield both stole from the training center with the help of FCA Vice President Alphons Iacobelli, who was also charged in the scheme and has pleaded guilty in the case.\nAccording to prosecutors, Iacobelli helped raid $4.5 million from the UAW-Chrysler National Training Center and spending it on himself and UAW officials, buying everything from luxury vehicles to $35,000 Mont Blanc ink pens.\nMorgan also pleaded guilty in the case last month, but only to a tax crime, admitting she hid $201,000 from the government on her 2011 taxes, but without explaining where the money came from.\nShe faces 27 months in prison under her sentencing guidelines. She will be sentenced June 4 and also has to pay $190,747 in restitution to the U.S. Treasury.\nAccording to prosecutors, Morgan's photo business once received $70,000 from a charity that was supposed to help children struggling with hardships. The government claims the charity was really a sham, set up by Holiefield and Iacobelli, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy",
        "baseline": " and tax evasion last month. Iacobelli faces up to eight years in prison.\nDuring the scheme, the government says, Holiefield was the director of the UAW Chrysler Department and acted as the lead negotiator and the lead administrator for the collective bargaining agreements between the UAW and FCA. He died in 2015.\nAccording to court documents, the UAW-Chrysler National Training Center was funded by FCA and received between $13 million and $31 million a year. Prosecutors say at least $4.5 million of that money was misspent, and allege that FCA executives were bribing union brass with the intention of giving the company a better position at the bargaining table.\nThe UAW has stressed that the scheme did not affect negotiations.\nJerome Durden of Rochester Hills, Mich., a financial analyst at FCA who allegedly helped conceal the fraud by cooking the books.

        "prompt": "The original Horace Staples High School on Riverside Avenue, dating to 1884.\nLast Thursday was Horace Staples’ birthday. If he were still alive, he would be 218 years old.\nHe didn’t make it that far, of course. But he led a long and fruitful life nonetheless. When Horace Staples died of pneumonia on March 6, 1897, he was 96. He had outlived his wives and children. He was the oldest and best-known citizen in town.\nMore than a decade earlier, he had established Westport’s high school. His name and legacy live on, 135 years later.\nBut as Staples High School celebrated Founder’s Day last week — with exhibits, speakers and “Horace Staples” (yours truly, dressed in long coat and top hat) roaming the halls — it was a good time to ask: Who was that guy?\nQuite an interesting character, it turns out.\nHorace was a direct descendant of Thomas Staples, one of five settlers who founded Fairfield in 1639. Another ancestor — Mary Staples — was acquitted of witchcraft during the fever of 1692.\nHorace Staples began working at age 8. At 27, he started a lumber and hardware business in Saugatuck. It soon grew into a general store carrying grain, groceries, household furnishings and medicines. He bought sailing vessels, a silk factory and an axe factory. He owned a thriving pier off the west bank of the Saugatuck River, near the State Street (now Post Road) bridge. In 1852 he helped establish a bank. Somehow, he found time to run a farm.\nDuring the Civil War, Staples watched in dismay as Westport boys and girls boarded the State Street trolley. Some headed west to Norwalk, others east to Bridgeport — the nearest towns with high schools. It was time, he thought, for his village to “get up” a high school of its own.\nHe offered to give Westport a lot for a building, but no one did anything. He offered again, but again the town failed to act. Year after year, young Westporters went elsewhere for their education. Others, at age 14, began to work.\nIn 1880 Staples’ only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, died. His sole remaining heir was a grandson, William Gray Staples. Horace decided the fortune he intended to leave his daughter should benefit all young people in town. Nearly 80 years old — and so hard of hearing he carried a yard-long ear trumpet — Horace Staples embarked on a final project that, more than a century later, dwarfs every other endeavor of his long, successful life.\nHe was no stranger to education. In his 20s, he had worked as a schoolteacher. In 1781 his grandfather’s cousin, Samuel Staples, established the Staples Free School in Easton (it is now the Samuel Staples School).\nIn 1882 Horace redrew his will, directing some of his money toward construction of a building. He began planning a red brick building just up the road from his West (now Riverside) Avenue colonial home (it still stands, near Da Pietro restaurant).\nThe school would be on the “horse railroad” line, between the population centers of Westport and Saugatuck. Students could ride the horse cars for three cents a ride (the regular fare was eight cents). Though over 80 years old he was in good health, and came from a long line of long-living people. “I might as well see my name in bricks while I am still alive,” he said.\nAfter the building was constructed, Staples’ bequest said, the balance of the funds would be invested in “a perpetual fund” to ensure continued education for both sexes.\nA ceremony was held on April 22, 1884. At 1 p.m. whistles and sirens blew, church bells rang. Businesses closed. Westporters of all ages poured across the bridge. A procession formed in front of National Hall (where Horace Staples’ owned his bank), turned left and made the short walk to the ceremony, where",
        "baseline": " 2,500 people gathered. Westporters today know it as the site of Saugatuck Elementary School. That’s not the original building, though — it was torn down in 1967.\nGov. Thomas Waller arrived. Pastors offered prayers. A choir sang a hymn composed specially for the occasion, by Agnes Lewis. Then came the highlight: the laying of the cornerstone.\nThe Rev. Alonzo Lewis — assisted by “a colored workman” from Easton — spread cement. More prayers were said. Horace Staples’ great-grandson, Master Horace Staples — was introduced.

Simpson custody of his children has failed.\nOrganizers gathering signatures for the recall of Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock fell \"just short\" of the minimum needed by Wednesday to put the issue on a special election ballot, organizer Tammy Bruce said.\nThe Los Angeles-based Women's Progressive Alliance initiated the recall effort in April after Stock awarded custody to Simpson, who had been acquitted of murdering the children's mother. The group also was enraged by a case in which a mother to whom Stock had awarded joint custody of two children later killed them, her boyfriend and herself.\nStock and her supporters steadfastly maintained that both decisions were within the law and that the recall effort undermined the independence of the judiciary.\nStock could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But Judi Curtin, president of the family law section of the Orange County Bar Assn. and an opponent of the recall, expressed satisfaction at the outcome.\n\"I would say that the failed recall effort reinforces and restores my faith in the legal and judicial system,\" she said. \"I think it says an inordinate amount about Judge Stock and her character, and that the average voter supports her.

In recent years an increasing number of these have been child refugees from Muslim-majority countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, many arriving here traumatised and in need of care.\nThose featured here were nervous that their stories would be misreported, an issue highlighted recently in the story about a white Christian girl supposedly “forced into Muslim foster care”. The story was cited as emblematic of a greater clash between Islam and Christianity. It has also provoked fears that the media storm could deter Muslims from fostering at a time when the need for a more diverse pool of carers has never been greater.\nJust before Christmas seven years ago, Riffat and Sajjad were at home when the phone rang. It was the foster agency letting them know that three children they’d never met would be arriving shortly. The children – two sisters and a brother – were in urgent need of short-term care. Sajjad and Riffat had been approved as foster carers only two months earlier and these would be their first placements.\n“We were excited, but I was also a bit nervous,” recalls Sajjad, 50. The couple had tried to start a family after they married, but fertility problems led to six failed cycles of IVF. They considered adopting, but eventually decided to sign up as foster carers.\nBoth are observant Muslims of Pakistani heritage. Riffat, 46, was wearing a headscarf when we met, and prays five times a day. How did they cope with the arrival of three white English children raised in a Christian household?\n“I will never forget that day,” recalls Riffat, who grew up in Pakistan and moved to Britain after marrying in 1997. “It really was like being thrown in the deep end.” They bought chicken and chips from the local takeaway for the children and the support worker told the couple about the children’s bedtime routine.\nOnce the children were asleep, Sajjad headed out on an urgent shopping mission. “We are Muslims and we’d never had a Christmas tree in our home,” says Riffat. “But these children were Christian and we wanted them to feel connected to their culture.” So he bought a Christmas tree, decorations and presents. The couple worked until the early hours putting the tree up and wrapping presents. The first thing the children saw the next morning was the tree.\n“I had never seen that kind of extra happiness and excitement on a child’s face,” remembers Riffat. The children were meant to stay for two weeks – seven years later two of the three siblings are still living with them.\nThe girls, 15 and 12, have also introduced Riffat and Sajjad to the world of after-school ballet, theatre classes and going to pop concerts. “I wouldn’t see many Asian parents at those places,” she says. “But I now tell my extended family you should involve your children in these activities because it is good for their confidence.” Having the girls in her life has also made Riffat reflect on her own childhood. “I had never spent even an hour outside my home without my siblings or parents until my wedding day,” she says.\nJust as Riffat and Sajjad have learned about Christianity, the girls have come to look forward to Eid and the traditions of henna. “I’ve taught them how to make potato curry, pakoras and samosas,” Riffat says. “But their spice levels are not quite the same as ours yet.” The girls can also sing Bollywood songs and speak Urdu.\nA British Pakistani, Shareen (and her husband Asif, 47), began fostering three years ago after three failed rounds of IVF. She has looked after children from many nationalities including Afro-Caribbean, Syrian, Egyptian and Pakistani.\nThe key to coping, she says, was to try to understand the reasons behind the challenging behaviour. “You have to look at the person’s history,” she says. “No child is born to take drugs or join a gang. It has happened because nobody has cared for them.” The boy ended up staying with Shareen for eight months.\nShareen’s longest foster placement arrived three years ago: a boy from Syria. “He was 14 and had hidden inside a lorry all the way from Syria,” she says. The boy was deeply traumatised. They had to communicate via Google Translate; Shareen later learned Arabic and he picked up English within six months. She read up on Syria and the political situation there to get an insight into the conditions he had left.\nHomayun, 51,",

But nature is merciless when it comes to wiping out inefficient life forms.\"\nProfessor Kaku advocates 'terraforming', the process of creating a habitable environment on another planet.\nHe believes this could be achieved on Mars by launching solar satellites to the planet, to beam sunlight onto its polar ice caps to begin the process of heating it.\n\"Once you can raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, it takes off all by itself. All of a sudden you get a runaway greenhouse effect, and Mars basically terraforms itself,\" he says.\nBut he says he's not suggesting humans need to evacuate Earth.\n\"No-one is talking about leaving the Earth and going to Mars,\" Professor Kaku says.\n\"We're talking about a settlement, a self-sustaining settlement on Mars, that's not going to drain the resources of the planet Earth but will give us an insurance policy, a plan B.\"\nWould you go to Mars if it meant never returning? For this woman, the answer is 'yes'.\nTo put something — or someone — on Mars costs upwards of $1 million per half-kilogram.\nThat's prohibitive — but Professor Kaku doesn't expect it to stay that way forever.\nHe uses the example of The Martian, a film starring Matt Damon. It cost $100 million to make, while the Indian Government sent a probe to Mars for $70 million.\n\"So a Hollywood movie about going to Mars cost more than actually going to Mars,\" he says.\nAnd, he says, \"prices are dropping like a rock\".\nProfessor Kaku believes we may one day even gain the capacity to travel through space without even leaving home.\n'Laser porting', as he calls it, involves a person's memories and thoughts being digitised in an AI-driven replica. That digital self is then transmitted via laser beam into space.\n\"In one second you are on the Moon. In 20 minutes you're on Mars and in a few hours you are on Jupiter,\" he says.\n\"One day someone in Silicon Valley will digitise everything known about Einstein and put it into a robot with a personality and we will be able to talk to Albert Einstein.\n\"We'll talk to Winston Churchill.\n\"Libraries will be a library of souls.\"\nProfessor Kaku believes laser porting could become a reality for humans within 50 or 100 years — though he argues others might have beaten us to it.\n\"I'll stick my neck out, I think this already exists,\" he says.\n\"I think aliens from outer space ... simply digitise their personality, put it on a laser beam and shoot their consciousness at the speed of light.\"\nProfessor Kaku says the possibility of space tourism and colonisation has created major regulatory gaps that need to be addressed now.\n\"We need a new outer space treaty to regulate traffic as we go into outer space, and we have to regulate private enterprise,\" he says.\nThe Outer Space Treaty of 1967 determines that nuclear weapons shouldn't be put into space and nation states cannot claim Mars or the Moon.\nBut Professor Kaku says it's not enough",
        "baseline": ".\n\"The problem is, in 1969, who would have thought that a private individual using his own piggy bank, using his own bank account, can create a Moon rocket fully capable of reaching the Moon with colonists?\n\"Elon Musk is selling tickets — tickets to be on the first commercial venture to the Moon, and a Japanese billionaire by the name of [Yusaku] Maezawa bought out the entire rocket.\n\"So this is now well within economic feasibility to have tourists go to the Moon.\"\nThere are growing — and competing — interests at stake, he says: China is vying to go to the Moon, Japan and India have already sent missions there, and even Google wants to mine asteroids.\n\"We need new regulations, just like we needed regulations in California when the Gold Rush happened there and we had thousands of miners clashing with each other to hunt for gold,\" Professor Kaku says.\n\"We are not the only game in town anymore.\"",

        "prompt": "Testing women to see if they are cured of the virus that can cause cervical cancer following treatment for abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix is more effective and cheaper than cervical screening alone, according to research led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\nIn England, cervical screening through cytology is recommended every three years for women aged 25-49 and every five years for women aged 50-65 years.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia or CIN are pre-cancerous lesions on the surface of the cervix that can develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. After treatment for high grade CIN, guidelines in the UK previously recommended annual cytology for at least 10 years. After low grade CIN, cytology is recommended at six, 12 and 24 months, and if all results are negative then women can resume routine screening.\nPrevious studies were inconsistent about whether or not testing for the human papillomavirus (HPV) as “test of cure” was more effective or cost-effective than cytology testing alone.\nAnalysing data (comprising 416 women) from six sites across England that returned women to routine screening after a single negative HPV test result at six months, they found that that follow-up after treatment for CIN by cytology only resulted in 29 reoccurring cases of CIN stage 3 per 1,000 women over 10 years. The HPV ‘test for cure’ averted around eight additional cases over this time. The cytology only follow-up estimated cost is £358,222 per 1,000 women with HPV ‘test of cure’ costing £348,834, saving approximately £9,388 per 1000 women treated.\n",
        "baseline": "According to the authors, early use of HPV testing after treatment averts more cases of CIN stage 3 and is cost-saving because it is more effective at early detection of women who are at risk of recurrent disease in future. They add that HPV testing results in fewer colposcopies (a detailed examination of the cervix) over 10 years than cytology only follow-up, and a higher proportion of colposcopies resulted in re-treatment – an important reduction in the burden of follow-up on women, and also on the health system.\nDr Rosa Legood, Lecturer in Decision Modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who led the research in collaboration with modellers in Australia, said: “The key finding from our research is that human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is likely to be more effective and cost less than strategies based on annual cytological follow-up of women treated for pre-cancer lesions.",

        "prompt": "Apple iPhone 7 - Blacklisted? Network Lock? Huh?\nBought an iPhone 7 Plus from a mutual friend, someone who I trust(ed) to not sell me stolen goods. Phone came all neat in the box, all accessories there, serial checked out fine and there’s no issues with iCloud. He even showed me the proof of purchase slip (1 yr old phone, for the record).\nMy first thought was network lock. Went to Telkom and they claim no network lock (apparently hasn’t been a thing since iPhone 5). Went to MTN and Vodacom and they claim there is no blacklisting evident for my IMEI on their systems.\nMy first question is how do I verify for certain whether there is an IMEI blacklisting in place?\nSecond question is if there is blacklisting on this phone and there is no valid reason for it being blacklisted (i.e. I can show proof of purchase, etc), is there any legitimate way to remove the blacklisting?\nAny useful advice or experience with this sort of issue would be appreciated!\niPhones have never been network locked.\nAll I can think is that this is not a \"Global\" phone and just GSM and is therefore frequency restricted and doesn't work MTN and Vodacom due to their spectrum usage.\nBlacklisting should apply across all of them so I doubt it's that.\nCheck which model it is here and that should lead you down the path to enlightenment. Chances are your friend wasn't even aware this is the case.\nHOWEVER if it's a locally sourced phone then it should have been a Global phone as far as I know.\nThe box (for what it’s worth) has the ICASA badge on it. On inspection (on the phone, in the About and on the box), it is the model A1785*, which as you surmised is the Global phone and only has compatibility issues with some US carriers.\nThis is my understanding too... is there maybe a delay in the propagation of IMEI blacklisting across the different networks?\nMaybe it's worth trying the 2G/3G/LTE settings to see if that makes any difference but that should really only apply to mobile data and I would expect it to still register for voice otherwise.\nThe box (for what it’s worth) has the ICASA badge on it. On inspection (on the phone, in the About and on the box), it is the model A1785, which as you surmised is the Global phone and only has compatibility issues with some US carriers.\nHmm well if it's Global then that's no issue for sure.\nAre these MTN/Vodacom sims cut by any chance or are they original nano sims?\nAlso you can't remove a blacklisting the network says isn't there. Either which way you'll be running into a human problem.\nI had an iphone 6s I bought on gumtree and had the same issue,phone would work only on Vodacom and get no service with the other networks. The phone had been originally from Vodacom and they claimed phone wasn't blacklisted so as the other networks. The problem was never fixed.\nNope, not cut - original SIM’s that work in my iPhone SE and a Samsung S7 Edge.\nThe instant you put in a Telkom or Cell C SIM it registers on the network and just works as it should. MTN and Vodacom it states “Searching” for about 10 secs and then “No Service”.\nThe problem was never fixed.\nWell I hope I’m not in the same boat (though I have a feeling I am), else this thing is off to my SO in the UK where it can get some use!\nJust go buy 2 new prepaid sims for the ones that say No Carrier and try them to see if you get signal. Could be an issue with the sim cards you've got.\nThere has never been an issue with spectrum for MTN and Vodacom. The US phones are actually better since they can use CDMA if you really need to. The only issues originally were Telkom and Cell C with their LTE bands (TDD and some weird frequency), but that hasn't been a problem for the last couple of years.\nThe A1785 is the Japanese model version - you may want to check the frequency band support vs the bands used in SA by the providers you’re having issues with.\nWhen you search for available networks (with Telkom or Cell C SIMs), do they show the other networks as existing?\nYou should check the IMEI. I was sold a Vodafone modem that had no IMEI and wouldn't register on their network. I don't know if Telkom or Cell C would register it but the format could be invalid and register on one network but not the other. Also check your network settings and if it's locked to a specific network(s).\nEDIT: I think I actually used that modem on Cell C first and it wasn't working.\nWhen I went to Vodacom and MTN shops, they did this for me with a few different working SIM cards.\nYes it does show all of the networks when I try to manually configure carrier (Vodacom, MTN, Cell C and Telkom).\nIMEI checked with iStore Tygervalley yesterday and no issues found. In fact they noted it is Vodacom stock and still under warranty for a month!\nThe most frustrating part about issues like this is finding someone at one of these networks/carriers who knows how the f*%# any of this works!!\nSo many opinions have been thrown at me by Voda/MTN/Cell C store employees about how it’s a SIM issue, then it’s an Apple issue and there must be a problem",
        "baseline": " with the Serial number, then it’s definitely blacklisted, then it’s definitely not blacklisted.\nAnother guy at the Datastore chipped in that blacklisting of stolen devices in SA is often not across all networks, that the blacklisting system doesn’t work well and often only the networks that the original owner was using and that they called to report and blacklist the device after it was stolen will have it blacklisted. Does anyone have experience or knowledge about this?\nJust take it to vodacom and tell them to fix it.\nThe \"not the original owner\" thing is nonsense. They wouldn't even be able to tell the original owner unless it was bought on contract from them.\nOut of a matter of interest does the IMEI match the invoice and the box?\nIt does sound weird that Vodacom would sell a Japanese model here. Maybe the phone was damaged and the repair shop used a second hand shell.",

        "prompt": "Way to go, Clarendon Hills. A charming French bistro with dynamite pâtés and onion soup gratinée just put you on the map; Rogers Park rolls out the welcome mat for a Viet/French combo.\nTo claim bragging rights these days, a suburb needs a fine French bistro. West suburban Clarendon Hills joined that club in June when Nadia Tilkian opened Maijean just south of its lovely downtown Metra station. The young chef/owner, who earned her stripes at Bistro 110, Zinfandel, and Barrington Country Bistro, has unleashed a bistro guaranteed to boost community pride. Family pride, too. “‘Maijean’ is what Tilkian used to call her grandmother,” explained one server, “and the charming drawing at the bottom of the menu depicts her.” But on one visit, when the chef strolled by our table, she indicated that her mother, a “great cook,” was at least an equal inspiration. Maybe it’s genetic.\nTilkian quickly seduced me with her generous plate of delicious pâtés—chicken liver, pork rillettes, and pheasant—from the lengthy specials menu. The escargots baked with herbs and garlic blanketed under a golden tender crust and the crisp veal sweetbreads with cornichon-apple relish and caper jus had exactly the same effect. The inevitable French onion soup gratinée should win over even the pickiest bistro traditionalist.\nThe chef handles salmon, baby bok choy, and haricots verts en papillote with a deft hand and an Asian touch. After our server cut open the parchment, he poured a little pitcher of delicate ginger beurre blanc over the still-steaming fish and vegetables. Aromatherapy at its best. Seared duck breast with Calvados sauce and an apple-shallot Tatin also showed skill, as did the hearty braised beef short ribs with mashed potatoes and shredded Brussels sprouts slaw. One time a thick slab of calf’s liver with bacon-sherry sauce arrived a little overcooked and dry. But on another visit, when I requested the liver lightly cooked, it came up a juicy winner, served with smashed potatoes topped with fried onions (one last quibble: I prefer the onions directly on the liver). As if to dispel the white-wine-with-fish, red-wine-with-meat fable for all time, the well-balanced 2004 Bernard Moray Santenay Burgundy ($52) enhanced each of these entrées.\nKudos to the peaches poached in Champagne with anise angel food cake and lemongrass ice cream as well as the Granny Smith apple tart with raisins and Danish blue cheese ice cream. Maijean is a comfortable art nouveau setting, with well-spaced tables, a big vintage wood bar, and a high ceiling. And bonus points galore for a conversation-friendly room and polished service as well as food.\nThe first time I walked through the doors of Viet Bistro, I thought MapQuest had failed me. I found myself in a big lounge abuzz with happy thirty, maybe fortysomethings, busy with each other and colorful cocktails. I plowed through the bar area and found the inviting dining room decked with raw brick walls, big orange-upholstered banquettes, and tables with white paper over white cloths set with dark chopsticks and votive candles. It didn’t look Vietnamese. Nor did it look French, as the name would imply. I feared yet another shaky East-West fusion incursion cloaked in a modern setting.\nBut the Nguyen family, the people behind Viet Bistro, know what they’re doing. They used to own Pasteur—long the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chicago—and they put Pasteur’s chef, Daniel Nguyen, in VB’s kitchen. Let’s also recall the long history of the French in Vietnam. In France, Vietnamese restaurants abound. The cuisine is delicate, complex, and refined, employing Chinese cooking techniques with a distinctive palette of flavors and touches of French finesse. Southern Vietnamese cooking also incorporates some of the spices of India. But except for grizzled Vietnam vets and diehard foodies, Americans barely know the cuisine. Too bad. Lighter than the more familiar Chinese, it uses far less oil; I think of it as the spa cuisine of Asian cookery.\nApparently so does the chef. I admire the well-defined flavors of Nguyen’s sauces, beginning with the sweet spicy one he makes for nem, glazed ground chicken and pork meatballs wrapped around lemongrass stalks. A lovely warm salad of shrimp, baby squid, and sliced scallops with cellophane noodles, cucumber, mint, and lime leaves sparkles in tamarind-lime vinaigrette. I could survive on a diet of Nguyen’s pho, the classic Vietnamese beef soup. For a variation on the theme, try hu tie saté, beef noodle soup with zippy garlic-onion sauce. Or, if you want more spice in your life, order the fine shrimp curry soup. No Vietnamese meal would seem complete without dainty spring rolls, and the ones here, made with shrimp, rice noodles, and assorted greens in rice paper wraps do the trick, especially with a run through VB’s complex peanut dipping sauce.\nConservative palates should enjoy the bo lui entrée, more on the French side than the Vietnamese: impossibly tender beef tenderloin cubes marinated in pinot noir, soy sauce, and peppercorns with fresh watercress and other vegetables. For meat with more oomph, look to beef curry (made with filet mignon) served sliced and stir-fried in spicy curry sauce, another nod to the Indian influence in parts of Vietnam. I wasn’t so fond of the stir-fried chicken, bland despite being seasoned with lemongrass and jalapeños. Far better was the tofu fried in curry sauce with vegetables—an inexpensive ($10) vegetarian choice. And Nguyen got my full attention with seafood creations such as stir-fried shrimp in spicy garlic-onion sauce with red and green bell peppers and a beautiful whole red snapper in sweet garlic chili sauce. Both went swimmingly with a dry 2004 Rebenhof Kabinett German riesling ($33).\nFrom the party-hearty lounge drink list, a cantaloupe martini made with fruit sorbet got things off to a bracing start.

        "prompt": "A team of Israeli scientists has discovered a very innovative way to detect people suffering from anxiety disorders: a simple and inexpensive blood test which should be available next year.\nAccording to IsraCast, a team of Israeli scientists has discovered a very innovative way to detect people suffering from anxiety disorders but who appear to be healthy. A simple blood test will reveal if you're unable to handle stress and if you need a medical treatment without the need for any psychological advise. Such a simple test would be particularly helpful for soldiers returning from war zones or for people having being subjected to severe stress, such as after terrorist attacks or natural disasters. This blood test should be available next year. But the researchers are already working on another diagnosis tool, this one for depression.\nThis blood test is based on research done by Hermona Soreq and her colleagues at the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.\nHere is a brief background about the chemical reactions behind the phenomenon of anxiety disorder.\nAcetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. [...] Over the years studies have shown that when the body feels stress (for example when a child jumps in front of your car) the level of ACh in the synapses rises. In order for the body to return to normal levels of ACh a special enzyme called Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which breaks down the ACh, springs into action.\nNormally the levels of ACh and AchE decrease after the cause of the stress disappears, but people suffering from anxiety disorders continue to maintain high levels of ACh and AChE. [...] Previous studies on mice suggested that two other enzymes called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and paraoxonase (PON) are also involved in the anxiety controlling mechanism.\nThen Soreq and her team got the idea of checking if people showing abnormal levels of AChE, BChE and PON would also exhibit anxiety symptoms by accessing a U.S. database of 461 individuals. When they found a correlation of 90% between these two kinds of events, the idea of a blood test was born.\nAs an example of the technology currently used in Soreq's lab, below is a picture of \"the SPECTRAFluor machine in the Hebrew university is used to measure the level of AChE enzyme in the blood serum\" (Credit for image and caption: IsraCast).\nSo when such a test will be available?\nAccording to Soreq the blood test will be inexpensive, accurate and will take only a few hours to receive the results. Currently the blood test is not yet available, [but] if all goes according to plan, [it should] be available on the market in less than a year.\nObviously, not everyone agrees with the fact that this blood test will be inexpensive and accurate. For example, here is what you can read on the World of Psychology blog.\n1. Not something scientifically-accepted yet.\n2. Is not less expensive.\n3. Is not more accurate.\n4. Does not take less time.\n5. Involves more professionals, a needle and blood draw, and likely more inconvenience for the client/patient in most circumstances.\nThe author says that this research work was not mentioned in peer-reviewed scientific publications. In fact, this is not true. Some of this research work has been published by the Processings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) under the name \"Acetylcholinesterase/paraoxonase genotype and expression predict anxiety scores in Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training, and Genetics study\" (Vol. 101, No. 15, Pages 5512–5517, April 13, 2004). Here are two links to the abstract and the full paper (PDF format, 6 pages, 455 KB).\nAnd, even if it doesn't guarantee that the",

But instead of being slightly less hostile to reporters, Clinton would do better to smother them – with attention if not love. She should take a week or two and let reporters hang around her for as long as they dare. Conversation should follow a single ground rule: only public policy questions allowed. It needn’t all be on-the-record: The goal is to achieve an ecstatic boredom, with sporadic instances of genuine human interaction, as Clinton diligently grinds reporters into a substantive stupor.\nClinton might hate the self-exposure.

This could be a very significant advantage. Her policies will almost certainly be more popular than those of her eventual Republican opponent.\nClinton would survive the intrusion and annoyance. And when you consider what Republican candidates endure a week or two in the steady company of the press seems positively dignified. Reporters would never be fully satisfied with a ban on questions about the family foundation or outside income. But the rapprochement would pay dividends in deeper, broader coverage of policy.

        "prompt": "Saving for a deposit is the worst, so here are some tips to help make extra cash. Because we can't all be famous vloggers.\n1. Get paid to shop.\nMystery shopping is a magical thing where you get paid to shop and dine out. It's a fully regulated industry, and to do well, you need to have a sharp eye and memory. You're sent out to shops, hotels and pubs, then report back on the service you receive. Pay depends upon the agency, so make sure to look around for what suits you.\n2. Adopt a dog for a couple of hours.\nIf you love animals, then you're in luck. You can get paid to look after someone's pet for them. When owners are away on holiday, you visit their house a few times a day to look after their pet, and you can charge extra to walk or groom them.\n3. Take your spot in the background.\nA load of TV shows and movies need extras to sit in the background, or even take an active role, like this guy.\n4. Tell companies what you think of their websites.\nGet cash by answering questions and giving feedback on websites for public services, museums, and companies like Apple and Twitter. You don't need to be a tech expert or have an eye for design, as these companies are looking for feedback on how user-friendly their websites are.\n5. Sell your crafts in your spare time.\nIf you're a dab hand at the sewing machine or know your way around screen printing, consider selling your crafts. Websites like Etsy and Redbubble let you sell your creations or designs, and you may even luck out and create a really successful online shop.\n6. Sell your holiday snaps online.\nWhether you're an amateur photographer or you just have some pretty holiday photos, stock photo sites are always looking for new images to sell. You sign up as a contributor and upload your photos to websites like Shutterstock or Fotalia, and get a cut when they sell your images.\n7. Answer market research questions through video.\nThe pay is better than most other types of survey sites, and you don't need to be at a computer to do it. You just give your opinions and answers on things you like and dislike to companies from your smartphone or webcam. A survey takes around 20 minutes or so and you get paid within 24 hours.\n8. Edit other people's work.\nIt's not the most glamorous job, but the pay for proofreading is pretty decent. There are a bunch of freelance proofreading jobs out there, from people wanting their novel read through, to website articles that need the copy looked over.\n9. Go back to secondary school.\nBeing paid to work in silence is the stuff dreams are made of. Lots of schools and universities advertise online for one-off or temp roles as invigilators, which is a great way to earn extra cash if you have free time during weekdays.\n10. Freelance articles and copy.\nIf you're someone who enjoys writing, consider writing articles freelance for a bit of extra cash. A lot of publications accept pitches and pay for one-off contributions, from websites looking for personal essays to those looking for articles on tech support. You can also find freelance work writing marketing copy.\n11. Knock out some websites.\nThis sounds super hard, but if you know a thing or two about CMSs and writing, you can pull together a simple custom website or online shop using a template, enter in the client's content, and make a good amount of extra cash. You can advertise for free on online classifieds, and can charge for SEO and",

You can work evenings and work from your bed, so it's a comfortable way to get a bit more money.\n13. Hit up charity shops.\nLook for pretty jewellery and bargain tech you can sell online. This takes a lot of work, as you have to post items out and offer support when things go wrong, but if you have a good eye, you can find some pretty valuable things in charity shops.\nSaving for a house can be really difficult, but luckily there are loads of ways to make a bit of extra cash and ease the pain.\nWith Halifax's new Help to Buy: ISA, you could get the help you need to step onto the property ladder.",

        "prompt": "By the time school starts this fall, each state is required to inform parents and the general public about whether individual schools in the state have made adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the No Child Left Behind Act. However, schools in some states also receive a rating based on their state's own rating system using additional state-developed criteria. Do states’ rating systems tend to differ from the federal system and if so, how? How many states assign ratings to all of their schools based on criteria other than AYP? Where are those states located? How did they perform on the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) when compared to states without independent rating systems for schools? These are questions addressed this week in the Stat of the Week.\nState rating systems have received considerable attention because results under such systems may differ from AYP determinations. Under the more than four-year old federal law, states must establish AYP targets-- goals for the percentage of students reaching or exceeding the \"proficient\" level on state reading and math tests. In order to make AYP, a school must meet these targets not only for its overall student population but also for students in major subgroups such as low-income brackets, racial/ethnic groups, limited English-proficiency, and students with disabilities.\nIndependent state rating systems however may rely on overall student performance and criteria other than NCLB subgroups to assess schools, or incorporate AYP criteria in whole or in part giving individual schools letter grades, stars or other labels to indicate performance level. Florida for example, in 1999 became the first state to give all of its schools letter grades based on a point system. Schools receive one point for each percent of students scoring well on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) as well as those with annual learning gains and for producing achievement gains with the lowest performing students.\nResearch conducted for Quality Counts 2006 found that 28 states assigned ratings to all schools based on state-developed criteria for the 2005-06 school year. States with their own rating systems do not fall into a simple geographic pattern. In fact, as the map below shows, such systems",
        "baseline": " can be found in each region of the country. However, eleven states in the South have established their own rating systems while relatively few Plains states (4) have done so. Historically, states in the South have tended to score lower on national measures of academic performance and have been more likely to pursue aggressive standards-based reform measures such as state rating systems for schools.\nStates with their own rating systems, on average, scored slightly below states without such systems on 2005 NAEP 4th grade reading tests. As the chart below indicates, fourth-graders in states with their own independent rating systems had an average scale score of 217 on NAEP reading tests while fourth-graders in states without such systems had an average scale score of 219. This finding helps to describe the characteristics of states with rating systems. No causal relationship, between NAEP scores and these state policies, is being suggested.\nFor more on state policies, please see Quality Counts 2006 or visit the Ed Counts database.",

Evacuees huddle on blankets on gymnasium floors, waiting futilely for word of compensation and relocation.\nSuch scenes fill the flurry of independent films inspired by Japan�s March 2011 catastrophe at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant that tell stories of regular people who became overnight victims � stories the creators feel are being ignored by mainstream media and often silenced by the authorities.\nNearly two years after the quake and tsunami disaster, the films are an attempt by the creative minds of Japan�s movie industry not only to confront the horrors of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, but to empower the victims by telling their story for international audiences.\nThe impact these films have on the global and Japanese audiences could perhaps even help change Japan, the directors say.\nWhat�s striking is that many of the works convey a prevailing message: The political, scientific and regulatory establishment isn�t telling the whole truth about the nuclear disaster. And much of the public had been in the past ignorant and uncaring about Fukushima.\nAnd so the films were needed, the auteurs say. The people leading Japan were too evasive about the true consequences of the multiple meltdowns at Fukushima � minimizing people�s suffering, playing down health risks and shrugging off accountability for past go-go pro-nuclear government policies.\n�Japan�s response is ambiguous and irresponsible. But, meanwhile, time is passing,� said Atsushi Funahashi, director of �Nuclear Nation,� which documented the story of the residents of Futaba, Fukushima, the town where the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant is located.\nThe entire town became a no-go zone � contaminated by radiation in the air, water and ground after the tsunami destroyed the plant�s cooling systems, causing meltdowns in three reactors. Decommissioning the reactors is expected to take decades.\nOf all Fukushima communities forced to evacuate, Futaba chose the farthest spot from the nuclear plant � an abandoned high school in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo. That choice, Funahashi feels, highlights a keen awareness of the dangers of radiation and distrust of officials as the town had been repeatedly told the plant was safe.\nThe outburst of post-disaster filmmaking includes Americans living in or visiting Japan, such as �Surviving Japan� by Christopher Noland, �Pray for Japan� by Stuart Levy and �In the Grey Zone� and �A2� by Ian Thomas Ash.\n�The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom,� by Lucy Walker, a Briton, was nominated for the 2012 Academy Award in short documentaries.\nBoth Levy and Noland volunteered in the disaster areas. Ash�s documentaries focus on the plight of the children who continue to live near the nuclear plant, and the frightened mothers who suspect the medical authorities are lying about the safety of radiation.\nFunahashi�s �Nuclear Nation,� shown at film festivals including Berlin, Seoul and Edinburgh, Scotland, intentionally played out its scenes in real time to communicate the helplessness of the days slipping away for displaced people. Camera close-ups show the cold lunches in boxes being handed out, day by day.\nFunahashi is outraged that, so many months later, the Japanese government has yet to properly compensate the 160,000 people who had to leave their homes near Fukushima Dai-ichi. The government has set up tiny temporary housing and has doled out aid calculated to approximate the minimum wage.\nIn one moving scene in �Nuclear Nation,� one of the displaced residents, Masayoshi Watanabe, lights up a cigarette in a car and talks directly into the camera, strangely more movie-like than any Hollywood actor.\n�Our town is gone. It�s just land,� he says pensively.\nThe movie started with 1,400 people in the school building, but that has dwindled lately to about 100. Funahashi is determined to keep filming until the last person leaves.\nReputed director Sion Sono has also written and directed the sarcastically titled �The Land of Hope,� departing from his usual ruthlessly violent avant-garde for a",

Japanese mainstream media had abandoned the no-go zone, and he felt it was up to freelance reporters like him to tell the true story, especially for the helpless elderly.",

Don't forget to pack a hat, sunscreen and water bottle — you can refill it at free festival water stations — to stave off sunburns and dehydration. Also, with speakers blaring music all day, consider bringing ear protection, though earplugs will be available at information booths in case you forget.\nUnless your pet is a service animal, leave it at home. Given the loud noises, large crowds and usually hot days, pets can easily become overwhelmed and uncomfortable in a festival setting.\nOutside alcohol, illegal drugs, weapons, glass bottles, umbrellas, fireworks, selfie sticks, large backpacks, lawn chairs and coolers are all NewWestFest no-nos. All personal items are subject to search throughout the festival, and festival-goers should expect all-day bag checks at the Mountain Avenue Stage entrance. Blankets are allowed at the Library Park Stage, and strollers are allowed throughout the festival, with the exception of the Mountain Avenue Stage.\nWhile there are three public parking structures in Old Town, people are still strongly urged to carpool, bike or use public transportation to get the festival. Temporary bike parking will be set up over the weekend, and the city's Downtown Transit Center is located just a couple of blocks away. The MAX line, which runs buses north and south along the Mason Corridor, is a good option for festival-goers looking to park and ride in from another stop.

        "prompt": "What is yoga, and why is it so popular? Yoga is a series of stretches and poses that you do with breathing techniques. It offers the powerful benefits of exercise. And since yoga is gentle, almost anyone can do it, regardless of your age or fitness level.\nYoga is a 5,000-year-old discipline from India. It was developed as a practice to unite the mind and body. There are many branches of yoga. All yoga styles can help balance your body, mind, and spirit, but they achieve it in various ways.\nSome yoga styles are intense and vigorous. Others are relaxing and meditative. No matter which type you choose, yoga is a great way to stretch and strengthen your body, focus your mind, and relax your spirit.\nYoga's gentle movements are a big reason for why it’s so popular. Yoga is good for people who haven't been active in a while. It’s good for people who have certain health conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis. You can change the exercises to fit your needs. But yoga is also great if you're already fit and want a challenging workout. As you become more strong and flexible with yoga, it's easier to do other kinds of exercise like dancing, walking, or swimming.\nReduce your risk for injury. Each yoga pose targets specific muscles. This helps you increase your flexibility and reduce your risk for injury.\nReduce stress. Yoga can help soothe the mind and lower stress levels. It does this by focusing the mind on the moment and the movements.\nIncrease your concentration. A main part of yoga is rhythmic, focused breathing. This can help you focus.\nUnderstand the mind and body connection. Yoga requires you to focus all your energy on each movement or pose exactly. This can help you feel the mind and body work together.\nGain strength and stamina. More vigorous styles of yoga promote strength and stamina.\nImprove balance and stability. Balancing poses require you to use your core muscles. This can help you improve your overall stability.\nImprove posture. Yoga poses strengthen and open tight areas of the body like the shoulders and muscles of the upper back. This can help you keep good posture.\nDevelop body awareness. Yoga requires you to contract or relax specific muscles as you stretch into each pose. This can help you become more aware of your body’s strengths and weaknesses.\nHatha yoga. This form of yoga is the most popular in the U.S. It’s known as the yoga of force. It emphasizes strengthening and purifying the body. It involves physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama).\nIyengar yoga. This style of yoga focuses on alignment. It is fluid and dancelike. It uses props like wooden blocks, straps, chairs, bolsters, and blankets to help you achieve and hold postures you otherwise couldn't hold.\nAshtanga yoga. This kind of yoga is sometimes called ashtanga vinyasa or power yoga. It's intense and fast-paced. It’s designed to build your endurance and strength. You do a series of postures in 1 continuous, flowing movement. You link the motions to breathing patterns.\nBikram yoga. You do this form of yoga in a very hot room, unlike many other types of yoga. Bikram yoga involves a set of 26 postures that you practice twice per session. First you do standing and balance poses. Then you do back bends, forward bends, and twisting postures.\nRestorative yoga. This type of yoga does not use active postures. It focuses instead on the relaxation part of yoga.\nKripalu yoga. This is a gentler, slower-moving style of yoga. It’s between restorative yoga and the more vigorous forms.\nDownward facing dog pose. This strengthens your arms and legs.\nHalf moon pose. This strengthens your legs and ankles.\nPlank pose. This strengthens your arms, wrists, and back.\nLocust pose. This strengthens the back of your torso, legs, and arms.\nIt’s easy to find all kinds of yoga classes. Check with your local community centers. Look at nearby gyms, dance studios, and health clubs. Or, check out Yoga Journal's Yoga Teacher Directory to see regional and national lists of yoga teachers and associations.\nIt is important to find the right yoga style for you and a teacher you like. It’s hard to know what a class is like until you attend it. Even when 2 teachers use the same terms to describe their classes, the classes may be quite different.\nTalk with your healthcare provider before you begin yoga or any other kind of exercise. It's a",
        "baseline": " good idea to take a class with an experienced teacher. Let the teacher know about any health conditions you may have like high blood pressure or arthritis. Tell him or her about any injuries or physical problems. A good teacher will know which exercises are best for you, and tell you which poses to avoid.\nYoga can help you get fit for life. It helps you deal with stress, pick up your child, control your dog, carry groceries, or work in your garden. It also can help to prevent or ease back pain and muscle or joint injury, and give you self-reliance and self-esteem.\nYet, one of the most important benefits of any yoga routine isn't physical — it's the quieting of the mind. The bottom line is learning to pay attention. You fine-tune your attention, beginning with the body, and then moving to the mind. As you get deeper into your practice over the years, you start to see the mental and spiritual benefits.",

        "prompt": "This past week I decided to pick up X-Men Season 1 . I wasn’t to sure at first how I would like seeing only five X-Men and all in yellow and navy spandex, but I figured I could work around that. At first glance of the cover, I thought Beast looked naked without his signature blue fur. On the upside, at least they gave him a cute face. Something else I noticed was that some of the characters I would usually put on the back burner, took center stage this time.\nThe story follows the original five X-Men through their first year as a team. It was nice to see that the writers didn’t focus the entire story on only one member of the team and instead shared the spotlight with each of them. Their fight was one quarter defending a world that hates them, one quarter fighting the Brotherhood, and one half dealing with hormones and uncontrollable super powers.\nIn the first few pages, we get a glimpse into Jean Grey’s life. She not happy about being sent away to be “part of some bald guy’s freak show.” While on the phone with her parents, they try to convince her that it was the best thing for her. She arrives at the school and has a literal run in with Cyclops. It was in that panel I realized Jean has a sense of humor. Not long after her encounter with Cyclops, we meet Angel and the rest of the team.\nWhen we first meet the professor, I can tell his attitude is a little different from what I remember in the animated series, but I can still feel his concern for his X-Men. The few interactions he has with Magneto shows me that even though they are on two different sides, they both respect the power of the other.\nEventually, we get to watch Beast, Angel, Jean, Iceman, and Cyclops go from just living in the same house to becoming a team. We get to see Jean grow as she learns how to use her powers in a fight, has a crush on one of her teammates, deals with her frustrations with the professor and eventually finds love in Cyclops. Cyclops goes from being an under-confident kid to the leader we all learn to love (or hate in some cases). Angel becomes more confident in being a mutant. Beast starts to see Professor’s vision and realizes that being part of the team is bigger than he originally thought. Iceman is the first to willingly take orders from Cyclops and has a great sense of humor while doing it.\nIn the end, the story is everything I had hoped it would be. A little bit of action, a little bit of love and a lot of heart.\nA copy of this graphic novel was provided to me at no cost.\nIf I wasn’t holding the issue in my hands, I wouldn’t have believed that a crossover like Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 could happen. The Doctor and his companions and the crew of the Enterprise-D, all in one eight-issue comic book series from IDW Publishing. The first issue introduces the readers to the story with an invasion by the Borg with their new ally, the Cybermen. The rest of the issue follows the exploits of the Ponds and the Eleventh Doctor in ancient Egypt.\nI’m a Next Generation expert, but I have to admit that I don’t know much about Doctor Who , so I didn’t know the name of the mysterious new ally of the Borg. (I had to consult my Who-loving sister to find out who they were.) The first issue taught me quickly about the Doctor’s personality, however, so I appreciated seeing him in action before his adventures with the Enterprise crew begin. The painted art style is beautiful, and the last shot of Riker felt like I was seeing a photo of an old friend.\nI’m looking forward to seeing the dream team take shape and take action against the cyborg threat, so I’m definitely picking up the next issue of Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 .\nMark was there to do some signings and events along with the rest of the team behind the monthly comic series Supercrooks —Leinil Yu and Gerry Alanguilan, who live in the Philippines themselves, and colorist Sunny Gho, who’s based in Indonesia. I also received some gorgeous new pages from Leinil this week for the next Supercrooks issue.\nAfter gabbing about it here for weeks, I finally finished reading Harvey Pekar’s Cleveland —one of the last things he wrote before he passed away in 2010. It was sad to reflect on his comment that while he enjoyed receiving calls and visits from admirers, he rarely heard from people in the comics community. I live in Cleveland now, and I guess I’m a member of that community. I wish I could contact him to say how much I’ve enjoyed getting to know his work.\nI wrote a piece for my local paper announcing the comic class I’ll be co-teaching with cartoonist Len Peralta, for 12- to 18-year olds. If you know any geeky or comic-loving teens in the",
        "baseline": " Cleveland area, please send ‘em our way!\nAnd most importantly to me, I spent the week with my lovely family, including a trip to the local comic shop and library with my little girl. One of the things we picked up was a magazine for preschoolers that included some stories in comic format. It’s pretty fascinating to see how young children take in, say, word balloons as opposed to regular illustrated prose. Also, how common it is to see comic stories in preschool magazines, integrated so seamlessly with the other stories, games, and activities. I never notice the comics community drawing any particular attention to this, but it’s there.\nOn my comics reading list for the coming week are a Yo Gabba Gabba comic my daughter picked out; Supercrooks #3 and The Secret Service #2 , which I edited; Saga #3 , which I didn’t; and the graphic novel Are You My Mother? by Alison Bechdel.",

The sensors have an eye toward mobile VR and integrate inside-out positional tracking tech, allowing an attached headset to track the user’s location within a space.\nThe entry-level Fingo module boasts hand tracking and what the company calls “marker-based positional tracking,” a system that basically just tracks your location in reference to an external visual marker that you have to set up in view of the headset.\nThe Color Fingo adds inside-out six degrees-of-freedom positional tracking while the color cameras allow for augmented reality overlays via passthrough cameras.\nThe Power Fingo interestingly has its own Snapdragon processor, which allows the device to handle the computing required for positional tracking and hand tracking without putting a strain on the CPU of mobile-VR headsets.\nAccompanying the launch of its Fingo hardware, the company is launching its uDev network to assist developers looking to integrate uSens’ tech into their hardware or software.\nThe sensor hardware the company is showing off is just for developers; uSens CTO Dr. Yue Fei assured me that the company has little intention of getting in the consumer hardware business and is entirely focused on having its hand-tracking software adopted by manufacturers. Ideally, these hand/positional-tracking solutions will be incorporated directly into the headsets themselves.\nThis has so far seemed to be an oddly difficult sell to mainstream headset manufacturers, which have largely seemed to focus on building their own proprietary hand-tracking tech from the ground up. With Fingo, uSens will likely have an added advantage thanks to the inside-out positional tracking offered on the Color Fingo and Power Fingo models.\nWhen it comes to sensor tech, the only thing that can generally be better about one company’s solution over the other is the software’s accuracy.",

        "prompt": "The speech from the throne in the Ontario legislature promised less government and more respect for people. As Sean O'Shea reports, the new Doug Ford progressive conservative government reiterated it's plan to axe cap and trade, and to reduce Hydro and gasoline prices.\nHere in Alberta where I reside, there is a not insignificant segment of the adult population that has never known the old ALCB (Alberta Liquor Control Board) and that would likely offer little more than a blank stare if asked about it.\nThe ALCB was created in the aftermath of prohibition’s repeal in Alberta and the agency enjoyed tight control over liquor retail for decades. Government-run liquor stores have been extinct for a quarter of a century now, though, and you’d be hard-pressed to find an Albertan who longs for a return to a state-run monopoly.\nThat perspective adds a rather surreal element to any Ontario visit. Setting foot in an LCBO store is what I imagine it would be like if Alberta had a museum specifically dedicated to the ALCB. It’s therefore encouraging to see that it’s not just us Alberta snobs who view Ontario’s liquor retail landscape as horribly antiquated.\nThe Ontario PC party had promised during the recent election campaign to overhaul the province’s liquor retail system, and Thursday’s throne speech makes it clear that they intend to move very quickly on fulfilling that promise. The sale of beer and wine will be expanded to convenience stores, grocery stores and big-box stores, although it appears as though the LCBO and The Beer store, which currently enjoy a quasi-monopoly, will remain.\nThere has been much handwringing that has preceded this decision, and it’s very difficult to see why. The sky has not fallen in Alberta, where liquor retail was long ago privatized, or in the other provinces where there have been varying degrees of privatization — including Quebec, where beer and wine have long been sold in convenience stores.\nIf it’s social harm that we are to fear, then it should be noted that the province that has long had Canada’s highest impaired driving rate is the province that long clung to its government monopoly: Saskatchewan. Such an argument also overlooks the fact that we trust these very same private retailers to oversee the sale of tobacco and lottery tickets. What’s needed are rules around the sale of the product and enforcement of those rules.\nIf it’s higher prices we are to fear, then that argument is hard to reconcile with an argument about social harm, but it should also be noted that Quebec’s prices are lower than Ontario’s. Alcohol taxes and markups also have a significant bearing on the price of liquor products.\nA 2014 study by the C.D. Howe Institute made the case that Ontario could indeed lower prices through more competition, while at the same time bringing in more revenue. Researchers found that provinces with more competition, such as B.C. and Alberta, brought in about seven per cent more per capita than provinces with state-run monopolies.\nThere is really no case to be made for the existence of any such monopoly or quasi-monopoly, and",
        "baseline": " this demonstrates the many ways in which such a scheme distorts the market and harms consumers. The only controversy around Ontario’s new policy directive should be that it took this long to finally bring about this change.\nA case could be made for such changes here in Alberta, too, although it would represent a considerable amount of upheaval for existing private retailers. Alberta opted for creating the narrow lane where private retailers could sell liquor, but only liquor. It led to the odd spectacle of supermarkets being allowed to sell alcohol, but only in separate buildings. However, given the amount of choice and convenience that exists in Alberta, it’s not the kind of change that many are clamouring for.\nWhere we’ve seen change in Canada, though, it’s been in the direction of liberalization and privatization. Support for the anachronism that is the state liquor retail monopoly continues to dwindle. Ontario’s move represents a huge step in the right direction.",

        "prompt": "Colorado currently has some of the strictest policies governing oil and gas production, including fracking and barring development within 500 feet of occupied buildings and 1000 feet of schools and hospitals. That’s substantially more than the national average of 308 feet.\nBut now, Colorado voters are being asked to decide whether to extend those setbacks even further. Proposition 112 would increase oil and gas setbacks to 2,500 feet, thereby banning most oil and gas development — and destroying many of the more than 230,000 jobs supported by the oil and gas industry.\nThere are two problems with the health argument for Proposition 112.\nThe health benefits are imaginary.\nProposition 112 will cause enormous harm to health by increasing poverty.\nLet’s start with the health benefits of Proposition 112, which are supposed to come from improving air quality for Coloradans near oil and gas wells.\nWhen oil and gas come out of the ground it’s possible for “volatile organic compounds” (VOCs) such as the carcinogen Benzene, to be released into the air.\nVOCs are not unique to oil and gas projects. Benzene and other VOCs are emitted from thousands of everyday sources like car traffic, gas stations, glues, paints and detergents. In all cases they can be dangerous — but only if they exist in high enough quantities.\nShould Coloradans be afraid of VOCs from oil and gas more than 500 feet away?\nTo answer that question, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) examined 10,000 air samples from areas where there is substantial oil and gas activity. They found that concentrations of potentially hazardous substances were at worst one-fourth safety thresholds and in many cases one-five-thousandth safety thresholds.\nBut what about the “growing body of medical studies” Proposition 112 supporters say demonstrates “an increased risk of negative health impacts” from shale energy development 500 to 2,500 feet away?\nTry reading one of these “studies” carefully and you’ll see that they are not cause for alarm. For example, a recent paper by University of Colorado assistant professor Lisa McKenzie has been used by Proposition 112 supporters to claim that oil and gas development beyond 500 feet significantly increases the risk of cancer.\nNot only has that paper been rightly criticized for extreme speculation; it doesn’t even apply to Proposition 112. The paper speculates only that populations living less than 500 feet from an oil and gas facility will have their normal 30-40% risk of cancer go down by .1 percent if oil and gas development is prohibited.\nIt is for this phony health benefit that Proposition 112 supporters are trying to destroy most oil and gas development–and therefore many of their neighbors’ jobs. But what about the health harms of destroying them?\nSince natural gas is by far the dominant source of energy for Colorado, banning local natural gas drilling will raise energy prices throughout the state. That harms everyone–especially healthcare providers. Hospitals are some of the largest consumers of electricity, with energy costs often making up half of their budgets.\nAny increase in the price of energy means that hospitals have to reduce the medical services they offer or charge patients more: either way, fewer Coloradans will be able to get the healthcare they need.\nWorse, Proposition 112 will harm health by impoverishing Coloradans inside and outside of oil and gas.\nThe oil and gas industry is one of the most important in Colorado, directly or indirectly employing hundreds of thousands of residents, benefiting hundreds of thousands of mineral rights owners who have received hundreds of millions in royalties from the industry, and producing billions in GDP and tax revenues.\nOne recent study on the impact of Proposition 112 estimated that it would cost 33,500 to 43,000 jobs in the first year and 115,000 to 147,800 jobs by 2030, while reducing GDP in the state by at least $110 billion between 2019 and 2030.\nThis means Proposition 112 will cause a lot of preventable poverty.\nWe know that lower incomes are associated with worse health outcomes since income impacts things like our ability to afford healthy food, preventative health care, quality health insurance, and costly medical treatments.\nFor example, poor adults report being in fair or poor health five times as often adults in families making more than $100,000. For children, lower incomes are associated with higher rates",
        "baseline": " of asthma, heart conditions, and other ailments. And lower incomes translate into significantly lower expected lifespans.\nThese differences don’t just apply to the very rich and the very poor either. The less wealthy you are, the less healthy you are: even Americans in the top 10 percent of incomes have worse health outcomes on average than Americans in the top 1% of incomes. Any policy that harms prosperity harms health.\nIf Proposition 112 is passed there is no guarantee that even one person will live an extra month because a distant oil rig was destroyed. But there is a guarantee that millions will suffer unnecessarily from increased poverty — health-wise and across the board.\nBy seeking to deprive Colorado of affordable, reliable energy–and the prosperity that comes from producing that energy–it is the advocates of Proposition 112 who are the real dangers to Coloradans’ health.\nAlex Epstein is author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels and founder of the Center for Industrial Progress.",

Not much.\nTo remedy that, I hearby declare January 29 to be National Microbusiness Day.\nAnd so, Happy Microbusiness Day.\nThis raises two questions, of course. What is a microbusiness and why are we celebrating it.\nBack when the term was first employed, folks used it to describe organizations with less than five employees.\nToday it is used to describe what we used to call \"soloists,\" people who work independently and usually alone or with a support person or two. These would be artists, consultants freelancers of all strips, musicians and the like.\nOkay, but why celebrate these people?\nThere are three major reasons.\n1. They are almost never recognized when the discussion turns to entrepreneurs and small business. The spotlight is invariably placed on businesses that are trying to scale. There is nothing wrong with that. But you can certainly be in business even if you never want that business to bigger than what you can control yourself.\n2.",

But everything I have read seems to suggest that microbusinesses--used in the conventional sense of five employees or less--are more than 90 percent of the economy.\n3.

The best job or even the best industry may not be here tomorrow.\nSince that is the case, we all have to be prepared to entrepreneurs, or at least master entrepreneurial thought and action, as I have written about before.\nb) Serve as something more should you find yourself out of a job.\nSo, at the very least, it will serve as a form of employment insurance. At the very best, it could lead to a successful new career.\nThat, too, seems like an idea worth celebrating.",

        "prompt": "Penn State coach James Franklin calls Saquon Barkley a ‘legend’ who will influence the football program for years to come.\nNEW YORK — As he watched Saquon Barkley hold his new jersey on draft night, Penn State coach James Franklin recalled the steps that led to the moment.\nFranklin remembered recruiting trips, meeting with administrators at Whitehall High School and a visit to the Barkley's home in Coplay. And, of course, Barkley's career at Penn State.\n\"That moment,\" Franklin said, \"was pretty powerful.\"\nPrior to Penn State's Coaches Caravan stop Tuesday in Manhattan, Franklin reminisced about the running back who prompted the coach's first trip to the NFL draft. Franklin also said that Barkley's legacy will live long in State College and will help fuel the 2018 team.\n\"When your best player is one of your better workers, and is high-production, low-maintenance, it sets the tone for the organization,\" Franklin said. \"That's when guys leave the program and they're legends. To me, that's what Saquon is.\"\nBarkley, who begins his first rookie minicamp with the New York Giants this weekend, has plenty to learn about the NFL, Franklin said. But the running back has an \"NFL-ready body\" and a mature approach to the game that will ease his transition.\n\"He's not one of these guys who feels like he's arrived,\" Franklin said. \"This is just the beginning for him.\"\nFurther, Franklin said that Barkley's legacy at Penn State will have an impact the Lions' future. Barkley's success made fellow players \"hungrier,\" Franklin said, and his off-field approach resonated as well.\n\"People saw the type of investment he made, and have the type of success that he had, but at the end of the day you're still going to be remembered by how you treat people,\" Franklin said. \"I think he's left a legacy at Penn State from that perspective.\"\nPitt series on hold: Pitt Athletic Director Heather Lyke said recently that she's waiting to hear from Penn State regarding the renewal of their football series in 2026.\nOn Tuesday, Penn State Athletic Director Sandy Barbour said that she doesn't expect the series to return for at least four years after that.\n\"It's a complicated puzzle,\" Barbour said prior to Penn State's Coaches Caravan in Manhattan. \"We're probably not going to do anything at this point until maybe some point after 2030.\"\nLast month, Lyke told reporters in Pittsburgh that she had proposed another four-year series between the two teams beginning in 2026. Lyke said that Pitt would wait \"patiently\" for Penn State to respond, though not for much longer.\n\"Out of the respect for Penn State and the opportunity within the Commonwealth, we want to play Penn State,\" Lyke said. \"If they don't, we will obviously shift gears.\"\nBarbour said Tuesday that she has had conversations with Lyke, adding that both programs have",
        "baseline": " agreed to postpone the potential renewal. As she has done before, Barbour cited the Big Ten's nine-game conference schedule as a mitigating factor.\nPenn State and Pitt will play the third game of their current four-game series Sept. 8 at Heinz Field. The series ends in 2019 at Beaver Stadium.\nThe teams played annually from 1935-1992, then resumed their series with four games from 1997-2000.\nRegarding September's game at Heinz Field, Barbour said she has not received an official start time, despite the Pittsburgh Pirates changing their schedule that day to accommodate a potential night football game.\nLast month, the Pirates shifted the start time for their Sept. 8 game at PNC Pack to 1:05 p.m., saying it would \"allow for Saturday night college football on the North Shore.\"\n\"I haven't heard a game time [for Penn State-Pitt], so I'm not quite sure what the Pirates were doing,\" Barbour said.",

An English teacher, interpreter translator (English to Spanish) who studied classical literature and “all of that enriched my perception of the culinary act in humans,” as she describes, is on her maiden trip to India.\nThe Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi, is celebrating the flavours of Mexico in a food festival with Chef Alondra Maldonada and Executive Chef Arun Sundararaj.\n“It is a gracious opportunity to work with Chef Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef and his team at the wonderful The Taj Mahal Hotel New Delhi. The Taj and the Embassy of Mexico in Delhi has invited me to put this experience together and I am thrilled to add this to my culinary journey,” explained Chef.\nStarting out very young as a chef and being the youngest of the 11, Chef’s mother was a dedicated house wife. “At home, everything was made from the scratch – tortillas were hand-made every day – and one of the ruling activities at home was making food and sharing it. So I always cooked and I enjoyed cooking. Whenever I was working and translating something, my most genuine way of expressing was cooking. Until one day, I met with a car accident, and that made me realise my worth of doing something that I was passionate about. And hence, I opened a restaurant…. And later on I went to culinary school in Argentina,” she remembers.\nChef likes to explore and express through flavours. She has read about many great chefs in India at the Taj and with this visit she also looks forward to trying some Indian flavours at Machan & Varq.\nMeeting other chefs excites her that further brings in a rich cultural exchange of ideas, different cooking techniques and varied traditions.\nAt the festival, Chef has mainly used seafood, shrimp, fish, octopus and dry peppers as main ingredients in the cooking techniques. “Just to cook with all my heart the traditional flavours of Nayarit (my home state), and other parts of Mexico especially Oaxaca. Chef Arun & I have been communicating very",

It is used in mole sauces, soups with seafood. And of course, maize, the sacred grain. “I believe that Mexican cuisine is a celebration to maize, it takes different shapes, different names, and tastes different and is always present. We had to send 70 kg of dry peppers for this event,” she said.\nFor Chef, healthy eating comes from the crux of any cuisine.

        "prompt": "Are US tech giants the new robber barons of the 21st century, banking billions in profit while short-changing the public by paying only a pittance in tax? With public coffers still strained years after the worst of the debt crisis, EU leaders have agreed to tackle the question.\nTax rules today are designed for yesterday's economy when US multinationals — such as General Motors, IBM or McDonald's — entered countries loudly, with new factories, jobs and more taxes for the taking.\nThese firms had what tax specialists call \"permanent establishment\", when companies showed a clear physical presence measured and taxed through tangible, real world assets. But today in most EU nations, the US tech titans exist almost exclusively in the virtual world, their services piped through apps to smart phones and tablets from designers and data servers oceans away.\nGhost-like, Silicon Valley has turned Europe's economies upside down, but often with just a skeleton staff and some office space in markets with millions of users or customers.\nAccording to EU law, to operate across Europe, multi­nationals have almost total liberty to choose a home country of their choosing. Not surprisingly, they choose small, low tax nations such as Ireland. Thus, it is through Ireland that Facebook draws its wealth from millions of accounts across Europe.\nWhile users enjoy the platform, Facebook tracks likes, comments and page views and sells the data to companies who then target consumers.\nBut unlike the economy of old, Facebook sells its data to French companies not from France but from a great, nation-less elsewhere, with no phone number, address or physical \"presence\" for a customer who probably cares little. It is in states like Ireland, whose official tax rate of 12.5 per cent is the lowest in Europe, that the giants have parked their EU headquarters and book profits from revenues made across the bloc.\nIndeed, actual revenues from advertising are minimal in France and Germany, but at Facebook HQ Ireland they grew to 7.9 billion euros, even though the vast majority does not come from the tiny EU island-nation of a mere 2.5 million users.\nGoogle follows the same pattern: in Germany in 2015, it had a little over 71 million users, in France just over 55 million. But in both nations, revenues are minimal. Yet, in Ireland, where the number of search engine users is less than five million, revenues for Google-parent Alphabet reached 22.6 billion euros in 2015.\nAccording to an analysis by Paul Tang, a specialist on tax issues at the European Parliament, France lost 741 million euros in tax revenue and Germany 889 million euros between 2013 and 2015 due to so-called \"tax planning\" by Google and Facebook. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development believes that such tax schemes cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate. \"The actual activity of each company, including US tech giants, is not known,\" said Manon Aubry, spokeswoman for the NGO Oxfam.\n\"Beyond the number of accounts or users in each country, it would be necessary to know in the case of Google for example, the amount of advertising sales in each country. We do not have it.\" For car-ride smartphone service Uber, \"we need to know the number of rides, but we don't have it,\" she said. \"One of the first issues, therefore, is that of transparency: to rule that large companies publish data on activities and taxes paid in all the countries where they are present.\"\nTo the European Commission, the digital shortfall on tax is clear. The effective tax rate on the profit of digital giants in the EU averages only nine per cent, while that of traditional companies exceeds 20 per cent, it said.\nApple, also based in Ireland, became one of the EU's most emblematic tax cases when Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager ordered the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back-taxes. Vestager said",
        "baseline": " the US giant had benefitted from illegal state aid, a gift from Ireland in exchange for choosing Dublin as its headquarters, with thousands of jobs at stake in the deal.\nBrussels says Dublin's red carpet treatment accorded Apple an effective corporate tax rate of one per cent on its European profits in 2003 — a rate that decreased to a scant 0.005 per cent in 2014 — just a fraction of the official rate. \"It's total political crap,\" Apple chief executive Tim Cook barked at the time. Undeterred, Vestager has gone after similar arrangements, such as those revealed in the Luxleaks scandal that exposed deals struck between Luxembourg and a long list of multinationals, including online US retail giant Amazon.\nFaced with this situation, solutions are under study. France has proposed an unusual idea that has so far divided Europe: tax the US tech giants on sales generated in each European country, rather than on the profits that are cycled through low-tax countries.",

The general became the specific, and it didn't take long for Apple's rivals to lash out.\nIn general, antenna performance of a mobile device/phone may be affected with a tight grip, depending on how the device is held. That's why Nokia designs our phones to ensure acceptable performance in all real life cases, for example when the phone is held in either hand. Nokia has invested thousands of man hours in studying how people hold their phones and allows for this in designs, for example by having antennas both at the top and bottom of the phone and by careful selection of materials and their use in the mechanical design.\nApple's attempt to draw RIM into Apple's self-made debacle is unacceptable. Apple's claims about RIM products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public's understanding of an antenna design issue and to deflect attention from Apple's difficult situation. RIM is a global leader in antenna design and has been successfully designing industry-leading wireless data products with efficient and effective radio performance for over 20 years. During that time, RIM has avoided designs like the one Apple used in the iPhone 4 and instead has used innovative designs which reduce the risk for dropped calls, especially in areas of lower coverage.\nOne thing is for certain, RIM’s customers don’t need to use a case for their BlackBerry smartphone to maintain proper connectivity. Apple clearly made certain design decisions and it should take responsibility for these decisions rather than trying to draw RIM and others into a situation that relates specifically to Apple.\nNext we have HTC, whose Droid Eris was another unwitting guest star. Bear in mind that Steve Jobs admitted the iPhone 4 had caused 0.55",
        "baseline": " percent of users to ring AppleCare to report reception problems. According to Pocket-Lint, that's about 34 times the number of Droid Eris customers who'd complained about such things.\nThe Wall Street Journal also quotes HTC's CFO as saying \"reception problems are certainly not common among smartphones\", adding for good measure that Apple \"apparently didn't give operators enough time to test the phone\".\nBased on years of experience of designing high-quality phones, Samsung mobile phones employ an internal antenna design technology that optimizes reception quality for any type of hand grip.\nTo sum up, pretty much all of Apple's rivals have just told the company to stop trying to claim the antenna issue is the whole industry's problem. There is a spot of truth to what Apple is claiming (although, surely we'd have heard about this before if it was that generalised a problem) but calling out rivals by name has made it very easy for those companies to call Apple out in return.",

        "prompt": "This past Oct. 8, the city of Binghamton celebrated its annual Columbus Day Parade. This event was filled with varieties of food and included a marching band. Some are appalled by the way we still celebrate Columbus Day, while others do not see genocide when they are celebrating an annual city tradition.\nBefore Columbus set sail in 1492 to what would later be considered the “new land,” there existed hundreds of native tribes and empires all throughout the Western Hemisphere. As children, we grew up with the holiday of Columbus Day and didn’t question it much. A day off of school for the celebration of the person teachers made us believe was an international hero seemed like a great excuse to miss class. Although we learned that native tribes occupied the lands, textbooks and our past curricula praise Columbus due to his “heroic” actions. I personally was taught in elementary school to look at Columbus as a figure in history who benefited mankind. He was, in fact, beneficial, but only if one is looking at history through the eyes of a European. Today, we are finally moving away from Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day and some are still trying to get used to this switch.\nSo what is Indigenous Peoples Day?\nIndigenous Peoples Day recognizes the culture and influence that Native Americans, who were the first to inhabit this continent, have had on the Americas. This holiday originated in the early 1990s, and Mayor Loni Hancock of Berkeley, California, aimed to make Berkeley the first city to formally recognize the culture of Native Americans on a day that has been centralized on European colonial accolades. Soon after, other cities and states followed, with Santa Cruz adopting this holiday in 1994 and Seattle in 2014. During recent years, the number of states and cities that have been celebrating this holiday and the achievement of Native Americans has risen dramatically.\nWill Columbus continue to be idolized?\nMany cities and towns throughout the Americas have erected statues recognizing Columbus and other European explorers who arrived to a land only to pillage the soil and its peoples. Columbus is most often placed as a statue or monument because many believed he was the first to discover the Americas. As a matter of fact, Leif Erikson, who was a Norse explorer, along with the Vikings actually landed in the “New World” centuries before Columbus. Regardless, famous monuments such as Columbus Circle have been attracting a lot of controversy in the past decade. Many believe his “idol” image should be destroyed, while others want to keep this part of history in place. Although it is a controversial topic, there are arguments supporting both sides.\nNative American heroes, which include but are not limited to Chief Pontiac, Geronimo and Chief Victorio, are historical figures that should receive more recognition. Society today should put an emphasis on these names along with other accomplished Native Americans in order to showcase and shine a light on a rich and hidden culture. Latin American countries that also have a rich Native American history are also beginning to recognize the importance tribes and empires",
        "baseline": " have had on the land in today’s society.\nSo why celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day?\nColumbus is most notably recognized for discovering the Americas, which is false. We are also taught that he established a friendly relationship with the natives of the area. Now, it is clear that Columbus colonized an area with native inhabitants and stripped them of their culture, resources and land throughout the centuries. In addition, this holiday perpetuates the idea that Native Americans existed centuries ago and do not exist today. Although they are a minority in this country today, Native Americans still continue to celebrate their culture and make up a vital part of American history and our society today. Even though many cities have established this holiday, that does not mean that they abolished Columbus Day. Recognizing this holiday brings attention to the genocide of one of the original inhabitants of this continent. This not only helps us understand and connect with the dark side of American history, but understanding our past allows us to learn for the future.",

        "prompt": "U.S. Consulate Attacked in Saudi Arabia | Democracy Now!\nAt least nine people were killed yesterday when gunmen stormed the US consulate in the Saudi Arabian city in Jeddah and fought a three-hour battle with security forces.\nFour of the attackers and five non-U.S. staff were killed. In a phone call, the attackers called themselves the “Fallujah Brigades.” The Iraqi city of Fallujah is the scene of a large-scale assault by US forces in which as many as 1,800 people have been killed. A group calling itself “al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula” later claimed responsibility.\nIt was the first attack against a Western diplomatic mission in Saudi Arabia and first big strike in six months. Officials say the assailants followed an official consulate car into the complex, firing guns and hurling grenades to force entry. After coordinating with U.S. Marines providing security to the consulate, Saudi forces stormed the compound.\nSaudi Arabia has been battling a wave of violence since May 2003. Around 170 people, including foreigners, security forces and militants have been killed.\nAMY GOODMAN: We turn now to As’ad AbuKhalil. He’s professor of political science at California State University, Stanislaus, currently a visiting professor at U.C. Berkeley, and the author of several books, including The Battle for Saudi Arabia: Royalty, Fundamentalism and Global Power. He runs a new blog called the Angry Arab News Service. Democracy now! welcomes you, As’ad AbuKhalil.\nAMY GOODMAN: Your response to this latest attack on Monday.\nAS’AD ABUKHALIL: Well, I think this is a sign of increasing signs that the country may be slipping out of the control of the House of Saud. I think that there are increasing indications that the dissent in Saudi Arabia and the ability of people on the fanatical side of the al Qaeda types are able to strike inside the kingdom with such dare and ability to infiltrate sometimes extremely secure areas. The Arabic press is reporting that it was extremely impenetrable, the area where this time they struck. And every time they strike, it seems that there are signs of cooperation between them and various branches of the security forces. This comes only a few days after a dissident website reported that the House of Saud invited thousands of Jordanian troops into the kingdom, which hasn’t been reported in the western press, in order to help them quell dissent and riot control within the kingdom. So I think that based on what al Qaeda types websites have been reporting lately, that there is a rising movement against the House of Saud and even dissent within the House of Saud, especially as many of them have become vocal against the ability of the highly unpopular Minister of Interior, Prince Nayef, to control the street in Saudi Arabia.\nAMY GOODMAN: We’re about to look at Bernard Kerik, the new nominee for Homeland Security chief. He also was head of security for the Saudi royal family. He is the former New York police commissioner. Do you know anything about that?\nAS’AD ABUKHALIL: Well, he was, based on what I read in the Arabic press, he had a very limited role within the kingdom as part of many roles by many American consultants, advisers, who helped the various military intelligence branches of the kingdom. He was technically in charge of security of the hospitals within the kingdom, not for the royal family itself. I think for that, they went for somebody more senior than him, somebody who is more qualified than he is. But it seems the president found that he is qualified to be in charge of Homeland Security.\nAMY GOODMAN: Professor As’ad AbuKhalil has written a new book on Saudi Arabia, The Battle for Saudi Arabia: Royalty, Fundamentalism and Global Power. What have been other sites? In the past, we know about U.S. military contractor compounds being attacked in Saudi Arabia. Do you expect more violence or less right now?\nAS’AD ABUKHALIL: Well, every time I hear reports by the royal family about their ability to quell the dissent and the violence movements within the kingdom, they seem to strike with such dare and I’m also surprised that al",
        "baseline": " Qaeda type websites, those that are very sympathetic to the movement, linked to it, are covering Saudi Arabia with incredible excruciating detail and they seem to have tremendous links within the kingdom. Also, what is noticeable is that the dissident movements operating outside, especially in Europe, seem to be converging toward the bin Laden-type movement, which tells me that there is something going on. It is hard to predict about these things, especially as the royal family is willing to go extremely far in using violence, just as this dissident fanatical movement is able to be very violent in order to protect itself and seems to me that the United States will spare no effort to keep these unpopular royals inside the kingdom in power.\nAMY GOODMAN: As’ad AbuKhalil, I want to thank you very much for being with us.

        "prompt": "It appears either Microsoft has mainframe-envy or IBM is not too happy about Microsoft's data center ambitions of late. Most likely, it's a combination of both.\nMicrosoft recently said it is going to offer portable data centers based on its cloud-based Windows Azure platform.\nIBM just launched a new mainframe that is the first to support virtualization of x86-based blades with Linux, not Windows, as the preferred platform. Big Blue appears cold to the idea of the blade extensions supporting Windows.\nThe European Union last week launched an investigation of IBM's mainframe business. IBM's response: Microsoft and its minions are behind the investigation.\nThe accusations made against IBM by TurboHercules and T3 are being driven by some of IBM's largest competitors -- led by Microsoft -- who want to further cement the dominance of Wintel servers by attempting to mimic aspects of IBM mainframes without making the substantial investments IBM has made and continues to make. In doing so, they are violating IBM's intellectual property rights.\nT3 and TurboHercules offer mainframe software that competes with IBM's own offerings.\nAs for the newly launched mainframe, the zEnterprise is the most important new piece of big iron launched by IBM in more than a decade because it is the first to provide integration with its Power7 blade infrastructure and x86-based blade racks running Linux.\nWhere it breaks new ground is its common virtualized platform capable of running 100,000 VMs simultaneously, while providing a turnkey data center that shares network, storage and power components.\nProviding the capability for the mainframe to assign workloads to x86-based blades is the system's Universal Resource Manager, made up of software and embedded hardware, said IBM Distinguished Engineer Donna Dillenberger, in an interview at the launch event.\nHer colleague, David Gelardi, IBM's vice president of sales, support and education, told me one could opt to run Windows workloads rather than Linux on the x86 BladeCenter Extensions, dubbed zBX.\n\"There's no reason you can't use it to run Windows, because Tivoli's provisioning capabilities is operating systems agnostic,\" he said. \"Windows would run on an outboard blade and ultimately would run on an xBlade inside zBX.\"\nBut at the same time, Steve Mills, senior vice president of IBM's software and hardware businesses, was in another room with analysts playing down that notion. When asked if the blades would run Windows, Mills reportedly said because they are x86-based, Windows could run on it \"but the problem was essentially, to IBM, Windows was too much of a black box to be able to do what they wanted to do with it,\" recalled RedMonk analyst Michael Cote, in an interview.\n\"I don't think IBM is especially interested in managing Windows on the zEnterprise,\" Cote said. \"Technologically it wouldn't work out, and they probably are unwilling to do whatever it would take to make Microsoft help them out with it. But I think in the wider context of things, IBM's not really out to help Microsoft out really.\"\nAnalyst Joe Clabby of Clabby Analytics, in an interview, explained it would require Microsoft to support IBM's virtualization technology and make tweaks to its own Hyper-V. \"Hyper-V is nowhere near IBM from a virtualization and provisioning perspective,\" Clabby said. \"If I were IBM I'd say get that stuff out of the way, use this approach and then you can integrate with our mainframes better, but I don't think that will be received well by Microsoft.\"\nSo both Cote and Clabby are in agreement that we shouldn't anticipate the new zEnterprise running Windows workloads -- at least with the help of Microsoft and IBM -- any time soon.\nAs for the EU investigation: \"I don't know if IBM's allegations that Microsoft is behind it are true, but in this day and age, part of the way you compete is to try to help government agencies do antitrust stuff,\" Cote said. \"Whether it's a good way of competing, it seems like one front in a war of competing.\"\nIs Microsoft really a threat to IBM these days? Cote says certainly more so than it was in the past. \"Microsoft wants to expand into the enterprise area,\" he said. \"If you look at the numbers on Windows server usage, it's everywhere. That's a chunk of revenue that IBM is missing out on.\"\nIt's not just the data center where IBM is taking on Microsoft.

And Microsoft has made it clear that its two biggest enemies are Apple and Google, with VMware and Oracle clearly in its path, as well. The tensions between IBM and Microsoft \"are definitely more active but they're not at each other's throats,\" Cote said.\nClearly it will be interesting to see the two go head to head in the market for so called private clouds \"in a box.\" What's your take?

        "prompt": "If there’s one area of social media seeing real innovation, it’s the use of geolocation. As the integration of location-based services and marketing is still so young, we are constantly seeing new, creative products and campaigns being released which encourage users to share and interact with their location.\nIf your business has not used location-based social media yet, now is as good a time as any to get involved. See the list at the end of the post for some ideas to get you started, but first let’s take a look at how geolocation works, and some impressive examples.\nLet’s start by taking a look at the most common use of geolocation – checking in. Services like Foursquare, Gowalla and Brightkite let users check-in with a mobile device, such as a tablet computer or a smartphone. Check-ins can be shared on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, although Facebook recently released their own check-in service, Facebook Places. Leaving tips is a function available on several of these services, which allows users to find comments, reviews and information about the place they check-in to. Although anyone can leave tips, the History Channel and the Wall Street Journal are notable examples of how extra value can be added with this feature. The History Channel has left photos and information about the history of various locations, while the Wall Street Journal has left restaurant reviews and links to related news articles.\nFoursquare has seen success with other brands too, through marketing partnerships. Starbucks has used Foursquare to offer discounted drinks for Mayors, and an exclusive Barista badge for customers who check-in at five Starbucks restaurants. Mattel and Jimmy Choo both ran scavenger hunts using Foursquare to promote new products. Mattel’s Video Girl Barbie checked-in at locations across the U.S. in July, posting details of each check-in on Foursquare, Facebook, and Twitter. Those who were first to check-in to each location after Barbie did won themselves a Video Girl Barbie. Jimmy Choo’s hunt across London worked in a similar fashion, coinciding with the release of Jimmy Choo’s sneakers. Users who found the sneakers first at each London location they checked-in to won a pair.\nAnother location-based application, SCVNGR, focuses on being a game and making check-ins fun. Using this app, which was recently released internationally, users can create and complete short challenges attached to their location. SCVNGR has teamed up with the Smithsonian Institution to create a specialized trek through its museums, encouraging visitors to interact with the exhibits and compete for points by completing challenges. The New England Patriots also partnered with SCVNGR to create its biggest trek yet, which involved short challenges to win daily prizes during the NFL season and a mystery to solve with clues found at various locations.\nGames have been integrated with geolocation in various ways, but Microsoft’s Fable III: Kingmaker mobile game is a great example. Using the mobile app, users were able to plant virtual flags in locations to stake their claims and earn gold to be used in the Xbox game once it was released. Another location-based game requiring users to check-in was created by Nike in London. Using London’s iconic telephone booths instead of a mobile app, runners checked-in to phone booths by entering their unique player code and earned points for running between the booths.\nTaking the effort out of the game, Coca-Cola Israel used RFID tags shaped like Coke bottle lids to integrate Facebook into the Coca-Cola Village retreat for teenagers earlier this year. The tags were attached to wristbands, allowing the teens visiting the retreat to send information to their Facebook profiles by holding the tag in front of a tag-reader. So for instance, visitors could swipe their tag at the pool and their Facebook profile would be updated, showing that they ‘like’ that attraction, or when a staff member took their picture, they could swipe the RFID tag to automatically tag themselves in the photo when it was uploaded to Facebook.\nFinally, let’s take a look at a whole new way location can help you find a great meal. Street vendors across the U.S. are latching onto Twitter as way to announce their changing locations. The Fojol Bros., Kogi BBQ, and Chez Spencer all use social media to tell customers where to find the travelling food trucks each day. Business review site Yelp allows users to post reviews of restaurants and other businesses, as well as checking-in to share your location and take advantage of Check-in offers.\nLeave tips that are useful to others and relevant to your business – eg: Do you run a travel agency? Leave tips at the best attractions around your city to recommend the experiences to visitors.\nA mass Easter egg-type hunt: imagine 100 people in a park hunting for tokens with geo-tags attached and scanning as many as they can to create a virtual Easter basket full of ‘eggs’, or tokens.\nScavenger hunts: SCVNGR has done this with specialized treks already, but I would love to see it becoming more common. A great place to implement this would be at a theme park or a zoo. Imagine visitors to a zoo who wanted to participate were given a list of clues leading them to different animals around the park, and at each animal enclosure they can check-in and earn points, working towards a prize for those who complete all the clues.\nMobile check-in for airports and doctors’ surgeries: wouldn’t it be great to avoid the airport queue and check yourself",

It would also be the same Susan Rice described by Newsweek as President Obama's \"right-hand woman\" in 2014. As I said on air yesterday, this whole Russia meddling/wiretap saga has become so convoluted and bereft of verifiable facts that it's quite difficult to keep following the plot. Here's my stab at a succinct summation: Our intelligence agencies and members of relevant committees on both sides of the aisle all agree that Moscow tried to meddle in the 2016 election. Their clear preference was to help Donald Trump and damage Hillary Clinton, whom they assumed would win anyway. The Kremlin has also deployed their propaganda and subterfuge to undermine Republicans, too. Their overarching goal is to undercut faith in the American system. And while there is no factual basis for President Trump's counter-claim that his predecessor ordered his phones to be tapped, there are real indications that some people within Trump's orbit were monitored in some way -- and the series of one-sided leaks on that front does look to many like a deliberate push within elements of the government to damage Trump's presidency. There is also no evidence that the Trump campaign coordinated or colluded with the Russians.\nOur sources: This surveillance that led to the unmasking of private names of American citizens started before Trump was the GOP nominee.\nWhite House lawyers last month discovered that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally. Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like \"U.S. Person One.\" The National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was conducting the review, according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice's multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities. He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel's office, who reviewed more of Rice's requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy.\nRice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking. Last month when she was asked on the \"PBS NewsHour\" about reports that Trump transition officials, including Trump himself, were swept up in incidental intelligence collection, Rice said: \"I know nothing about this,\" adding, \"I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes",
        "baseline": " on that account today.\"\nPerhaps there's an innocent explanation for all of this, and perhaps Rice believed she was answering that question accurately. But for previously-alluded-to reasons, it's hardly a stretch to imagine Rice flat-out lying on television. One of the indications that Chairman Nunes really had exposed something significant came last week came when the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff -- who has been loudly attacking his GOP counterpart and spreading unfounded claims and conspiracies related to the Russia probe -- got a look at the same documents Nunes saw (which led to Nunes' subsequent briefing of both President Trump and the news media). As Red State points out, Schiff emerged from that session fixated on process, while remaining notably mum on anything pertaining to content. It's not unreasonable to hypothesize that he read the documents and realized that something damaging lies within. Maybe that something was Barack Obama's lightning-rod NSA repeatedly requesting the unmasking of Trump officials' communications for dubious reasons.",

Only this subject, and no one else, has necessary legal rights to change this territory’s jurisdiction.” And, since Ukraine did not sell Crimea to Russia, Russia “stole” it from Ukraine. He sees the issue of Crimea as being not an issue of people, but of land: the land-area of Crimea, which Russia “stole” from Ukraine — that Russia stole the land and everything in it and under it and on it, including its residents.\nAccording to Illarionov, Crimea’s residents are simply human property there. They belong to Ukraine, no matter what they think. Illarionov’s article doesn’t even so much as discuss whether the 16 March 2014 popular vote of Crimeans in which 97% favored to rejoin Russia (which the Soviet dictator had donated from Russia, to Ukraine, in 1954, without even asking anyone in Crimea their opinion of the matter) reflected accurately the public sentiment among Crimeans (it actually did); that question is simply ignored; but Illarionov does say: “The fact that most of the peninsula’s population are ethnic Russians does not matter either.” In other words: the residents of Crimea should be entirely ignored — not only their opinions but the possible reasons for those opinions.\n“Last week two prominent Ukrainian opposition figures were gunned down in broad daylight. They join as many as ten others who have been killed or committed suicide under suspicious circumstances just this year. These individuals have one important thing in common: they were either part of or friendly with the Yanukovych government, which a US-backed coup overthrew last year. They include members of the Ukrainian parliament and former chief editors of major opposition newspapers.\nTo call both of these viewpoints ‘libertarian’ is to use the very same label for diametrically opposite political positions, which is to nullify any meaning for that label, on that topic — which topic, in this instance. is whether rights inhere in people, or instead in property. That’s a fundamental difference.\nSo: Is libertarianism focused on persons, or on property?\nRon Paul is not an aristocrat, though with his son Rand Paul, he might have created a dynasty and be therefore a first-generation aristocrat, in the purely dynastic sense.\nThat, too, connects today’s libertarianism with that of its founders, ever since the time of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and consistently right through his heirs and their American Liberty League.\nIn the 1930s, the DuPont brothers, and Jasper Crane who married into the DuPont family, created the American Liberty League, which became the model for the Koch brothers’ foundation in 1974 of the Cato Institute and later of the Kochs’ Americans For Prosperity (AFP), which then subsequently created the ’Tea Party’ in 2002. So: Andrei Illarionov’s view is rooted deeper in the history of libertarianiam, and is also more strongly related to the money-base of the Republican Party, than is Ron Paul’s.\nThe Kochs did not fund the political career of either Ron Paul or Rand Paul. However, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a member of the Bilderberg Steering Committee, donated $2.6 million to Ron Paul’s 2012 campaign, which is probably the biggest donation to the campaign.\nThese are among the indications that persuade me that, though the Pauls would obviously have liked to have gotten the aristocracy’s support, they never really managed to. The Politico article even says that Rand Paul’s casual manner and style of dress were turn-offs to the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends. However, the Kochs’ friends are mainly from old-line Texas and Midwestern money, largely from energy and financial industries. By contrast, Ron Paul’s chief backer, Peter Thiel, is a California technology entrepreneur, and co-founder of PayPal. He also is first-generation wealth, whereas the Kochs are second-generation wealth, and, really, third-generation wealth if the newspaper publisher who was Fred Koch’s father Harry Koch is counted to have founded that dynasty.\nLibertarianism is rooted in the aristocracy, and especially in inherited wealth. The Pauls, with their emphases upon “ending the Fed,” and also opposing the military-industrial complex that supports every empire (and thus the national aristocracy), mix libertarianism with a populist tradition that is at the far-opposite end of the ideological spectrum, basically progressive, not at all conservative (of either the libertarian or any other variety).\nLibertarians’ civil war over Ukraine is a reflection of the difference between libertarianism’s populist base or consumers (which the Pauls rely upon) versus libertrianism’s elite source and manufacturerers (which produced and market the ideology, and so have actually created and politically exploited that base). It’s like the difference between a manufacturer and a consumer. While the Pauls sell to the consumers, the Kochs have been the main manufacturers during the past forty years.\nOne of the aristocracy’s Republican fronts, “The Foreign Policy Initiative,” produced on 12 February",
        "baseline": " 2015, an article “The Libertarian Civil War Over Ukraine,” which portrays Ron Paul as “regurgitating [Russian] propaganda” on Ukraine. It attacks Paul not from a libertarian perspective, but from a mainstream conservative, nationaliist, one. To judge from the reader comments to it at the Democratic Party site The Daily Beast, which is a liberal front for the aristocracy, that line of propaganda works at ‘both’ ends of American politics, perhaps because a ‘Democratic’ President happens to have done the coup and installed the nazis into power in Ukraine. There is virtual unity regarding the way that American ‘news’ media have been handling the issue of Ukraine. The only differences are in how the policy is being marketed. The Pauls are trying to sell a different policy on the entire Russia matter, but they don’t control the ‘news’ media; and, so, theirs is only a niche market.",

We go right now to John Hamilton of KPFA.\nJOHN HAMILTON: The Port of Oakland is among the world’s busiest, moving thousands of shipping containers on a normal day. But Wednesday in Oakland was anything but normal. By 5:00 p.m., a crowd, that police estimated at several thousand and which protesters said was far higher, swamped the entrances to the port and idled trade. It capped an extraordinary day of actions that followed Occupy Oakland’s call for a general strike.\nKAT BROOKS: I’ve heard ranges from 20,000 all the way up to 100,000 people were here. All I know is that when I hit the hill for the bridge, I looked back, and all I could see was floods and floods and floods and floods of people chanting and marching. We took over three gates that we found that were going to be working today. We stayed there until the arbitrator came. And in all three cases, the arbitrator said that it was an unsafe place for the workers to enter. And from what I understand, though we’ve gotten mixed reports, the workers were sent home with pay, which is a huge victory, because, of course, we don’t want anybody to lose a day’s pay in today’s economy.\nJOHN HAMILTON: The day of action began early Wednesday morning at the Occupy Oakland encampment in Frank Ogawa Plaza, an area renamed by protesters after Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old man shot to death by a transit officer on New Year’s Day 2009. Kicking off the day of action was a famous author, activist and scholar.\nANGELA DAVIS: My name is Angela Davis. It is an honor to be with you today, as we demonstrate to the government of the city of Oakland that we do not assent to police violence, that we stand in defense of Scott Olsen and the memory of Oscar Grant. We do assent to community, to education, to free education, to healthcare, to free healthcare, to housing, to happiness, to justice, to creativity, to hope for the future.\nPROTESTERS: We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent!\nJOHN HAMILTON: By 9:00 a.m., a crowd of thousands had flooded downtown Oakland, their ranks swelled by union members.\nKIMBERLY ROJAS: My name is Kimberly Rojas, and I’m the Oakland president of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union. And I’m out here on a day of action supporting the general strike. The postal workers are 99 percent. We’re under attack with all workers around the world. And it’s time to rise up and start a new day.\nJOHN HAMILTON: While no labor group explicitly endorsed the general strike, unions including the SEIU, the longshoremen’s union and the Oakland Education Association backed a day of action in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement. Steve Neat is an officer with the Oakland teachers’ union.\nSTEVE NEAT: We know that there’s hundreds of teachers participating today. There’s four schools right now that have pretty much shut down for the day. There’s other schools where some of the staff have gone. We know",

And I came here again today to support the occupation. My sign says, “Bail out the schools, not the banks.” OUSD is a struggling district. I currently have 24 children in my classroom. They’re closing down five public schools next year. That means we’re going to have a huge influx of students. It can be up to 27 in the classrooms. This is not feasible to meet the needs of our youth. We’re really setting our kids up to fail. There’s a school-to-prison pipeline, and I see it happening. I see it happening under these conditions.\nAMY GOODMAN: That report from Oakland filed by John Hamilton.",

        "prompt": "Republican businessman Larry Hogan pulled off a stunning upset in heavily Democratic Maryland on Tuesday, winning the governor’s race against Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown by relentlessly promising to roll back tax increases and chart a new direction for the state.\nShortly after midnight, Brown conceded a race that he lost despite the strong support of the state’s Democratic establishment and visits to Maryland in the closing weeks of the campaign by President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nHogan’s victory — a repudiation of the eight-year tenure of Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) — means that Annapolis will return to divided government for the first time since 2006. It remains to be seen how much Hogan and his running mate, Lt. Gov.-elect Boyd Rutherford, will be able to accomplish with a Democratic-controlled legislature. Their victory sent a strong message that Marylanders had grown weary of the tax increases enacted under O’Malley, which Hogan harped on throughout the campaign.\nHogan said he received “a very gracious call” from Brown, and he asked his supporters to give a round of applause to the lieutenant governor and to O’Malley. Instead, they chanted, “Larry! Larry! Larry!” Hogan also said he received a phone call from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who visited Maryland four times on his behalf.\nHogan, the owner of an Anne Arundel County real estate business, had argued that electing Brown would be tantamount to giving O’Malley a third term. Touting his private-sector negotiating skills, Hogan has pledged to do more to work with Democratic legislative leaders than the state’s previous GOP governor, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., who had an acrimonious four years in Annapolis.\nWith more than 90 percent of precincts reporting, Brown was winning handily in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, and he was well ahead in the city of Baltimore. But turnout appeared fairly low in those populous jurisdictions. And Hogan led everywhere else, including in the Baltimore suburbs. That was the region that in 2002 paved the way to victory for Ehrlich, who hired Hogan as a member of his Cabinet.\nBrown, the son of a Jamaican father and a Swiss mother, was attempting to become the first African American governor of Maryland and only the third elected anywhere in the nation. He would also have been Maryland’s first lieutenant governor to ascend to the state’s top job.\nInstead, he faced some of the same difficulties as other deputies who have sought a promotion from voters. After spending eight years in the shadows, he struggled to distinguish himself from O’Malley and provide a rationale for his election.\nRather than offering voters a strong vision for what he would do in office, Brown focused much of his campaign on telling the public that Hogan had a “dangerous” agenda, particularly on social issues.\nHogan attracted enough Democratic votes to prevail in a state where Republicans are outnumbered more than 2-to-1 in party registration. And he did so despite being outspent by Brown. Hogan is the first candidate elected governor after opting into the state’s public financing system, which limited direct spending by his campaign to about $2.6 million during the general election — about half of what Brown raised.\nBoth campaigns benefited from millions in spending by the state parties and partisan groups working to elect governors nationwide. In an appearance at a rally Sunday night in Baltimore, Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, predicted that Hogan would pull off the biggest upset in the country Tuesday.\nMany voters interviewed at the polls seemed to be enduring, rather than enjoying, the election, often showing more interest in defeating one of the nominees than in helping the other to victory.\nBrown supporters, in many cases, expressed satisfaction with O’Malley, while supporters of Hogan were harshly critical, saying they want a different direction for the state.\n“I think we need somebody that will really focus on, ‘What can I do for Maryland to lower the unemployment rate, to raise the salaries?’ ” said Maria De La Cruz Magowan, 49, an economist from Bethesda.\nAt a Rockville polling place, Larry Ingram, 73, a businessman and registered independent, said Maryland’s taxes are too high, that the state should have a higher standard of living and that he doesn’t want to see businesses leave the state. He voted for Hogan.\nIn other races, Sen. Brian E. Frosh (D-Montgomery) easily defeated Republican Jeffrey N. Pritzker, a Towson lawyer, in the race to become Maryland’s next attorney general. Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) handily won another term, beating Republican challenger William H. Campbell.\nSeven of Maryland’s eight congressional incumbents won their bids for another term by wide margins: Republican Andy Harris and Democrats Chris Van Hollen, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Donna F. Edwards, Steny H. Hoyer and Elijah E. Cummings.\nWith most precincts reporting in the 6th District, first-term Rep. John Delaney (D) had a narrow lead over Republican Daniel Bongino, a former Secret Service agent.\nMontgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) and Prince George’s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) won their bids to secure another term. Every seat in the state Senate and House of Delegates was also up for election.\nVoters passed a measure creating a “lockbox” for state transportation funding, but Prince George’s voters narrowly defeated a proposal to limit County Council members and the county executive to three terms in office rather than two.\nIn Baltimore County, Jessica Baldwin, 27, said she voted for Hogan because it had become increasingly difficult for her friends to find well-paying work. Taxes, she said, have become too much. “You don’t see a return from it a lot of the time,” she said.\nHogan promised throughout his campaign to roll back as many as possible of the tax increases enacted under O’Malley — 40 by his count.\nBrown did not campaign heavily on racial themes. But in the closing weeks of the contest, Democrats reminded African American voters of the historic nature of his campaign, sending mailers that included both painful and inspiring scenes from the civil rights era.\nBoth campaigns went negative from the outset. On the day after his primary win, Hogan released a Web ad calling Brown “the most incompetent man in Maryland.” It was a reference, in part, to Brown’s role in the state’s botched rollout of the online health insurance marketplace established under the federal Affordable Care Act.\nBrown, meanwhile, launched a barrage of television ads assailing Hogan’s “agenda” for Maryland, including his positions on guns. One provocative ad showed an assault rifle resting against a swing set, highlighting Hogan’s opposition to a year-old gun control law that banned 45 types of those weapons and included new fingerprinting and registration requirements to own a handgun.\nHogan insisted that he had no plans to roll back the law, but the issue became",
        "baseline": " harder to deflect when the National Rifle Association endorsed him late in the campaign and awarded him a grade of A-minus on its issues, based in part on a questionnaire that Hogan refused to make public.\nEven on Election Day, several voters said they still didn’t know much about either of the major-party gubernatorial candidates or what they would do in office. A few complained about the barrage of negative television ads.\n“The candidates went about it as if it was a slug fight,” said Reginald Payne, 52, a liquor store manager who lives in Prince George’s and voted for Brown.\nDiana Zhou, 32, a federal contract worker from Bowie, said she was going to vote for Hogan, but she studied his Web site and did not think his action plan was comprehensive. She voted for Brown, although she was not completely sold on him.\n“I’m not a fan of either one,” Zhou said.",

PIC: Contributed.\nTheir last violent encounter is remembered for its classic downhill Highland charge and the use of the feared Lochaber axe.\nAround 1,500 men gathered at Maol Ruadh near Spean Bridge for the battle with the MacDonalds of Keppoch raising around 700 fighters which included back up from the Camerons of Lochiel and the MacMartins of Letterfinlay.\nLeading the clan was Coll MacDonald, who had been studying at St Andrews University when he succeeded his father as chieftain six years earlier.\nMeanwhile, the Mackintoshes gathered around 1,000 men for the battle. This included fighters from its Clan Chattan allies and up to 500 government soldiers from the Independent Highland Companies that were brought down from Inverness.\nUnder dispute was a stretch of land at Keppoch with the hostilities intensifying after clan chief Lachlan Mackintosh ordered the construction of a fort on the site.\nThe law upheld the land as his - with a parchment from the Privy Council to prove it - but the MacDonalds of Keppoch lay claim given the clan system’s right of long occupancy, continued improvement and successful defence, according to accounts.\nAs the construction of the fort continued, Coll MacDonald’s forces gathered, shielded by the hills of Glen Roy, according to Historic Environment Scotland’s inventory of historic battlefields.\nAs men mobilised, Captain Mackenzie of Suddie was dispatched from Inverness to give government aid to Mackintosh so he could fight his enemies.\nFor at least a week, the two mounting forces were kept apart by the high waters of the River Spean and Roy.\nBut in the first week of August, the Mackintoshes crossed the rivers to find “their enemies arrayed on good ground on the slope of Maol Ruadh, according to the HES account of events.\nThe account added: “The MacDonalds and their allies, who were positioned on the high ground, executed a classic Highland charge down the slope towards the Mackintoshes.\n“While some accounts describe the MacDonalds discharging one volley before charging forward to meet their foes with drawn swords and Lochaber axes, another quite detailed account describes a fire-fight lasting for up to an hour.\nThe regular troops of Mackenzie’s force returned to their garrison at Inverness,",

We’ll let him get two innings under his belt to get re-acclimated to relieving.\nPlayers optioned to the minors typically must remain there for 10 days, but that doesn’t apply if their minor-league club completes its season.\nWilmington will conclude its regular season Monday and is on the verge of elimination from possible postseason play. Barring that miracle, Davis and Coleman will each return for Tuesday’s game against Seattle.\nClass AAA Omaha and Class AA Northwest Arkansas also conclude their regular seasons Monday but both remain alive in the postseason hunt.\nThe Royals recalled Duffy from Omaha to replace an inconsistent Davis in their rotation for Wednesday’s game against the Twins at Target Field. Hochevar returned to active duty after three days of paternity leave.\nRules permit clubs to expand their rosters from 25 players to a maximum of 40 on Sept. 1 (Sunday), but the rules governing the recall of players optioned to the minors remain in effect.\nYost said the Royals are likely to make additions before Sunday’s series finale at Toronto. He cited a third catcher, to join Salvy Perez and George Kottaras, as one priority.\nThird baseman Mike Moustakas returned to the bench for Wednesday’s game after missing the series opener Tuesday while battling strep throat in addition to continuing to nurse a strained left calf muscle.\nMoustakas isn’t likely to start in Thursday’s series finale against the Twins, when temperatures are expected to reach the mid-90s, but he could return to the lineup for Friday’s series opener in Toronto.\nMoustakas said he hadn’t slept in four days. He began experiencing symptoms during Sunday’s victory over Washington but said his condition deteriorated in Monday’s victory over Tampa Bay.\nMoustakas remained in his hotel room Tuesday until near game time, when he went to Target Field for further evaluation and treatment.\nOutfielder Justin Maxwell underwent precaution X-rays on his right hand after getting hit by a pitch from Twins reliever Anthony Swarzak in the ninth inning.\nThe results show no broken bones, which left Maxwell with a smile.\nMaxwell suffered a broken left hand April 23, while playing for Houston, when hit by a pitch from Seattle’s Hisashi Iwakuma. Maxwell didn’t return until June 18.\nThe Royals reclaimed the American League lead in team ERA after Tuesday’s 6-1 victory over the Twins lowered their mark to 3.541 — just ahead of Detroit’s 3.543.\nOnly once have the Royals led the league in ERA: 1976, with a 3.21 mark.\nAlso, the Royals’ bullpen ERA of 2.58 leads the league and is on pace to be the best mark by an AL relief corps since Oakland’s 2.35 ERA in 1990.\nThey won two home games — 6-4 over Washington on Sunday and 11-1 over Tampa Bay in a makeup for a May 2 snow-out — before beating Minnesota 6-1 on Tuesday in the series opener at Target Field.\nThat’s rare but not unprecedented. It also happened on two previous occasions (thanks to research by the Elias Sports Bureau).\nFrom May 6-8, 1990, the Royals beat Chicago in a home game before winning at Cleveland and Texas. During Aug. 27-29, 1995, they won home games against Texas and Milwaukee while sandwiching in a victory at New York.\nIf you’re the type who likes to pop for a cold brew or two at the ballpark, know that prices at Kauffman Stadium are pretty much at the major-league average in a study conducted by Team Marketing Report.\nThe survey calculated the average price per ounce of beer at all 30 ballparks and found Kauffman Stadium ranked 15th at 41 cents.\nThe most expensive was Fenway Park in Boston at 60 cents, followed by Busch Stadium in St. Louis at 56 cents. The Skydome in Toronto and Nationals Park in Washington tied for third at 52 cents.\nThe majors’ cheapest buzz is found at Angel Stadium in Anaheim: 28 cents.\nThe Royals are closing out their most successful year ever against the Twins after improving 14-4 with Wednesday’s victory. The two teams conclude their season series with a game Thursday afternoon.\nThe 1975 and 2003 Royals each posted 11 victories over the Twins, going 11-7 and 11-8. That 2003 team was also the last one to win a season series against Minnesota.\nThe Royals are 33-26 against AL Central opponents with 18 games remaining.\nRight-hander Angel Baez, who is heading to the Arizona Fall League, pitched six scoreless innings Tuesday night for Class A Wilmington in a 5-2 victory over Myrtle Beach.\nBaez, 22, yielded just one hit while striking out five and walking four.

It was the way Callow sought to live his life as he raised a family and rose to become a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nCallow died March 6 at AngelsGrace Hospice in Oconomowoc. He was 96.\n\"He considered his role as judge to be more than just presiding at trials and court hearings,\" said his son, Grant Callow. \"For that reason, he felt it was important to reach out to the public and let them know what it was like to be a judge and to help them understand the law and how the law worked.\"\nCallow won his seat on the Supreme Court in 1977, was re-elected in 1987 and retired from the court in 1992.\nPatience Roggensack, the court's chief justice, saluted Callow as \"a lawyer and judge whose passion for the law was driven by a superior intellect and strong conviction.\"\n\"Generous and warm, he was known to be feisty and intense when a question of law needed answering,\" Roggensack said in a statement. \"I knew a man of honor and commitment who never lost his sense of humor in the gravest of situations.\"\nBorn in Waukesha, Callow survived scarlet fever as a child, and after the death of his mother, lived for a time with his maternal grandparents, aunts and uncles on a farm in Platteville.\nAfter his father remarried, Callow returned to Waukesha when he was 8. A 1943 graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, he served as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps during World War II. He later served stateside in the military during the Korean War.\nBy then, he was already an attorney after graduating from UW Law School in 1948.\nHe met his future wife, Jean Zilavy, at a local Red Cross in Waukesha. They were married 68 years and raised three children.\nAccording to his biography in the Wisconsin Court System, Callow served as city attorney in Waukesha from 1952 to 1960 and served 16 years as a judge for Waukesha County Circuit Court, winning three elections between 1961 and 1973.\n\"As a trial judge, Callow pioneered group therapy for drunk drivers and victim/offender reconciliation in property crime,\" his biography said.\nHe also conducted hundreds of lectures at Wisconsin high schools across the state, explaining the ramifications of the law in such areas as teenage marriage and drunken driving. Later, he wrote a pamphlet, \"You and the Law,\"\nHis son recalled during Christmastime, Callow would distribute small gift bags",
        "baseline": " to those locked up in the local jail.\n\"He didn't like sentencing people, but he believed in the rule of law,\" his son said.\nRunning as a tough-talking law-and-order candidate, he defeated Milwaukee Circuit Judge Robert W. Landry in a hard-fought state Supreme Court race in 1977. A Milwaukee Sentinel article at the time likened him to a snowball, \"icy hard outside, but soft inside.\"\n\"When it came right down to it, he made a positive difference in the lives of a lot of people,\" his son said. \"You can hardly have a better epitaph than that.\"\nBesides his wife and son, Callow is survived by daughters Christine Vasquez and Katie Wilkie, two grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.\nA memorial gathering will be held from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. March 21 at Church and Chapel Funeral Home, 380 Blue Mound Road, Waukesha.",

July 1, 2 and 3 mark the 155th anniversary of that monumental Civil War battle. Minnesotans proudly recall the heroic service of our 1st Minnesota Regiment of volunteers in the final two days of that great contest, which at long last terminated offensive actions by the deadly Confederate Army of Northern Virginia for the rest of the war.\nSt. Paul contributed greatly to the composition of this famous regiment, supplying its first volunteer (Josias King), its first commander (Willis Gorman) and two full companies (A and C). So it is only fitting that Summit Park in St. Paul would possess a nationally exclusive living memento of that great battlefield.\nFifteen years ago, in the spring of 2003, while visiting Gettysburg, I was standing before the primary monument to the 1st Minnesota Infantry there on Cemetery Ridge. I noticed as the grounds crew drove a portion of its fleet of mowers across the ground in front of our monument — which included some annual red cedar sprouts — as part of its regular maintenance, attempting to preserve the field in its 1863 appearance. This was the very ground over which our regiment made its heroic and legendary charge to interrupt a Confederate advance. The Minnesotans would pay a shocking price in this 15-minute engagement, suffering 82 percent casualties.\nFederal law prohibits the removal of flora from a national park or battlefield by citizens. However, since these seedlings were a waste product to the park staff, which they eradicated annually, I hoped they would grant permission to allow collection of a few of them about to fall before their mower blades and permit donation to the city of St. Paul.\nAfter coordinating correspondence between the city and the national park for most of six months, the park allowed the donation if the city would send agents to harvest them under its direct supervision in the spring of 2004. My friends Greg Johnson and Perry Tholl, Civil War re-enactors with the 1st Minnesota Infantry, joined me, representing the city, in the collection of six 1-foot-tall red cedar seedlings.\nRed cedars are not native to our temperate zone, so the city placed them under the care and supervision of their talented staff at the Como Conservatory for the next four years. By 2008, they had reached a height of 3 feet and were transplanted, as planned, in a circle surrounding the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Summit Park across the street in front of the Cathedral.\nThe summers of 2008 and 2009 were dramatically dry and the survival of the",
        "baseline": " transplants was severely challenged. Only the purchase of water from a kind homeowner across the street, allowing generous watering through both summers, saved the lives of four of six trees. They are now healthy 12-footers that appear to have a bright future under the protection of the city Parks and Recreation Department.\nSt. Paul now has these gifts as living Civil War memorials, likely unique in the nation. While celebrating the anniversary of our country’s birth this July 4 holiday, perhaps take a few minutes to also recall the heroism and sacrifice of Minnesota’s 1st Civil War regiment in the Battle of Gettysburg on the three preceding days 155 years ago. A good way to do so might include a brief stop at Summit Park to see these trees that originated on the precise ground in Pennsylvania where a century and a half ago so many Minnesotans suffered and died to preserve our nation.\nThe author is a historic preservation activist and frequent writer on aspects of the Civil War.",

Hinckley went further ahead with two tries in as many minutes although Malvern were unhappy about the first of these - as they were with a lot of the referee’s decisions throughout- as they thought there had been an infringement before Greasley crossed again in the 55th minute.\nStraight from the restart, the kick was collected and Blain Bonin-Ward completed the scoring with the visitors’ third try.\nHinckley had two players sin-binned late on and their defence had to counter wave after wave of attacks but held out in a frantic final 10 minutes.",

        "prompt": "A new review of face recognition software found that, when identifying gender, the software is most accurate for men with light skin and least accurate for women with dark skin. Joy Buolamwini, an MIT Media Lab researcher and computer scientist, tested three commercial gender classifiers offered as part of face recognition services. As she found, the software misidentified the gender of dark-skinned females 35 percent of the time. By contrast, the error rate rate for light-skinned males was less than one percent.\nThe results mirror previous findings about the failures of face recognition software when identifying women and individuals with darker skin. As noted by Georgetown University’s Center for Privacy and Technology, these gender and racial disparities could, in the context of airport facial scans, make women and minorities more likely to be targeted for more invasive processing like manual fingerprinting.\nAll face recognition software is trained by scanning thousands upon thousands of images in a dataset, refining its ability to extract valuable datapoints and ignore what isn’t useful. As Buolamwini notes, many of these datasets are themselves biased. Adience, one gender classification benchmark, uses subjects that are 86 percent light-skinned. Another dataset, IJB-A, uses subjects that are 79 percent light-skinned.\nAmong other problems with skewed datasets, they allow companies to call their face recognition software “accurate,” when really they’re only accurate for people similar to those in the dataset: mostly men, mostly lighter. Darker women were least represented in these data sets. 7.4 percent of the Adiance dataset were dark-skinned women, while IJB-A was 4.4 percent. This becomes a problem when companies rely on them.\nBuolamwini tested three commercial software APIs: Microsoft’s Cognitive Services Face API, IBM’s Watson Visual Recognition API, and Face++, a Chinese computer vision company that’s provided tech for Lenovo. Buolamwini tested to see if each could reliably classify the gender of the person in each photo.\nAs she found, all classifiers performed better on male faces than female faces and all classifiers were least accurate when determining the gender of dark-skinned females. Face++",
        "baseline": " and IBM had a classification error rate of 34.5 and 34.7 percent, respectively, on dark-skinned women. Both had light-skinned male error rates of less than one percent. Microsoft’s dark-skinned female error rate was 20.8 percent and effectively zero for light-skinned males.\nBuolamwini hopes for parity in face recognition accuracy, particularly as face recognition software has become standardized in law enforcement and counterterrorism. Passengers are scanned in airports, spectators are scanned in arenas, and, in the age of iPhone X, everyone may soon be scanned by their phones. Buolamwini cites the Georgetown study, warning that as face recognition becomes standard in airports, and those who “fail” the test receive extra scrutiny, a potential feedback loop of bias could develop. In the paper, she hopes the field will embrace even more intersectional audits that look at disproportionate impacts, particularly as AI is poised to become a core part of our society.",
        "llm_baseline": "Google’s API was the most accurate,with an error rate of just.13 percent.Microsoft’s API was the least accurate,with an error rate of just.13 percent.IBM’s API was in the middle,with an error rate of 24 percent and an error rate of 7 percent.The results are also similar to those found by the Georgetown University Center for Privacy and Security.In 2016,the center found that facial recognition software was most accurate for light-skinned men and least accurate for dark-skinned women.The center’s report found that the error rate for light-skinned men was 0 percent,the error rate for dark-skinned women was 75 percent,and the error rate for dark-skinned women was 35 percent and the error rate for light-skinned men was 4 percent.The results are also similar to those found by the National Institute of Standards and Technology(theNIST).In 2015,the center found that facial recognition software was most accurate for light-skinned men and least accurate for dark-skinned women.The center’s report found that the error rate for light-skinned men",

        "prompt": "New Zealand is not typically considered a major colonial power, but the country’s recent defense policy statement revealed hidden aspirations of expansion in one geostrategic area in particular: Antarctica.\nEvery year, the New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) supposedly deploys personnel and aircraft to the continent with the aim of helping to “advance globally important research.” Mark made the remarks while unveiling the 2018 Defense Policy Statement in Wellington last July.\nIn fact, New Zealand troops have been serving in Antarctica for decades. Some personnel now fear they may have cancer due to an American nuclear power plant at McMurdo Station, which began to leak, killing US servicemen some time later. New Zealand troops continue to serve in McMurdo Station to this day, which is the hub of United States’ scientific activity in Antarctica, playing host to more than 1,000 scientists and support personnel during the summer season. Earlier this year, most experienced NZDF drivers headed to Antarctica to haul 12 months of supplies, construction material, scientific equipment, vehicles, general supplies, and maintenance equipment.\nI wonder how many of you would expect a New Zealand Defense Policy Statement to even mention Antarctica, let alone devise an entire strategy on how to contain the continent for itself.\n“It is a fundamental responsibility of the New Zealand government to protect New Zealand’s people, prosperity, territory, sovereignty and resources; uphold New Zealand’s constitutional obligations to the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau; and maintain New Zealand’s claim to territorial sovereignty in the Ross Dependency of Antarctica,” the Policy Statement reads, reiterating the 2016 White Paper in slightly different terms.\nAccording to the Policy Statement, “international interest” in Antarctica is growing, therefore it will be critical for New Zealand to ensure peace and stability on its southern flank and in its very own Ross Dependency. New Zealand also has a “direct interest in stability on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean,” the report states, because, as you undoubtedly know, Antarctica is well known as a hotbed of instability, insecurity and terrorism, right behind Iraq and Syria. New Zealand also sees itself as playing a vital role in providing “awareness” and advocating “for transparency of all parties’ activities” in Antarctica, clearly fearing that other countries may contest its standing there.\nThose of you paying attention probably have a fair idea of where this is headed. As I have warned previously, the defense document itself essentially sets the stage for a confrontation with China, though the media will never tell you that. So, where does Antarctica fit into New Zealand’s geopolitical struggle with China’s expanding influence in the Pacific region?\nIn August last year, a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warned that Australia’s leadership role was being eroded because of long-term under-investment at a time when other countries (read: China) were expanding their influence in the Pacific region. The report went on to warn that “China has conducted undeclared military activities in Antarctica, is building up a case for a territorial claim, and is engaging in minerals exploration there.” According to the report, three out of four of China’s Antarctic bases and two of its field camps are in the Australian Antarctic Territory, further warning that China’s presence there is aimed at competing for resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons, fishing, tourism, transport routes, water and bioprospecting.\nThe report stated that China’s military activities in Antarctica have the potential to shift the strategic balance that has maintained peace in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Antarctica, for nearly 70 years.\nThe author of this report, Professor Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury, released a separate report specific to the New Zealand context, which warned that “New Zealand must rethink its assessment of risk in Antarctica and devise a strategy to protect its interests there.” Bear in mind, however, that this report was released at a time when the New Zealand government’s Defense Policy defined China as a “key strategic partner” for New Zealand. The 2018 Policy Statement makes no such reference – a clear indication that China is now to be viewed as a potential adversary.\nI mean, there must be a reason why the New Zealand Air Force has been training for a potential Antarctic crash that may result in an aircraft going down in enemy territory. Enemy territory? What enemies should we expect to find on an entire continent of ice, widely described as the world’s largest desert. To the New Zealand government and the rest of the powers who have Antarctica in their sights, it is anything but a large block of ice.\nAntarctica has huge potential economic value, particularly regarding its mineral and oil resources. New Zealand knows this, the United States knows this. Hell, even South Korea knows this. The Ross Sea – to which New Zealand has a pending claim of its own – is suspected of possessing one of the world’s largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. The Ross Depend",
        "baseline": "ency contains a land area that could fit New Zealand’s entire country in at least three times over. It is the most important access point to the continent, including access to the Ross Sea. New Zealand is not going to give up this strategic area so easily, as one would expect.\nNew Zealand, on the other hand, may find itself struggling to compete with China in this regard. It may have the upper hand for the time being, given its military has been involved in Antarctica for over 50 years and has a claim to at least 15 percent of the territory. However, this is the first time that New Zealand has openly treated China as an adversary in a national defense document signed off by all of New Zealand’s government ministries, indicating that we may be witnessing an overt geopolitical shift in alliances as countries begin to assert their competing claims over geostrategic areas in plain view, all the while the media insists on talking about Donald Trump, Russia, and not much else.",

Jack Morris of the Enid Police Department said, according to KFOR.\nThe community started getting suspicious about the child's condition after Jessica claimed her daughter went through chemotherapy, but the \"patient\" never lost a single hair or looked like she was ailing.\nAlan Seibel, an associate pastor of Oakwood Christian Church, reported the fraud to police in July, after the church had given more than $5,000 to the family for mortgage payments and medical expenses, the Enid News reported.\nJessica had allegedly lied to the church, telling its members her daughter had cancer, suffered from seizures, was going",

Steyning trail leaders Alfold on goal difference having played an extra match.\nIn front of a big crowd of 243, the game started brightly with both teams keen to go on the attack. Bexhill settled down on the ball quite well and passed it around impressively.\nThere were a couple of half-chances at either end early on, with Andy Atkin firing over for Bexhill, while a Steyning player appeared fortunate to escape without at least a booking for a bad tackle on Jack McLean.\nMcLean picked himself up to provide the assist for the game’s opening goal, flicking the ball inside to Jack Shonk, who struck a tremendous shot from 20 yards which flew over the goalkeeper and into the net.\nBexhill came under a bit of pressure after that, but weathered it and Atkin - making his first appearance since recently dual registering for the Pirates with Bexhill Town - was causing all kind of problems with his physicality.\nAtkin had a hand in Bexhill’s second goal, flicking the ball past the last defender before being scythed down. The resulting free kick was delivered to the far post, where it was flicked on by a Steyning head, and Liam Foster drove the ball under the goalkeeper from a tight angle.\nThinking a third goal could kill the game off, Bexhill were eager to start the second half on the front foot. Instead, however, Steyning put them on the back foot with some high tempo, good quality football and Bexhill struggled to get out of their half at times.\nA key moment in the contest came when Steyning pulled one back via an Alfie Grant penalty after Bexhill defender Lewis McGuigan was controversially penalised for handball.\nThe ball seemed to strike McGuigan on the back of the elbow with his arms tucked in by his side. With the benefit of having watched a video of the incident, Light said ‘never in a million years’ should a spot-kick have been awarded.\nLight then dropped Atkin into a back three as a sweeper in a bid to combat Steyning’s attacking threat. And the move seemed to work a treat as Atkin won everything in the air and Steyning appeared to start running out of ideas.\nAtkin then slipped, however, and suffered a hamstring injury which forced him off, despite his best efforts to continue.\nBexhill reverted to their usual back four and Steyning scored an 87th minute equaliser which Light was convinced wouldn’t have happened had Atkin still been on the pitch.\nThe ball",

Swalla pulled within one with an escape, then with 17 seconds left, made a move near the edge that nearly gave him two points and the lead.\nBut Noftsger fended Swalla off with a nice counter move.\nNoftsger held on over the final seconds for a 4-3 victory to take a 35-1 record into his fourth state tournament. The two tough battles against Swalla were great tests for Noftsger as he aims for a state championship next week at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.\nSwalla beat Webster City's Sean Godfredsen by a 14-2 major decision in a wrestleback to take a 35-5 record into state.\nBallard had two other wrestlers qualify for state — Gage Long at 132 and Joe Hofbauer at 195. They each placed second.\nThe Bombers had seven wrestlers advance to districts, but three came up short in a wrestleback and another - 120-pounder Reese Broer - was ill and couldn't compete.\nLong pulled off a 6-2 decision over Gilbert's Jake Shedarowich then lost by an 8-4 decision to Perry's Jacob Nelson in the finals. Long came back to edge Van Meter-Earlham's Tyler Haynes by a 2-1 decision in a wrestleback to make state for the first time with a 36-12 record.\nHofbauer (26-3) is also headed to Des Moines for the first time. He earned an 11-5 victory over Gilbert's Jacob Steenhoek then lost in the finals to No. 5 Caleb Olson of Webster City by fall.\nAlex Bangs (138), Jim Chism (170) and Mason Askelsen (182) were the three Bombers that placed third.\nGilbert also moved three of its seven wrestlers to state.\nCarson Johnson (152) and Aiden Carr (170) each won a district title and Cael Ihle came in second at 126. Three Tigers - Steenhoek, Cayden Mesken (220) and Jacob Torresi (285) place third and Shedarowich finished fourth.\nLike Noftsger, Johnson gained some big revenge at districts. After pinning Van Meter-Earlham's Bryce Cole in the semifinals Johnson knocked off Perry's Justin Stammer by a 5-2 decision in the finals after Stammer defeated him at sectionals.\nThe single-leg takedown was Johnson's top move in the rematch with Stammer. He hit the single-leg twice and scored a takedown each time.\nJohnson is headed to Des Moines with a 42-7 record.\nCarr pinned Van Meter-Earlham's Sam Miller in 3:01 during the semifinals. In the finals he knocked off Chism by a 7-3 score to take a 42-6 record into state.\nIhle pinned Earlham's Korbin Barck in 1:30 during the semifinals then lost by a 14-4 major decision to top-ranked and undefeated Andrew Flora of Adel-Desoto-Minburn. Ihle was forced to go up against Webster City's Rattenborg in a wrestleback and after falling behind early he scored a fall in 2:52 to improve his record to 35-5.\nRoland-Story is sending two wrestlers to state in senior Koby Hassebrock (145) and junior Joe Hovick (113). Hassebrock is returning to the big stage and Hovick qualified for the first time.\nHassebrock, ranked seventh in 2A, is 38-3 heading into state. At districts he defeated Saydel's Jake Van Houten by technical fall, 16-0, then edged Van Meter-Earlham's Quinn Corcoran by a 4-2 decision in the finals.\nHovick (33-11) edged Woodward-Granger's Aidan Honkomp by a 1-0 decision in the semifinals then lost by a 12-0 major decision to Van Meter-Earlham's Zane Dodson. The loss to Dodson put Hovick in a wrestleback, where he toppled Perry's Riece Graham by a 9-4 decision to punch his ticket to state.\nReynaldo Torres (138) and Michael Schiermeister (285) each came in fourth for the Norsemen.\nThe state tournament will be Thursday through Saturday at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.

Now, Microsoft is laying out the similarities and differences between their respective clouds with, helping customers plan their cross-cloud environments and migrations.\nWhile the map provides a convenient new tool for current and potential customers, it also help Microsoft step up the marketing competition with AWS, which is by far the larger cloud platform.\nIt's not uncommon for businesses to rely on more than one provider for their cloud needs, as it turns out.\nPublished in February, RightScale's 2017 State of the Cloud Report discovered that enterprises are running their applications on 1.8 public clouds and experimenting with another 1.8 public clouds, on average. The study found that 85 percent of the 1,002 IT professionals said their organizations have a multi-cloud strategy in place.\nThe AWS-Azure cloud services comparison map between AWS and Azure may make the job of navigating those strategies a little easier.\n\"Whether you are planning a multi-cloud solution with Azure and AWS, or simply migrating to Azure, you will be able to use this service map to quickly orient yourself with the services required for a successful migration,\" wrote Michael Crump, a technical product manager at Microsoft Azure, in an Oct. 16 blog post. \"You can use the service map side-by-side with other useful resources found in our documentation.\"\nThe guide (PDF) covers 13 categories, including compute, storage, database, big data and many others. As fierce cloud competitors, both companies cover a lot of the same ground. In some cases, Azure offers a solution that AWS doesn't, like the DevTest Labs app-testing service. On the other hand, Amazon's GameLift and Lumberyard cloud-based game development tools don't have Azure equivalents.\nAt least one major customer seems pleased with Microsoft's cloud portfolio as-is.\nSecurity software vendor Symantec announced that it had selected Microsoft Azure to deliver its Norton consumer services to its 50 million customers.

        "prompt": "LONDON—Morgan Rielly is getting closer to achieving his dream.\nGiven an unexpected layover in London with his Team Canada junior teammates, simply getting back to Moose Jaw, Sask., from remote Ufa, Russia, on just a few hours’ sleep — a journey that could span three days — seemed a lofty goal.\nBut the one he’s been thinking about for a while now — playing for the Maple Leafs — is close at hand after Sunday’s tentative deal to end the NHL lockout.\nLeafs GM Brian Burke, who had a different travel itinerary, said last week in Ufa that Rielly and Soo Greyhounds forward David Broll would be the two junior players invited to training camp, expected to open later this week.\nIn Rielly’s case, Burke said his preference is to have the 18-year-old return to Moose Jaw and finish the season. But he added coach Randy Carlyle will pick the team, and if Carlyle wants Rielly — the team’s first-round pick this past summer — Burke won’t stand in the way.\nWith the Leafs, Rielly would likely rank behind Jake Gardiner — who has been out of the Marlies lineup with concussion symptoms — but there has been an opening on defence since the trade of Luke Schenn to the Flyers for forward James van Riemsdyk.\nRielly is Moose Jaw’s top defenceman, blessed with speed and the ability to make a good pass. He likes to carry the puck and models himself after Bobby Orr. He likes to wear No. 4 for that reason. With Team Canada, he played a more defensive style and far fewer minutes than he was used to, until coach Steve Spott took the reins off in search of offence in the semifinal and bronze-medal games.\n“Any time a player comes to play for Team Canada, everyone understands you have to change your role a little bit and change how you play to an extent,” said Rielly.\nFor the moment, Rielly is more worried about getting home. Since waking up Saturday, few on Team Canada got much in the way of rest. After their bronze-medal game, they waited for the Americans and shared an overnight charter to Helsinki with the Finns.\nThen they flew to London. Once in Toronto, they were to disperse. In Rielly’s case, he was to fly to Regina, then drive to Moose Jaw.\nWord that the NHL lockout had ended spread quickly among Team Canada’s players and brightened their bleak travel day. It happened shortly after they found out their noon flight from London’s Heathrow Airport had become a midnight flight. Air Canada put stranded",
        "baseline": " passengers into airport hotels for the day.\nClearly exhausted after their travel, and frustrated by delays that would see them — at best — getting back home in the wee hours of Monday morning, some perked up at the news they would soon be in long-awaited NHL camps.\nSome gathered around computers — that required pound coins for payment — to learn the details of the pending contract.\n“I guess that’s not bad,” said Rielly, referring to the salary cap at seven years for free agents.\nRielly will join the Leafs’ camp. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins will return to the Edmonton Oilers.\nAmong the others: Subban and Dougie Hamilton will skate with the Bruins; Mark Scheifele joins the Winnipeg Jets; Jonathan Huberdeau will be with the Florida Panthers; Ryan Murphy with the Carolina Hurricanes. Scott Harrington at Pittsburgh Penguins camp; and Griffin Reinhart and Ryan Strome with the New York Islanders.",

        "prompt": "SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. (Reuters) - Officials found themselves in a firestorm of criticism for opting not to disqualify Phil Mickelson after the five-times major champion deliberately hit a moving ball during the third round of the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills on Saturday.\nThe incident happened on the 13th green in what the American said was a deliberate action to “take advantage of the rules” — a comment that did not sit well with some former players.\nThe controversial moment occurred after Mickelson missed a short downhill putt and his ball continued to trickle away from the cup, aided by both gravity and a strong tailwind.\nRather than waiting for it to stop, he broke into a trot and when the ball was about 15 feet below the cup, and still in motion, he hit it back up the slope and it came to rest above the hole.\nMickelson, who is well out of contention for victory, said he knew the action would bring a two-shot penalty, and that he had hit the ball to prevent it from rolling all the way off the green and behind a bunker.\n“I didn’t feel like going back and forth,” he told reporters. “I would do it again. I wanted to get to the next hole and I didn’t see that happening at the time without the two shots.\nHitting a moving ball incurs a two-stroke penalty, and Mickelson was eventually assessed with a six-over 10 at the par-four hole.\nHe could have been disqualified had officials deemed it a serious breach of another rule that states “a player must not take an action with the intent to influence the movement of a ball in play”.\nHowever, U.S. Golf Association rules chief John Bodenhamer said Mickelson’s violation did not reach such a level.\nFormer PGA Tour winner Frank Nobilo was not impressed by the USGA decision.\n“To me it was quite straightforward. I think he should be disqualified,” New Zealander Nobilo said in his role as a Golf Channel analyst.\nFellow analyst Brandel Chamblee was similarly scathing.\n“This was Phil Mickelson disrespecting not only his position in the game, but also disrespecting the game,” he said.\nTelevision analysts on the live coverage were stunned.\n“John Daly’s reputation took a hit after what he did at Pinehurst in ‘99 and I fear it will be the same for Phil,” former U.S. Golf Association executive director David Fay said when comparing the incident with one from 19 years ago.\nMajor champions Curtis Strange and Paul Azinger were equally astonished.\n“I’ve never seen anything like that from a world class player in my life,” Strange added.\nAzinger was also not convinced by Mickelson’s explanation.\n“That’s good spin,” he said.\nAndrew Johnston, who was paired with Mickelson, was also in disbelief at the incident and broke into laughter, prompting the American to also grin as",
        "baseline": " the pair walked off the green.\n“I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s something you might see on your home course with your mates. It was just a moment of madness but nothing disrespectful,” the Briton said.\nThe incident on Mickelson’s 48th birthday brought to mind a similar episode by Daly during the 1999 U.S. Open when he swatted a moving ball in frustration after it rolled back toward him three times behind the back of the eighth green.\nThe flamboyant Daly, however, was already considered unpredictable, whereas Mickelson’s reputation as the golden man of American golf has been cultivated over almost three decades of exemplary behavior on the course.\nMickelson, who needs to win the U.S. Open to complete the career grand slam of all four majors, shot 81 for a 17-over 227 total as any hope of accomplishing the feat disappeared for another year.",
