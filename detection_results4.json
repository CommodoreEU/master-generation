        "prompt": "St. Paul-based West Side Community Health Services has a new name: Minnesota Community Care. Its role as a \"beacon of hope\" is the same.\nReuben Moore grew up a patient of community health centers and he now leads the state’s largest as CEO of St. Paul-based West Side Community Health Services.\nAs of Jan. 1, West Side has a new name: Minnesota Community Care. Its role as a “beacon of hope” is the same as it has been since its 1969 founding, Moore said.\nWith 400 employees and 17 locations, it serves 40,000 unique patients annually. Moore joined in October 2017, bringing nearly 20 years of health insurance and health care experience from Mayo Clinic, UnitedHealth Group, Humana and elsewhere.\nHe’s instituting Mayo-style team-based patient care at primary care sites, among other changes. Forty-three percent of Minnesota Community Care’s patients are uninsured, Moore said, although those with private insurance increasingly are visiting.\nQ: What is community health?\nA: Community health centers specialize in delivering localized primary-care services regardless of socioeconomic status. These services are tailored to the communities we serve. The value proposition is built upon high-quality clinical care that is affordable, comprehensive, culturally competent and complemented with enabling services that wrap around our patients to help reduce health access barriers and positively impact social determinants of health.\nQ: Where do patients travel from and why?\nA: They’re coming from all over: Michigan, Oklahoma, all over Minnesota, Wisconsin, North and South Dakota, Iowa. We’re probably the most affordable in terms of a sliding fee scale. Then there’s our cultural competency and legacy around serving diverse communities who have barriers to health access.\nQ: How do you work with insured patients?\nA: If you’re on commercial insurance and have a tough month we can move your bill down to where it’s affordable. Health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and it’s impacting more than just in the low-income brackets.\nQ: What services do your locations offer?\nA: Primary services, pharmacy, lab, radiology. Social workers, patient reps who can help get you enrolled in MNsure. Chiropractic. We have an ambulatory clinic. Specialty services: an HIV/AIDS clinic. Chronic-condition management. Emergency procedure rooms. Behavioral health and mental health. Nutritionists, community health workers, doulas. We carry probably the most interpreters for an organization our size: 17. We have 50-plus languages in the community. The billing department works with patients on affordability. You can get it all in a one-stop shop.\nQ: What changes are you making in addition to team-based care?\nA: We added a new site in downtown St. Paul. We intend to open a state-of-the art clinic in partnership with Catholic Charities in St. Paul. It will be the best for those with the least. I think that will be our future concept. We’re remodeling the La Clinica site [on St. Paul’s West Side]. We’re going to add more community health workers and health educators [in schools]. We had one mental health professional at each of our schools, and I said that’s not enough. So all of these things are being redeployed into our school-based clinics.\nQ: How challenging is it to get resources for new and expanded programs and locations?\nA: The economic challenges are intense. To provide the services to the community that the community needs we have to make trade-offs. Sometimes it requires us to be lean in other areas and cut costs in areas that are still important and hope that the reimbursement curve will catch up. But we are making those trade-offs today with the bet that we’ll improve in our patient experience and our volume tomorrow and be able to argue for a different way to be reimbursed in the future. It’s a risky bet, but we think we’re following the best clinical and evidence-based medicine and public health guidance.\nQ: What brought you to Minnesota Community Care?\nA: I wanted to get closer to care. It was somewhat serendipitous. I helped Mayo Clinic sell its health plan management company, which I was leading. In the same month of the deal closing, a recruiter reached out to me for this role.\nQ: What was your experience with community health care centers?\nA: I went to Washburn High School in Minneapolis. I hadn’t had dental care in maybe eight years or so, and my teeth had been hurting for two years. I",

I remember thinking, “I don’t have any money, I don’t have any insurance, I don’t have anything.” They said, “OK, we’ll help you,” and I got dental care. Thanks to community health centers I’ve still got great teeth.\nQ: What does the future hold for Minnesota Community Care?\nA: For 50 years, we have been an innovative leader in community-based, primary care services across our great state of Minnesota. For the next 50 years, we will continue this legacy by expanding our sites, improving our team-based care delivery model, partnering to better impact social determinants of health and relocating our brand as a beacon of community care, hope and healing for those in need of health care access.",

A group of young Muslim Shiites of Najaf attend Mass in the capital and have lunch with the patriarch. Several Baghdad streets festooned with Christmas trees.\nBaghdad (AsiaNews) - In Iraq we are witnessing \" grass roots revolt against terrorism, against violence\", accompanied by a renewed commitment to the \"defense of life, of peace, of joy\"; in this way \"it is possible to defeat those who seek death, destruction, emigration”, the Chaldean Patriarch Mar Raphael Louis Sako tells AsiaNews, describing the festive atmosphere these days in the country, despite episodes of violence.\nAmong the many events that have marked these days of celebration, the Chaldean primate cites three examples: Christmas trees scattered around different neighborhoods in Baghdad; the visit of a group of young Najafdi Shiite Muslims who attended a mass in the capital; the celebrations for the new year in Basra and the invitation of local authorities to Christians, \"to return to their homes.\"\n\"New Year's Eve – says Mar Sako - I went out to go to a square in the Mansour neighborhood of Baghdad. We celebrated with a lot of people, nearly a million people took to the streets. \" \"We talked with them, we exchanged greetings; these are small things - but are important to reject the Daesh ideology of terror \"[Arabic acronym of the Islamic state] who still target the capital with attacks.\nThe \"change\" is visible, continues the Chaldean Patriarch, \"especially in Baghdad, dotted with Christmas trees. And then the many letters of greeting from religious, political authorities, but also of Muslim civil activists and many ordinary people. \" \"I think 2017 - he said - will be another year, maybe not total peace, but certainly greater cohesion, unity. This is my prayer, but it is also the common feeling of the majority of citizens \".\nBasra’s political, religious and institutional authorities have launched an appeal to Christians, asking the many who have emigrated to return to their homes. In the southern Iraqi city New Year's Eve was also celebrated for the first time, demonstrating a greater climate \"cohesion\" among the different souls that make up the local situation and the whole country. The police forces in Basra kept watch so that the celebrations and the festivities were held in complete safety; the County Council has also committed itself to the maintenance and renovation of churches.\n\"The governor and the president of the Municipal Council - Mar Sako continues - came to visit me in these days of celebration. A local Christian politician circulated a letter for the New Year against the war. We Christians have a lot to do for the local community; I asked the local authorities to show their closeness to the Christian communities, and these appeals and these initiatives [at Christmas] is a first response. \" The most significant event of these days, believes Mar Sako, is the visit of a group of young Muslims, boys and girls, originating in Najaf, Shiite Muslims, who attended a mass in the church of St. George. Afterwards, the group had lunch with the patriarch of the Chaldean Church and other members of the executive exchanging stories and personal and community experiences. \"They took part in the church service - recalls the primate Chaldean - and then we posed for photographs with a flag of Iraq and banners for peace. They young people were impressed by the songs and prayers. \"\n\"I explained to them - continues Mar Sako - our faith, in the one God, the",

They have seen a few dedicated services to our community in the media, and they wanted to meet us, creating a personal and direct relationship with us that I hope will continue in the future. Here, from this we can also see the importance of newspapers and TV to provide opportunities for interaction and discussion.

        "prompt": "That's not a hypothetical question. Falling gas prices mean the average household will be about $700 richer this year.\nFor most Americans, trying to cut back on bills involves a mix of discipline and sacrifice: Moving into a smaller place, searching for sales at the grocery store, or forgoing air conditioning on hot days, for examples. But drivers around the country have been getting a reprieve without any effort thanks to falling gas prices. So what are they doing with the unanticipated bonus in their bank accounts? Not saving it, a new report from J.P. Morgan finds.\nThe price of gas peaked at about $3.70 a gallon in 2014. At present, that price has declined by about $1.50. While those single-gallon prices might seem insignificant, they add up. Take the example of a Toyota Camry, one of the nation’s top-selling cars with a fuel tank that holds around 17 gallons: Filling a totally empty tank at the peak would cost over $60. Now it would cost a much more reasonable $37. And for those who rely on their car as the main method of transportation, that’s a big deal. It’s been estimated that over the course of 2015, Americans will save on average $700 thanks to the dip in gas prices. That’s more than government stimulus checks in recent years, which paid out between $300 and $600.\nAnd they’re spending it—most of it, at least. According to the J.P. Morgan Institute, Americans are spending about 80 cents for every dollar they’ve saved. They’re going out to restaurants—which accounted for nearly 20 percent of gas savings—shopping for clothes, and buying groceries, electronics, and appliances.\nThese findings imply that Americans are feeling surprisingly upbeat about the economy. Were they more pessimistic, economists would expect them to be saving a greater portion of the money for the expected tough times ahead, or using the money strictly for essentials, like housing and bills. Other recent reports on the impact of lowered gas prices have painted a less optimistic picture. The Council of Economic Advisors puts the consumption bump at closer to 45 percent of gas savings, and a Gallup poll found that though nearly 60 percent of respondents said they’re feeling the positive effects of lower prices, only about one-quarter said that that they were spending the extra money. The bulk of respondents told Gallup that the money was going toward bills or savings.\nSo what explains the difference? The study’s authors, Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig note that these discrepancies could be related to sample size or more limited data in those surveys. In their study, J.P. Morgan analyzes the spending of 25 million clients via transactions on debit and credit cards between October 2012 and June 2015. While that certainly is a robust sample, it too has its own limitations and biases. For instance the bank’s data won’t capture transactions made with cash or on other credit or debit cards, which could be money that families are using for essentials rather than a night out or a new television. The data could also be skewed to reflect the habits and demographics of the bank’s clientele. For instance, the survey finds that gas bills account for only 2.9 percent of individual’s incomes in 2014 while the Consumer Expenditure Survey reports that it accounts for 3.7 percent, which could reflect a difference between where these sample groups live, their access to public transportation, or their income.\nNonetheless, some of the broad trends are intriguing. The data show that the gas-price infusion is obviously not spread equally among all Americans. It’s more heavily concentrated among those who live in the South and",

The savings are also more meaningful for low-income households—who saw their monthly disposable income climb by more than 1 percent for those pulling in less than $30,000 a year—and young people.\nThough the money spent on gas makes up a nominal amount of consumption in the grand scheme, the impact of gas prices on American families can be a telling way to assess how confident people are feeling about spending. It could also help predict spending trends should prices hold steady, or increase in the future. That could help inform policy decisions on things like gas taxes. For an economy that’s been puttering along with little wage growth, increasing costs of living, and little disposable income—spending is a good thing. It puts more money into businesses, which then creates more jobs and helps spur further economic growth. And there hasn’t been quite enough of that since 2008.",

Very few of the savings are going toward housing, which is a good thing, since the housing market is already overheated in many parts of the country.

Some economists have argued that the savings are a sign of a healthy economy, while others have warned that it could be a sign of a bubble.

        "prompt": "Diana Graeber is one Lake County resident who likes to watch the grass grow - and plants too.\nGraeber volunteers through the Friends of the Horticultural Learning Center. She works in the office and Discovery Garden at the center in Tavares.\nThe Discovery Garden is a three-and-a-half-acre plot behind the center. It is being developed as a series of themed demonstration gardens to be used as a learning tool for Lake residents.\nWhen completed, there will be examples of 16 different gardens, from courtyards to a wildflower meadow to vegetable gardens.\n\"You can look at that three and a half acres and see it was just barren sand,\" Graeber said. \"We have several gardens planted and it really looks super. It's a lot of hard work.\"\nGraeber said she became interested in the learning center when she took a course in 1995 to become a Master Gardener. She had to put in 50 hours of classes and 50 hours of volunteer work in the office or garden to receive her Master Gardener designation.\nFlorida gardening is very different from gardening elsewhere in the country, she said.\n\"We lived in the South about 20 years, but this is the first opportunity I had to really get involved in gardening, and I wanted to learn all I could. It was a place to start. It's something I enjoy doing, and there is so much to learn that you never learn it all,\" Graeber said.\nLloyd Singleton, development associate at the center, coordinates the planning effort for the gardens. Each of the areas is planned, planted and maintained by a committee of volunteers, he said.\nGraeber volunteers between 25 and 30 hours a week at the center. Much of her work is also done outside the center with other volunteer groups and organizations, trying to get them involved with the center.\n\"We have some people who can't take the heat, but there are lots of other things they can do - put on programs, distribute literature, make calls, help with mailing, computer or office work,\" Graeber said. \"There is something for everyone.\"\nAs Graeber walked through the gardens, she explained that it has only been during the last two years that planting has begun because of the lengthy planning process.\nShe pointed out the turf gallery, a place where different grasses can be seen and compared. The recently finished shade garden has a babbling pebble brook. The courtyard gardens will feature six small-space gardens when done.\nThe wetlands garden is under construction and will teach the importance of stormwater runoff management. The vegetable garden, which is planted year-round, donated 2,000 pounds of produce to the Leesburg Food Bank.\nA compost demonstration is to the side of the produce garden. The last of the gardens to be completed will be the children's garden, Graeber said. Plantings will be planned to stimulate all the senses of visiting children.\n\"I think what amazes me more than anything is to come out here every day and see how much has been done,\" Graeber said. \"Not only is it putting new plants in but maintaining what we have already planted.\"\nSingleton said Graeber is capable, willing and organized. She has a phenomenal attitude, he said.\n\"The designing of the gardens is a creative process and anytime there is creative process, there is friction. It takes a special kind of person to get through disagreements and butting heads with a smile on their face.\n\"The end result of the project is going to be so positive because those of us involved can speak our minds and not be offended when we are disagreed with,\" Singleton said.\nA summer program of horticultural videos is being offered at the center. The program is free from noon to 1 p.m. every Wednesday; participants should bring a brown bag lunch. Graeber said the program is a good way for people who are interested in volunteering to become acquainted with the center and see the work being done in the gardens.\nAnyone who is interested",

        "prompt": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU on Wednesday offered Britain a free trade deal for their post-Brexit ties that fell well short of ambitions set out by Prime Minister Theresa May last week, notably for the country’s dominant financial sector.\nIn a draft seen by Reuters, the remaining 27 European Union members said they wanted a close partnership with Britain, but its depth would be limited by Britain’s own wish to leave the bloc’s single market and the customs union.\n“Because of Brexit, we will be drifting apart,” the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk told a news conference, delivering a message that contrasted sharply with May’s call for future trade to be as “frictionless as possible”.\nTusk said that, while he understood May’s goal to make Brexit a success for Britain, that was not the EU’s objective.\nCrucially, the bloc said Britain would be treated like any other third country when it came to financial services - which London had pressed to be included in the future deal.\nFinancial services generate more than 10 percent of Britain’s economic output and are the only area in which it has a trade surplus with the EU, making London very keen to preserve its banks’ current access to continental Europe.\nIn a sign some large banks may be losing patience with the protracted uncertainty about the future, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks.\nThat is one of the first tangible signs that banks are starting to act on Brexit contingency plans to keep what the EU calls passporting rights - the possibility to offer services to all EU clients via just one local license.\nBritish finance minister Philip Hammond called the EU guidelines a very tough position that any skilled negotiator would start with.\nWhile the EU says it does not want to mete out punishment Britain, the trade deal offer will come as another blow to Britain. The bloc has also recently outlined its contingency plans for avoiding an Irish border after Brexit, which Britain said would undermine its constitutional sovereignty.\nWith no passporting rights for its banks, the best option London can hope for is regulatory equivalence, under which they can get more access to the EU market if British financial rules, though not identical to EU ones, are seen by the bloc as achieving the same goals.\nBut Hammond said the EU’s third country equivalence regime would be wholly inadequate, and criticized the only patchy access it gives, as well as the possibility of revoking it at short notice.\nHe said a better solution would be mutual recognition and reciprocal equivalence, with sensible notice periods.\nHe also argued that Britain and the EU could reach a much better agreement on financial services than the EU had reached with Canada. Canadian financial firms must set up a presence inside the bloc and comply with its regulations if they want",

        "prompt": "Last year, this writer looked at the Massy Group of Companies formerly Neal and Massy to gain an understanding of the operations of this company which has been doing business in Guyana for the past 48 years. Given the integral role that the company plays in the Guyana economy, it is worth taking another look at its performance for the financial year 2015 to update one’s understanding of a company which has quietly expanded its operations through the years and is penetrating a growing number of sectors in the country. For those who might not know, Massy before the rebranding exercise in 2014 was in existence for 82 years under the name of Neal and Massy. The company has its headquarters in Trinidad and Tobago and came about as a result of a merger between Neal Engineering Company and Massy Limited in 1932. One outcome of the merger was the establishment of a public company in 1958. Another was the establishment of a subsidiary in Guyana in 1968. It is to the latter that interest will turn eventually in this article.\nOver the years, Massy has remained steadfast in its participation in the Guyana economy. But the growth of the company was not only focused on Guyana. Massy undertook several initiatives to expand its operations, including the expansion into other territories in the Caribbean and the diversification of products and services offered to its customers. As a consequence, the Massy Group is today a large conglomerate that is organized as business segments or business units that cover the range of products and services offered by the company in several countries in the North American and Latin American and Caribbean regions. Despite being in Guyana for 48 years, very little is said or discussed about a company that has been integral to the expansion and alteration of the Guyana economy for a very long time. It is for this reason that this column, once again, seeks to examine the role and place of this organization in Guyana.\nBefore narrowing the focus, it would be useful to present the business architecture of the company. It will help to create a sense of the importance of Massy’s operations in Guyana to the group as a whole. The Massy Group continues to operate as a complex business consisting of six business units, six subsidiaries and three associate companies that conduct operations in 11 countries. In four of the 11 locations, it has one product line while it has multiple product lines in the rest. For example, Massy operates a distribution service in Miami in the United States of America (USA). It operates an insurance service in Curaçao and a retail service in St Vincent and the Grenadines. It also operates a technical support service in Suriname. The remaining countries in which multiple operations take place are Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Colombia, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad & Tobago.\nThe business units cut across several economic sectors and remain the core of its operations. The business units consist of the Automotive and Industrial Equipment unit which controls eight separate companies that sell cars to consumers and heavy equipment to businesses. Then there is the Energy and Industrial Gases Business Unit which controls 18 companies with a similar market focus. The Insurance Unit comprises one company while the Information Technology and Communications Business Unit has control over 10 companies. The Integrated Retail Unit has control over 14 companies. The Finance segment also has six companies in its portfolio. The six business units not only reflect the structure of the organization, they also reflect the business strategy of the entity. Some of the business units have expanded their services or added new services to their portfolio. For example, Massy Communications has extended its business to business Internet and TV service to its consumer market.\nThe Lucas Stock Index (LSI) rose 0.54 per cent during the third period of trading in June 2016. The stocks of six companies were traded with 79,573 shares changing hands. There were three Climbers and one Tumbler. The stocks of Banks DIH (DIH) rose 1.98 per cent on the sale of 18,757 while the stocks of Demerara Distillers Limited (DDL) rose 5.26 per cent on the sale of 41,667 shares. In addition, the stocks of Demerara Tobacco Company (DTC) rose 1.51 per cent on the sale of 13,603 shares. In contrast, the stocks of Demerara Bank Limited (DBL) fell 5.26 per cent on the sale of 4,324 shares. In the meanwhile, the stocks of Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry (BTI) and Republic Bank Limited (RBL) remained unchanged on the sale of 222 and 1,000 shares respectively.\nAs part of its overall strategy, the Massy Group has developed two sets of markets. The Group has dissected its market into business and consumer segments and uses them to deliver its products and services to users. The dual market strategy remains the dominant strategy of the company and is practised in seven of the 11 countries. For the Caricom region, this would be Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, St Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. For Latin America, this would be Colombia. One market is for business customers while the other is for consumers. The automotive, finance, insurance and retail businesses were directed at consumers while the industrial equipment, industrial gases, distribution and logistics, and the technology businesses were directed at other businesses. Now, Internet and TV services are also reaching household customers.\nGuyana is one of the five countries in which Massy has substantial investments. In fact, it is the third most important geographic market for the company when measured in assets, sales revenue and profits. Before discussing Guyana’s importance to the company, it remains important for readers to understand how Guyana fits into the overall Massy structure.\nGuyana was the earliest market into which Massy ventured as a foreign investor. The company came to Guyana in 1968 as Neal and Massy 10 years after it went public. At the time of Neal and Massy’s entry, Guyana was two years into its independence. The arrival of Neal and Massy saw the establishment of Associated Industries Limited (Ainlim). In a short history of itself, Massy reported that after its first 20 years in Guyana, the entity had control of four businesses. These were Ainlim, Demerara Oxygen Company (Docol), Transport Services and Demerara Property Investments. In its second 20 years, Massy made further adjustments to its portfolio in Guyana. During this latter period, Massy added Complete Computer Services, NM Services and NM Security. The Massy organization went through a rebranding exercise which resulted in all its companies carrying the Massy name alone. As such Ainlim is now known as Massy Industries, Docol is now known as Massy Gas while Transportation Services is now known as Massy Trading and Distribution. Complete Computer Services is known as Massy Technologies and NM Services is called Massy Services. One other company, NM Security, is now called Massy Security.\nEach of the above companies is part of a larger business unit. Massy Industries is part of the Automotive and Industrial Engineering business unit. Its market focus is on other businesses in Guyana and provides capital assets. Massy Industries therefore serve the business community in Guyana. Massy Gas operates under the Energy and Industrial Gases business unit.\nLike Massy industries, it serves the business community. Massy Trading and Distribution operates under the Integrated Retail (IR) business unit. Despite being under the IR business unit, the annual report lists it as a company that focuses on serving other businesses. In fact, it is the automotive component of the Automotive and Industrial Engineering business unit that serves the consumer market. The services that are provided through MoneyGram and Sure Pay of the Massy’s Finance unit are also directed at the consumer market.\nAs could be expected, a company with that many parts and locations controls a lot of assets. The Massy Group by Guyana’s standards is a large company. According to the 2015 Annual Report of the Group, it had approximately G$323 billion in assets under its control which helped it to generate an estimated G$385 billion in revenues. The Massy operations in Guyana remain a vital part of the",

The company admitted in its 2014 Annual Report that the good fortunes that the gold and rice industries enjoyed contributed immensely to the economic success reported by the company in that performance year. Emboldened by the business prospects in Guyana, the Massy Group in Guyana opened a 75,000 square foot warehouse facility with modern inventory and warehousing amenities. However, things were not as bright in 2015 on account of the lower price of gold during that year.\nBut Massy’s operations in Guyana are not without problems. Two things are of great concern to the organization. One is safety and the other is customer service. Any Guyanese could understand why the company would be concerned about safety, particularly as it relates to road safety. The company in Guyana had many near misses and two fatal accidents in less than two months in 2014.

        "prompt": "SEATTLE – On the night Ted Lilly pitched the best game of his life – a complete-game one-hitter – he needed to be better to win.\nRelying on his herky-jerky delivery and using his wildness effectively, the easy-going Yankee lefty didn’t give the Mariners a hit until there was one out in the eighth.\nYet, thanks to the Yankees being handcuffed by Freddy Garcia, a single by ex-Met Desi Relaford was the difference in a 1-0 Mariner victory that was witnessed by a sold-out crowd of 46,047.\nLilly hit Jeff Cirillo with one out in the first, and again to start the seventh. In between, Lilly retired 17 straight by using a sneaky fastball that looked better because of Lilly’s ability to throw curveballs and changeups for strikes when he wasn’t bouncing pitches in the dirt or throwing behind batters.\nBut it was a fastball that Relaford spanked to right that scored pinch-runner Luis Ugueto from second, broke Lilly’s heart and lowered his record to 0-2 as Andy Pettitte’s replacement.\nEven when Relaford’s hit fell in, Lilly hoped right fielder Gerald Williams would keep Ugueto at third. Ugueto, who was running for Dan Wilson, who walked, was running on the pitch. He slid into third and had to scramble to get up and score.\n“I knew the guy took off but I still thought we had a chance to throw him out at the plate, or have first and third and I would have a chance to get out of it,” Lilly said.\n“He was already gone,” Gerald Williams said when asked about throwing home.\nIt was the first time since Bill Bevens in 1947 that a Yankee pitcher lost a one-hitter. Bevens was beaten by the Dodgers in Game 4 of the World Series.\nThe loss dropped the Yankees to two games behind the Red Sox in the AL East.\nRiding the team bus to the game, Lilly heard from Roger Clemens that Boston’s Derek Lowe had no-hit the Devil Rays at Fenway Park. While Lilly acknowledged it would be nice to match Lowe, it was nothing more than a passing fantasy.\nUntil the fifth inning. That’s when Lilly began thinking about it. However, he said, since Garcia was matching him with zeroes, there was a more important issue.\nLilly was in a tight one because Garcia’s sinking fastball gave the Yankees fits. Still, the Yankees had a lot more chances to score off Garcia than the Mariners had against Lilly.\nThey had first and third with two outs in the first and Garcia got Robin Ventura on a grounder. John Vander Wal’s one-out single in the second was erased when the slumping Nick Johnson (1-for-21) hit into a double play.\nAlfonso Soriano reached third with one out in the sixth when right fielder Charles G",

After Bernie Williams walked, Garcia fed Derek Jeter a sinker that he pounded into a 6-4-3 double play.\nThe futility continued in the eighth when Vander Wal hit a leadoff ground-rule double to left. Gerald Williams ran for Vander Wal but never left second because Garcia fanned Johnson, Alberto Castillo and Soriano.\n“If there was a runner on third I would have gone to Jorge [Posada],” Torre said of hitting for the anemic-swinging Castillo, who is 0-for-11.\nPresented with a final chance in the ninth against closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, the Yankees failed. Jeter singled with one out in front of Jason Giambi’s stress-free fly to left. A five-pitch walk to Ventura followed but Rondell White ended the thriller by swinging through a 2-2 pitch.",

Announced at CeBIT 2002 in Hannover, the Athlon XP 2100+ is the last of the 0.18-micron 'Palomino' processors to ship before AMD moves to a 0.13-micron fabrication process with the 'Thoroughbred' core.\nIntel, of course, has been shipping 0.13-micron 'Northwood' Pentium processors since the beginning of the year, its fastest chip currently being the 2.2GHz part. AMD now uses a rating system rather than the true clock speed to identify its processors: the 2100+ is judged to be the equivalent of a 2.1GHz 'Thunderbird' Athlon (the core preceding the Palomino), but actually runs at 1.73GHz. This is only a 67MHz increase on the previous fastest Athlon XP, the 2000+, which runs at 1.67GHz. Since previous tests have shown the XP 2000+ to be more than a match for Intel's Northwood Pentium 4 on many benchmarks, we expected top-notch performance from Mesh's XP 2100+-based system.\nThe bulky tower-encased Matrix XP 2100+PPC is built around an ASUS A7V333 Socket A motherboard, which uses VIA's KT333 chipset. The A7V333 provides an array of up-to-the-minute features, including support for DDR SDRAM up to 333MHz, Ultra-ATA data transfers at up to 133MB/sec and USB 2.0 expansion. Our review system was fitted with 512MB of 266MHz DDR memory in two of the motherboard's three DIMM sockets. Storage is provided by an 80GB 7,200rpm Maxtor Ultra-ATA/133 hard disk, and there are two optical drives -- a 16X Pioneer DVD-ROM and a 24X write, 10X rewrite, 40X read TEAC CD-RW. There's also a standard floppy drive in the single external 3.5in. bay, and one external 5.25in. bay remains free for further expansion. Inside, the drive cage has room for another 3.5in. device. Two of the motherboard's five PCI slots are occupied, by a Sound Blaster Audigy that also provides an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) port, and a 56Kbit/s modem. The AGP slot is occupied by an ATI Radeon 8500LE graphics card fitted with 64MB of DDR SDRAM.\nAll the standard I/O ports are present and correct on the back panel -- serial (2), parallel, PS/2 (2) along with a good complement of USB connectors. Two USB 1.1 ports and two fast USB 2.0 ports are provided as standard, and Mesh has connected two further ports to the USB 1.1 header on the motherboard (which also supports a further two USB 2.0 ports in a similar fashion if necessary).\nThe monitor supplied with the Matrix XP 2100+PPC is NEC's 17in. flat-panel MultiSync LCD1700V, which saves desk space compared to an equivalent CRT monitor and delivers a bright, clear 1,280 by 1,024 pixel image. An LCD monitor is great for everyday applications, but gamers or users of graphically demanding software may prefer a CRT monitor, which can deliver a superior refresh rate and better colour fidelity.\nWhen it comes to overall performance, the Athlon XP 2100+-based",

However, it's worth noting that Dell's Pentium 4 system had 256MB of RAM compared to the Mesh's 512MB. Graphics performance is excellent, the 64MB Radeon 8500LE delivering the fastest 3DMark 2001 score we've seen so far -- although we've yet to test a desktop PC with a graphics card that uses the new nVidia GeForce4 chip.\nWith Windows XP Home Edition pre-installed and Lotus SmartSuite 9.7 bundled, the Mesh Matrix XP 2100+PPC delivers top-notch performance and is good value at £1,399 (ex.

        "prompt": "A proposed retirement facility near the water in Pierrefonds-Roxboro is causing discontent in the neighbourhood.\nResidents who live in the Cap-St-Jacques sector of Pierrefonds-Roxboro gathered at borough hall last week to voice considerable discontent with plans to build a 12-storey Groupe Sélection retirement facility at the intersection of Gouin Blvd. and Chemin de la Rive-Boisée.\nGroupe Sélection specializes in retirement facilities and has 50 facilities either in development, under construction or already operational, province wide.\nResidents shared their concerns with the borough’s urban planning advisory community, chaired by Cap-St-Jacques councillor Catherine Clément-Talbot. Groupe Sélection director of architecture Mathieu Millette was on hand to field questions.\nThe fact that the project would be located on a 20-100-year flood zone and snuggled up to a 0-20-year flood zone raised eyebrows. Water-adjacent properties in Pierrefonds-Roxoboro were ravaged during historic flooding in 2017. The flooding devastated a number of Quebec municipalities, prompting the government to request an updated map of the province’s flood zones. However, the new map has yet to materialize, so the location of the retirement facility is based on dated information.\nMillette told the gathering that design measures were in place to manage any future flooding. The first floor of apartments would be much higher than in a standard condo tower, the underground parking structure would be impermeable — “sealed like a ship” — the entrance to the parking lot would have a raised lip to prevent water flowing in and a pump would be installed in the underground parking lot to handle any water mishaps.\nAnd there were questions about why the entrance to the parking lot was on the residential Rive-Boisée street and not Gouin Blvd. — a main thoroughfare. Millette said the configuration of the property, which includes land designated a 0-20-year flood zone which cannot be developed in any way, meant there was only one possible location for the underground parking entrance that would allow for fluid underground vehicle circulation. He said that Groupe Sélection statistics show that retired tenants don’t all have cars and if they do, they use them less. Those opposed to the construction remained unconvinced.\nClément-Talbot said the project remained “a working document” and that the committee was taking note of the comments and would discuss them in caucus to see if any recommendations for modifications should be made.\nBecause no zoning changes are required to",

The other major build discussed was a 72-unit condo tower — Phase 3 in a three-building project with two phases already under construction. It triggered multiple questions about traffic circulation. Phase 3 will be located near the corner of Pierrefonds Blvd. and Paul-Pouliot St. The promoter explained that Phase 3 underground parking would be accessed off Pierrefonds Blvd. and via Phase 2’s underground parking through a connecting tunnel.

Image via the AP.\n6.3 million Floridians were under mandatory evacuation orders as of this morning in preparation for Hurricane Irma, which Florida governor Rick Scott is calling “a deadly, deadly storm surge.” Irma pummeled the Caribbean late Friday night as a Category 5 storm, claiming the lives of at least 24 people and leaving a scene which the Washington Post describes as “apocalyptic.” It has since been downgraded to a Category 3 but is expected to regain strength as it winds its way up Florida’s west coast as early as Sunday morning.\nMeteorologists expect flooding of up to 15 feet and Category 4 winds up to 140mph, CNN reports. 25,000 power outages were reported from Florida this morning, and FEMA expects them to last for days.\nMany assisted-living homes are bracing for senior citizens to stay, CNN reports. NPR has interviewed some of Miami’s 530,000 living below the poverty line, those who lack basic resources like food and water and will not be able to rely on an overburdened government for help.\nThe Miami New Times, which is live-blogging the event, is keeping track of the low-income laborers who are most affected, like fast food workers forced to stay in evacuation zones. Employees whose jobs are being threatened or are not given enough time to evacuate are directed to fill out a survey or drop a voicemail at 407-920-8927 with the nonprofit Central Florida Jobs With Justice. The Naples Daily News also reports that some government employees who choose to leave will risk losing their jobs.\nOver the past few days, the Pasco county and Flagler county have been using prisoners to fill sandbags. “If you are still in need of sandbags, head to the Bunnell Fire Station and let the inmates do the labor for you,” Sheriff Rick Staly said in a press release. “They will fill the bags and load them into your vehicle.” They are now out of sand.\nAs of this writing on Saturday afternoon, Irma’s winds are just beginning to batter Florida. The Naples sheriff is telling people it’s too late to evacuate, and to head to an emergency shelter.\nABC and the Miami National Weather Service are tweeting new shelter locations as they open.\nUPDATE 4:39pm EST: Speaking of the headline here, Michelle Welk of",

USA Today has reported that Representative Stacey Plaskett, the Virgin Islands’ delegate to Congress, has called St. Thomas and St. John “devastated,” while the storm has “crippled” the only hospital in St. Thomas.\n“We are islands. There are not just trucks that can roll in to help us,” she said. Trump approved a disaster declaration for the U.S. Virgin Islands which would hopefully expedite funding, but Welk predicts that, as unincorporated territories, they will be “an afterthought” for federal relief. Welk recommends donating to small 501c3s including the St. John Community Foundation, St. John Rescue, and the Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands.

Kate Brown signed a law banning the box from job applications in the state.\n“Eliminating the question ensures the qualifications rather than the conviction records are considered early in the hiring process,” said Joy St. Germain, the city’s human resources director.\nCity Councilwoman Victoria Woodards said a question on a job application asking about felony convictions can be daunting for people looking to move beyond their pasts and become productive members of society",

Hiring managers will consider the specific offense and whether it matters to the position the applicant seeks, St. Germain said.\nPierce County banned the box in 2012 after guidance from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Like Tacoma, the county does background checks on potential employees, which include a criminal history, references and an employment check.\nCounty deputy director for human resources Joe Carrillo said he doesn’t recall a case since the change in which a job seeker was turned away after managers learned of a criminal history.\nIn addition, the applicant pool has not significantly changed, he said.\n“An employee coming to work for us generally knows they are going to be given some form of a background review,” Carrillo said. “… I think (applicants with offenses) know their history.",

They have done their time. They have done their probation. They have done their parole. They have done everything that they were supposed to do. And they are ready to move on with their lives.”\nThe city’s decision to remove the question from job applications is part of a larger effort to reduce recidivism, Woodards said. The city is also working with the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department to provide re-entry services for people coming out of prison.\nThe city’s decision to remove the question from job applications is part of a larger effort to reduce recidivism, Woodards said.

It does not affect private employers.\nThe city’s decision to ban the box comes as the state is considering a similar move. The state House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would prohibit employers from asking about criminal history on job applications. The bill is now in the Senate.\nIn a press release, the state’s Department of Justice said the law would help ensure that qualified applicants are not screened out of the hiring process because of their criminal history.\n“People with criminal records are often highly motivated to work and have a strong desire to",

Zehm said the law still allows them to check criminal histories, but it requires they do so after the initial interview.\nThe law also does not prevent employers from asking about criminal history during the application process if the job requires a background check under state or federal law.\nFor example, a job that requires the handling of money or a job that requires the handling of children would require a background check under state law.\nThe law also does not prevent employers from asking about criminal history during the application process",

        "prompt": "The Alaska fishery could be America’s last great resource giveaway–and powerful companies are fighting for a piece of it.\nDon Tyson has never fished aboard a Bering Sea trawler, risking his life against treacherous weather to bring home a catch of cod or pollock. He hasn’t worked a midnight deck shift in 30-foot seas or used a baseball bat to pound at the ice that builds up on riggings and rails.\nTyson lives in the hill country of northwest Arkansas, more than 3,000 miles from Alaska. “I’m just a chicken farmer,” he likes to say. But this chicken farmer has turned a modest family business into one of the nation’s largest food conglomerates, grossing more than $4 billion a year.\nTyson Foods now wants to claim one of the biggest shares of the Alaska fishery. The harvest rights it seeks from the federal government would be worth tens of millions of dollars each year. And unless federal law is amended, the government may hand over the fishery without Tyson–or anyone else–paying a dime in royalties.\nTyson has developed strong ties with President Bill Clinton, and those ties could help the company as it makes its case. The Alaska governor’s office says Tyson representatives “definitely” led them to believe they have influence in Washington.\nThe privatization of the Alaska fishery could be the country’s last great resource handout. The prairies were homesteaded in the past century; the railroads have claimed their vast land grants; many of the rich mining deposits on public lands have long since been staked out. The Alaska fishery is one of the richest in the world, with a treasure trove of pollock, cod, crab, and other species. It’s a resource many Americans don’t even know they own.\nTyson ventured into the fishing industry in June 1992, just about the time that Bill Clinton consolidated his hold on the Democratic presidential nomination. The corporation sought a seafood entree for its corporate dinner plate, and so spent $212 million to buy Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corp., the largest fishing company in the country.\nSome industry observers questioned Tyson’s purchase because Seattle-based Arctic Alaska had an aging fleet and a formidable array of legal problems. The worst of these problems were detailed last April, when a federal grand jury hit Arctic Alaska with a 44-count indictment. It charged the company with sending unsafe ships to sea, falsifying documents, and lying about crew qualifications, among other crimes. The grand jury said these acts were part of a conspiracy that had put profits ahead of people and led to the 1990 sinking of an Arctic Alaska fishing vessel, an accident that killed nine people.\nBut Arctic Alaska’s single-minded pursuit of fish helped it to become one of the biggest seafood harvesters in the Bering Sea. And the quantity of fish Arctic Alaska caught, irrespective of how many laws it may have broken to catch them, has put the company–and its new owner Tyson–in a position to win a big share of the fishery.\nTyson Foods is wealthy and well-connected, but it isn’t the only major player in the high-stakes fish lotto. Another is Christiania Bank of Norway, which bankrolled a big chunk of the Bering Sea fleet with more than $300 million in loans. Most of those loans are now in default, and the bank hopes to take the fishing shares of the boats that can’t pay up. Other players include largely Japanese-owned shore processors; the catcher-boat fleet and hook-and-line fishermen who deliver to the processors; and native Eskimo and Aleut fishermen.\nThey all recognize that big changes are coming to the Bering Sea fishery. Too many fishermen, wielding awesome fishing technology, are going after too few fish. When the fleet shrinks there will be winners and losers. All the players are trying to make sure that whatever reform takes place will put them in the winners’ circle.\nAlaska’s trawlers threw away 763 million pounds of fish last year. Under the reform backed by Tyson, some of the most wasteful companies would get the biggest shares of the fishery.\nSo far, the federal government has tried to manage the catch by limiting the seasons for different species of fish. Seasons that once stretched out for most of the year have shrunk to a few months. This turns the harvests into frantic derbies in which boats grab as much as they can as fast as they can. The result is incredible waste, unsafe fishing practices, and economic chaos for the industry.\nScientists are also increasingly concerned about the effects of this intensive fishing on the broader Bering Sea ecosystem. The Steller sea lion, for instance, is now listed as a threatened species. Scientists have also tracked sharp population declines in fur seals and some sea birds. And while the stocks of pollock still appear relatively healthy, their total biomass has declined.\nMeanwhile, the fishermen slug it out in ever-shorter seasons. Under the derby system, they lack the time and financial incentives to try to avoid catching fish that aren’t worth processing or are not legally in season. Last year, the Alaska fleet caught 4.2 billion pounds of fish, then dumped a staggering 763 million pounds–seven times more fish than is retained by the entire New England fleet. As the competition intensifies, so do the pressures to keep fishing through the worst winter storms, increasing the risks in an occupation that has already killed more than 165 fishermen off Alaska in the past six years.\nTo top it all off, the harvests, despite their gargantuan scale, are too small to sustain the overcapitalized fleet. Some vessel owners have already filed for bankruptcy, and more filings are expected later this year.\nAs a solution to these problems, Tyson and some other players are politicking for a kind of 20th-century homestead act. The plan would divide the annual harvest into shares, which would be given to fishing companies in proportion to some part of their historic catch. The more fish and crab an operator caught in the past, the bigger its share. Companies could then leisurely fish their shares (called “individual transferable quotas,” or ITQs), lease them to other operators, or sell them to the highest bidder. The total market value of all the shares could easily exceed $1 billion according to several industry officials.\nBy ending the race for fish, factory trawler operators say they could curtail the waste. Boats would target the species they want and would take the time to process whatever fish they caught. Skippers would avoid practices that endangered the lives of their crew members. And the fleet would shrink as marginal operators sold out their shares. “We are convinced that the future of the fishery up there is dependent on getting toward some sort of ITQ system,” said Archie Schaffer, an Arkansas-based spokesperson for Tyson.\nBut not everyone agrees that privately held quotas are the best way to reform the harvest. Even if the government does turn to private quotas, critics say, the public should scrutinize the deals and gain fair payment. They fear quotas would prevent future generations of small boat fishermen from breaking into the harvest. And they question a system that would reward those companies with the biggest historic catches, since those companies may have been the ones that flooded the harvest grounds with too many boats, or broke safety and environmental regulations, or wasted the most fish.\nThe hub of the Bering Sea fishery is the remote island community of Unalaska, located some 800 miles southwest of Anchorage on the Aleutian chain. Unalaska moves to the rhythms of the fisheries, with great spasms of activity each winter as the factory trawler and crab fleets move north from Seattle to prepare for season openings. Hundreds of boisterous–sometimes brawling–fishermen and processing crews descend on the island bars as the vessels take on fuel, food, and other supplies. Then they take to the sea to work in mind-numbing shifts of six hours on, six hours off, for what may be weeks on end.\nMore than half of the Alaska bottom fish is taken by an at-sea factory fleet that harvests with trawl nets and lines dangling thousands of baited hooks. Tyson has a considerable stake in this fleet, but many of the biggest vessels are financed by Christiania and other foreign banks, and some are actually owned by foreign investors.\nIn addition to the factory ships, there are boats that deliver fish to shore plants for processing. One of the smallest of these is the 85-foot Lone Star, skippered by Chuck Burrece.\nIn the early days of the fishery, Burrece could find plenty of cod without venturing far from port. But this year, the season was short and the old fishing spot near town was closed to protect Steller sea lions. To find cod, Burrece had to push the Lone Star to its limits, journeying 60 to 70 miles out to the dangerous strait known as Unimak Pass.\nHe worked the fishing ground for three days with a trawl net that scooped up about 200,000 pounds of edible fish. But Burrece and his two crewmen dumped some 70,000 pounds of dead and dying pollock, sole, and halibut. They got rid of the halibut because federal regulations retain them for the hook-and-line fleet. The rest went over because the plant Burrece delivers to was only prepared to handle cod.\nThe shore processors (most of which are owned by Japanese conglomerates) are another group concerned with how the fishery is reformed. They have managed to win special federal protection that guarantees them 35 percent of the pollock harvest through 1995. After that date, they fear they will lose out altogether in a reform program that simply doles out catching rights. They have argued for a second tier of “processing rights” that would mandate that they handle a portion of the catch. “If there’s some benefit that’s going to be handed out, we want to belly up to the bar like everyone else,” says Dennis Phelan, a vice president of the Pacific Seafood Processors Association.\nTyson’s outpost in Unalaska is in a small two-story office building squeezed between the mountains and a long dock frequented by its fleet. A sign posted on the wall warns crew members that “fighting, public intoxication, and reporting to the vessels under the influence of alcohol” are cause for firing. Don Tyson’s son, John, who helped to arrange the Arctic Alaska buyout, has tried several times to visit the company’s Unalaska outpost, but each time his aircraft was unable to land due to foul weather. The senior Tyson has yet to make the journey.\nFrom a single chicken processing plant in the 1950s, Tyson has grown into the world’s largest poultry producer. During the past 25 years, the company, through more than 20 acquisitions, sought to dominate a major share of the American food industry by expanding its “center-of-the-plate” protein offerings to include pork, beef, and now fish.\nSo far that strategy has paid off for both Tyson and its investors. The company’s stock ranked third in total returns during the 20-year period that ended in 1992, according to one financial analysis. Last year, Tyson reported sales of $4.7 billion.\nTyson has also cultivated political ties, most notably with Bill Clinton after he was elected Arkansas’ governor. Tyson offered Clinton rides in the company’s corporate jet and became an important fund-raiser during his presidential bid. Tyson Food executives and their families gave $20,750 to Clinton’s campaign and another $22,000 to Democratic Party organizations. The company’s chief legal counsel, James Blair, is a close personal friend of the Clintons and advised Hillary on her well-publicized cattle futures trading.\nThe week before Tyson announced its 1992 purchase of Arctic Alaska, word of the buyout apparently leaked, triggering a surge of Arkansas investment in the fishing company. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating a group of Arkansas investors, including a firm then headed by White House Administration Director Patsy Thomasson, for possible insider trading. For those investors, short-term profits were spectacular. When Tyson announced the buyout price, Arctic Alaska’s stock shot up 69 percent.\nBut Tyson’s stock dipped at the news, foreshadowing later trouble. Tyson took over a company that would ultimately be saddled with a criminal indictment.\nArctic Alaska was founded in 1983 by fisherman Francis Miller. At the time of Tyson’s buyout, the company owned more than 30 trawlers, hook-and-line boats, and crab vessels.\nMany of the vessels had been converted from other uses and shipped north without meeting stability standards required by the Coast Guard. One of those vessels, the Aleutian Enterprise, sank in a 1990 accident that claimed nine lives and triggered April’s grand jury indictment against the company, Miller, and other Arctic officials of that era.\nThe indictment painted a chilling picture of unqualified officers leading green–sometimes teenage–crews out to sea in unsafe ships. Officers must submit sea time to gain certification, and an affidavit unsealed after the indictment charged that Arctic Alaska officials had falsified that sea time.\nIn addition, Tyson has found that Miller was lax in pollution controls. Last year, Arctic Alaska was hit with a $750,000 fine by the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to grind and properly dispose of fish wastes under the Miller regime. The company also faces a criminal lawsuit filed by the state of Alaska charging that the fleet repeatedly fished with illegal bottom gear in sensitive coastal waters. Tyson has hired Alaska Gov. Walter Hickel’s personal attorney, Hal Horton, to help settle the still-pending charges against Arctic Alaska. According to state officials, Tyson also flew legal counsel and Clinton friend James Blair up from Little Rock to plead Arctic Alaska’s case.\nSome fishing industry insiders wondered why Tyson would invest in a North Pacific company when it was apparent that too many boats were already chasing the fish. In an interview a few months after the acquisition, John Tyson told a trade journal that the company took its cue, in part, from industry proposals to create the share system. Tyson hopes that Arctic Alaska’s long catch history will ensure a large slice of the fish pie. As it lobbies for the new system, Tyson is positioning itself as an “all-American” company that has a more legitimate claim to the resource than the foreign investors and banks that stand behind many other fishery players.\nWhen the world fished only with small nets, hooks, and lines, instead of trawls the size of small shopping malls, the ocean could make fish as fast as we killed and ate them. From 1988 to 1990, Americans ate a record 47 pounds of seafood each, much of it imported; the Japanese, 160 pounds; and Icelanders, 203 pounds. The Maldivians on the Indian Ocean were the champions at 293 pounds.\nFor decades foreign fleets controlled many of the trawler harvests in U.S. coastal waters. The 1976 Magnuson Act, which put a 200-mile zone under U.S. control, was in large part an attempt to claim the harvest for Americans. That vision was reaffirmed in 1987 by legislation that banned most foreign vessels from reflagging as U.S. ships, and also restricted foreign ownership of U.S. fishing vessels.\nBut some in Congress had doubts about squeezing off foreign investment that might help finance the American fleet, and the legislation had plenty of loopholes. During the next five years, some boats came under the direct control of foreign investors, while others were beholden to foreign banks.\nThe single biggest financier was Christiania Bank of Norway, which loaned at least $315 million to factory trawlers and other vessels. These vessels stampeded into the Bering Sea in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Now, with the short seasons and low prices, many ship operators can’t make their payments. Christiania has foreclosed on at least four factory trawlers.\nAlong with the vessels, Christiania hopes to gain control of any fishing rights awarded to these companies. According to a Christiania loan document, the bank has asked its borrowers to sign covenants that pledge these rights as collateral. That means if the bank calls a loan, it will end up with both the vessel and a piece of the U.S. fishery.\nThe politics of fish in America have clearly promoted development over sustainability. Modern industrial fishing is run by insiders, many of whose fortunes depend on the decisions they make. Foxes and henhouses come to mind.\nThe power to determine the fate of the Alaska fishery rests with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, an 11-member group dominated by fishing industry representatives. They pass their plans on to the National Marine Fisheries Service, an agency in the Commerce Department, for final approval.\nMost of the council members are from Alaska, and they have frequently aligned themselves with the shore plant operators out of concern that a share plan would give most of the harvest to out-of-state factory trawlers.\nNonetheless, the council has already approved a share plan for the $100 million-a-year hook-and-line harvest of halibut and black cod, and is now considering a share plan for the rest of the harvest. The hook-and-line plan set aside a small percentage of the catch for regional natives, and the new plan might do the same.\nThe council has been slow in developing the new share plan. In April, it voted to consider a two-step process that would first limit the size of the fleet, then eventually award rights. In a nod to conservation concerns, the plan also called for incentives that would give extra quotas to fishermen who reduced waste.\nTyson and other factory trawler owners have been lobbying to get the program on a faster track. For Tyson, that’s also meant trying to improve the company’s image in Alaska. Last March, Don Tyson flew to Alaska to meet with Gov. Hickel and other state officials. Tyson talked of investing in shore plants and using the corporation’s power to push more fish into the American diet.\nAlaska state officials claim that one Tyson representative said the company could talk to the White House about lifting a ban on the foreign export of Alaska oil, a congressional embargo that costs the state hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. “They definitely left us with the impression that they had influence with the Clinton administration,” says John Manly, Gov. Hickel’s spokesperson. What Tyson wanted was fishery council members who would support a quota system.\nThus far, Tyson’s success in shaping the council has been limited. For each vacant seat, the governor proposes three candidates, one of whom is selected to fill the post by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. One of the nominees Tyson favored was pressured to withdraw by Alaska officials who feared a council tilt toward the Arkansas company. Another Tyson-backed candidate, Clem Tillion, is a controversial figure in Alaska, and the state Senate has asked Brown to pick someone else.\nIf the council fails to deliver on the quota plan, Tyson or other factory trawler operators could go over their heads by lobbying the Clinton administration and Congress. Some factory trawler representatives have already proposed an amendment to the Magnuson Act–now up for reauthorization–that would give the Commerce Department power to develop a plan on its own.\nBut Rollie Schmitten, the director of the National Marine Fisheries Service, says the regional council should decide whether to introduce share plans. Schmitten also proposes a new fishing industry fee to finance $82 million of his agency’s $280 million annual budget, a cost currently picked up by taxpayers. And he thinks those fortunate enough to claim harvest shares bear a special burden to pay. “If you are going to bestow a public resource to certain individuals, then there ought to be some sort of equity to the public,” Schmitten says.\nThe Magnuson Act generally prohibits the government from levying fees on the use of national fisheries, but many members of Congress are joining Schmitten in pushing for amendments to the act that would allow for fees to help pay the cost of managing the resource and enforcing regulations.\nThe battle over the future of this fishery is likely to play out over the next few years both in Washington, D.C., and at Alaska council meetings. And while fishermen fight over who gets to profit from the resource, it will be up to the council and fishery managers to keep the fishery healthy.\nMany fishermen are convinced that Alaska fisheries will remain strong, avoiding the fate of New England, Newfoundland, and other great fisheries that have been fished out. But conservationists fear these harvests could be the last buffalo hunts of a dwindling resource.\nEveryone from Tyson officials to small boat fishermen like Chuck Burrece now speaks the gospel of conservation.

        "prompt": "What a Black President Means to \"Racism\"\nBarack Obama speaks to attendees at the 99th annual convention of the NAACP in 2008. Traditional black organizations like the NAACP have to use opportunity of a black president to be about more than \"image.\"\nConsidering \"president of the United States\" is without a doubt one of the hardest jobs in the world, everyone knows the heavy load that Barack Obama is preparing to take onto his shoulders.\nThe fact that he is the first black man (however that word and phrase is defined) to be taking this job adds ever slightly a bit more scrutiny that will be expected.\nThe question: Is the black community prepared to recognize its own new level of responsibility that the \"First Brotha in the White House\" will undoubtedly create?\nIn short, fairly or unfairly, African Americans as a group will be seen in a different light now. Already, there is an undercurrent within the media that, \"Obama's elected; racism as a problem for blacks is over!\" While that's not an accurate reality, there is a kernel of truth to it. To the extent that racism exists -- and traditional black organizations feel the need to address it -- it had better be real egregious cases.\nThe head of the Alabama NAACP, however, wants Mobile's Azalea Trail Maids to stay home on Inauguration Day, claiming the group reminds him of slavery.\n\"These are not just regular costumes. These are the costumes that remind someone of the plantation in Gone with the Wind,\" Edward Vaughn said in a phone interview.\nYes, Mr. Vaughn, the plantation in Gone With The Wind. And, exactly what will the people be reminded of when the Trail Maids march by the presidential review booth on Inauguration Day? As they pass by a black president?\nEven if the Trail Maids are evocative of some forgotten Southern past -- and this black man (yes, I am black -- no joke) isn't even willing to grant Vaughn that -- the reality of a President Barack Obama is a much greater repudiation of that alleged misty-eyed memory than any whining that the Alabama NAACP might raise.\nThere",

The Trail Maids have nothing to do with them. A President Obama can only do so much to address them.

The book shows a more personal side to the sometimes stern-face “Twilight Zone” host who would step out of the shadows, cigarette in hand, to deliver that week’s opening and closing remarks.\nActivities for SerlingFest will begin July 5 at the Bundy Museum, then continue on July 6 at the DoubleTree Hotel and on July 7 at the Forum (where there is a wall of Serling-related photos). The new “Twilight Zone” escape room at the Southern Tier Independence Center will be open all weekend, but SerlingFest attendees will visit en masse on July 8.\nAmong the talks will be Bundy Museum historian Mike Pipher discussing Binghamton’s connections to “The Twilight Zone” and Serling’s military service as a World War II paratrooper in the Pacific; and TV critic Mark Dawidziak (author of \"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in the Twilight Zone\") will make connections between Serling and author Mark Twain, who spent summers in Elmira writing “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” “The Prince and the Pauper” and other classic works.\nOn July 7, the winners of the Rod Serling Film Festival will be honored. The contest, organized by WSKG Public Media, is open to students across the country from kindergarten through 12th grade. Entries are judged in various categories such as best social commentary, best experimental film and the Spirit of Serling Award. The winning entries will be screened.\nSerlingFest organizer Nicholas Parisi — whose book “Rod Serling: His Life, Work, and Imagination” will be released in October — is thrilled to bring together a diverse set of experts to offer a closer look at Serling’s history and legacy.\nAnne Serling admits that discussing",

Although the program premiered in October, they are leaning toward keeping the event alongside July Fest and the Binghamton Music & Jazz Festival to give attendees even more ways to explore and enjoy Binghamton.\nThe long-range goal of the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation would be to amplify Binghamton’s place as Serling’s hometown with a statue, murals and other reminders, as well as a museum similar to what Jamestown has for comedy legend Lucille Ball.\nNearly 60 years later, the iconic stories and lessons of “The Twilight Zone” continue to resonate.",

        "prompt": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Surging shale production is poised to push U.S. oil output to more than 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970 and crossing a threshold few could have imagined even a decade ago.\nAnd this new record, expected within days, likely won’t last long. The U.S. government forecasts that the nation’s production will climb to 11 million barrels a day by late 2019, a level that would rival Russia, the world’s top producer.\nThe economic and political impacts of soaring U.S. output are breathtaking, cutting the nation’s oil imports by a fifth over a decade, providing high-paying jobs in rural communities and lowering consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent from a 2008 peak.\n“It has had incredibly positive impacts for the U.S. economy, for the workforce and even our reduced carbon footprint” as shale natural gas has displaced coal at power plants, said John England, head of consultancy Deloitte’s U.S. energy and resources practice.\nU.S. energy exports now compete with Middle East oil for buyers in Asia. Daily trading volumes of U.S. oil futures contracts have more doubled in the past decade, averaging more than 1.2 billion barrels per day in 2017, according to exchange operator CME Group.\nThe U.S. oil price benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, is now watched closely worldwide by foreign customers of U.S. gasoline, diesel and crude.\nThe question of whether the shale sector can continue at this pace remains an open debate. The rapid growth has stirred concerns that the industry is already peaking and that production forecasts are too optimistic.\nThe costs of labor and contracted services have recently risen sharply in the most active oilfields; drillable land prices have soared; and some shale financiers are calling on producers to focus on improving short-term returns rather than expanding drilling.\nBut U.S. producers have already far outpaced expectations and overcome serious challenges, including the recent effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to sink shale firms by flooding global markets with oil.\nThe cartel of oil-producing nations backed down in November 2016 and enacted production cuts amid pressure from their own members over low prices - which had plunged to below $27 earlier that year from more than $100 a barrel in 2014.\nShale producers won the price war through aggressive cost-cutting and rapid advances in drilling technology. Oil now trades above $64 a barrel, enough for many U.S. producers to finance both expanded drilling and dividends for shareholders.\nEfficiencies spurred by the battle with OPEC - including faster drilling, better well designs and more fracking - helped U.S. firms produce enough oil to successfully lobby for the repeal of a ban on oil exports. In late 2015, Congress overturned the prohibition it had imposed following OPEC’s 1973 embargo.\nThe United States now exports up to 1.7 million barrels per day of crude, and this year will have the capacity to export 3.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Terminals conceived for importing liquefied natural gas have now been overhauled to allow exports.\nThat export demand, along with surging production in remote locations such as West Texas and North Dakota, has led to a boom in U.S. pipeline construction. Firms including Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products Partners added 26,000 miles of liquids pipelines in the five years between 2012 and 2016, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Several more multi-billion-dollar pipeline projects are on the drawing board.\nU.S. drillers say they can supply plenty more.\n“We continue to see and drive improvements” in drilling speed and efficiency, said Mathias Schlecht, a technology vice president at Baker Hughes, General Electric Co’s oilfield services business.\nNew wells can be drilled in as little as a week, he said. A few years ago, it could take up to a month.\nThe next phase of shale output growth depends on techniques to squeeze more oil from each well. Companies are now putting sensors on drill bits to more precisely access oil deposits, using artificial intelligence and remote operators to get the most out of equipment and trained engineers.\nAs expanded investments push more producers to add wells in less productive regions, technology will help make those plays more profitable, said Kate Richard, chief executive of Warwick Energy Group, which owns interests in more than 5,000 U.S. wells.\nIn an interview, she estimated about a third of the money from private equity investments in shale will be used to wring more oil from overlooked regions.\nHigher prices - up about $10 a barrel in the last two months - also may encourage the industry to work through a backlog of some 7,300 drilled-but-uncompleted shale wells that have built up because of crew and equipment shortages.\nThe higher prices have suppliers that provide hydraulic fracturing services, such as Keane Group and Liberty Oilfield Services, buying expensive new equipment in anticipation of more work.\nU.S. fracking service revenues are expected to grow by 20 percent this year, approaching a record of $29 billion set in 2014, according to oilfield research firm Spears & Associates.\nThe shale revolution initially upended the traditional industry hierarchy, making billionaires out of wildcatters such as Harold Hamm, who founded Continental Resources, and the late Aubrey McClendon of Chesapeake Energy.\nTop U.S. oil firms such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron a decade ago turned much of",

Chevron this year plans to spend $4.3 billion on shale development.\nThe majors’ shift is driving up costs for labor and drillable land in the region, another boost to wages and wealth in rural areas.\nIn the shale industry hub of Midland, Texas, unemployment has fallen to a mere 2.6 percent, said Willie Taylor, executive director of the Permian Basin Workforce Development Board, a group that helps firms find staff.\nCompanies are now offering signing bonuses to attract workers to West Texas.

        "prompt": "Demand better regulations from your legislators (and buy a filter in the meantime).\nIn April 2015, Deborah Graham, a resident of the tiny town of Salisbury, North Carolina, received a letter from the North Carolina Division of Public Health, who wanted to let her know that the water coming out of her tap–the same water she used to fill her kids’ water bottles and cook dinner–was chock-full of vanadium, a coal-ash-derived chemical that causes nausea and, later in life, neurological decline. The public health authority also sent notices to 424 other households in the state.\nDuke Energy, which supplies electricity for the state, had been depositing the ash created by burning coal into 32 pits throughout the state for decades. Coal ash contains radioactive materials and heavy metals; when it’s deposited into the pits, which are often unlined ponds, contaminants seep into the groundwater, through the local water system pipes, and from there make their way into people’s taps, water glasses, and bodies.\nIn the film From the Ashes, a Bloomberg Philanthropies-produced documentary that premiered last month, we see Graham hauling 24-packs of bottled water into her home to drink and cook with, while waging an advocacy battle against Duke Energy, demanding that the utility shell out the tens of millions it will take to clean up the water supply.\nGraham’s situation is far from unique. The Environmental Working Group’s updated Tap Water Database aggregated data from 2010 to 2015 from 50,000 utilities across all 50 states, and found traces of over 250 contaminants. Over 160 of those contaminants are unregulated, which means that despite their known adverse health effects, there’s no law limiting their presence in water supplies.\nAnyone can access the database, enter their zip code, and see a list of utilities that serve their area, as well as the contaminants found in their water. While the Environmental Protection Agency sets legal limits, measured in parts per billion (ppb) on a handful of chemicals, like chloroform and trichloroacetic acid (both known carcinogens); under those regulations, water utilities must comply with a certain level of contamination or face a fine. But legal limits, Leiba says, are not necessarily health-protective limits. “They’re a compromise between health, cost, and feasibility,” she says. What the EWG has done with this update of the Tap Water Database is to develop and establish what they’re calling “EWG standards,” which reflect truly health-protective limits. “So for nitrates, we’re not looking at 10 ppb, which is the legal limit; we’re looking at how many people are affected by levels over 5 ppb, which could be cancerous,” Leiba says.\nNitrates are among the most common contaminants in the EWG database; the researchers detected high levels of the chemical",

Other common culprits, also found in all 50 states, include chromium-6, a pervasive carcinogen that leaks into water from industrial waste sites, and lead, the excessive presence of which in Flint, Michigan’s water ignited a national outcry.\nBut the database, for the most part, steers clear of sweeping generalizations about trends in the national water supply, but Leiba notes that contamination levels tend to rise as incomes lower. In the 79406 zip code of Lubbock, Texas, where the per-capita household income is $2,905, EWG found 12 contaminants above the health limit; in Manalapan, Florida (not coincidentally, not far from Mar-A-Lago), the per-capital income is $143,729, and just two contaminants were detected.",

The legal limit for hexavalent chromium is 0.07 ppb, but the EWG standard is 0.02 ppb.\nThe EWG’s database is the most comprehensive of its kind, but it’s not the only one. The Environmental Working Group and other environmental groups have been working hard to convince the EPA to set stricter standards for water contaminants and to enforce the Clean Water Act, which was passed in 1972 and is designed to protect water quality and",

Chloroform, a known carcinogen, was detected in 28 percent of the samples, and 1,000 utilities exceeded the EWG standard of 0. You can see the full list of contaminants and their EWG standards here.\nThe EWG’s database is a great tool for consumers to use to find out what’s in their water, but it’s also a great tool for legislators to use to advocate for better regulations. Unfortunately, the EPA has been slow to regulate contaminants, and the Trump administration has been even slower.

For example, in a water utility that only filters out chlorine, you’ll see chlorine listed as a contaminant. In the same utility that also filters out chloroform, you won’t see chloroform as a contaminant. This allows consumers to know what they should be asking their local utility to filter out, and what their local utility should be doing already.\nIn addition to providing a comprehensive list of contaminants, the database also provides a breakdown of the contaminants found in each utility’s water by the type of treatment the water undergoes.

However, lead is not regulated by the EPA; the only federal law governing its presence in water is the 1986 Lead and Copper Rule, which sets a goal of reducing the amount of lead leaching out of pipes and plumbing fixtures to 15 parts per billion. Yet the EWG found that in 2010, 21 percent of the samples they tested had lead levels above 15 ppb, and that in 2015, 25 percent of the samples had lead levels above 15 ppb.\nIn the 2010-2015 time period, the EPA found that utilities in 43 states had violated the Lead and Copper Rule. Eight states had at least 50 percent of the samples they tested violate the rule: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, and New Jersey. For the 2010",

PG&E was forced to pay $333 million in a settlement.

        "prompt": "Can football ever make you happy?\nCompared to when their team wins, how much sadder is the average football fan when their team loses?\nSo, does football make us happy or sad?\nProfessor Peter Dalton, who by the way supports Newcastle, has been studying football and happiness. Using an app called Mappiness, his team asked fans to rate how they were feeling out of a hundred before and after a game. They analysed two million responses from 32,000 people.\nThis is probably the most comprehensive dataset ever collected on happiness. You're twice as unhappy when your team loses as you are happy when your team wins. On average, it makes us sad and on the face of it, it's (a) pretty irrational thing to do - to be a football fan.

        "prompt": "It's only the Super Bowl of the running world, NBD.\nThe Boston Marathon is the oldest marathon in the United States. It's also one of the World Marathon Majors, a series of six of the largest and most renowned marathons in the world. That should be enough to land it on any runner's bucket list. The fact that Marathon Monday is one of the biggest, rowdiest block parties in the running world, whether you're racing or not? Well, that's just an added bonus.\nWhen Is the Boston Marathon?\nThe Boston Marathon has always been held on Patriot's Day, a holiday commemorating the start of the Revolutionary War (it's only recognized in Massachusetts and Maine, which is why you've probably never heard of it and definitely don't have the day off work if you don't live in those states).\nWhen the race was first founded, Patriot's Day was always celebrated on April 19, so that's when the race was held (unless the 19th fell on a Sunday; then, the race was held Monday the 20th). But in 1969, the holiday—and the race—was officially moved to the third Monday in April. Hence, every Bostonian's favorite holiday: #MarathonMonday.\nIn 2019, the race will take place on April 15.\nHow Many People Run the Boston Marathon?\nIn 1897, there were just 15 runners; by the Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996, the race established a record as the world's largest marathon with 35,868 finishers.\nBut in 2015, the B.A.A. set the field size at 30,000 official entrants and has maintained that cap since. So while it's one of the most prestigious marathons, it isn't the largest. (For comparison's sake, the New York City Marathon set a new world record with 52,812 finishers in 2018).\nBesides the runners, though, around 500,000 spectators line the streets of Boston and its suburbs (especially near colleges like Wellesley, Boston College, and Boston University) each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Sorry, Tom Brady.\nFYI, spectators: The Boston Marathon even has its own beer. 26.2 Brew—a golden, hazy ale brewed with Himalayan sea salt and coriander—was created by Advanced Cicerone Shelley Smith with running champs Meb Keflezighi and Desiree Linden (who will defend her Boston Marathon title on April 15). The beer, which has been available for the past seven years during the Boston Marathon, is now on sale nationwide.\nThe majority of people who run the marathon have qualified to be there. Qualifying standards were introduced in 1970, with the official B.A.A. entry form stating, \"A runner must submit the certification...that he has trained sufficiently to finish the course in less than four hours.\"\nPeople have been getting significantly faster in recent years, though, and more people have qualified than there are spots available. While there are 30,000 bibs up for grabs, just 80 percent of those are for qualifiers; the other 20 percent are reserved for charity entrants (more on that in a sec).\nDue to the increased number of qualifiers in the past few years, the B.A.A. recently announced qualifying standards will be five minutes faster for all age groups, starting with the 2020 Boston Marathon.\nBut a BQ time still doesn't guarantee entry—you actually have to run faster than the specified qualifying time for your age group and gender given the fact that so many other people are out there qualifying.\nYou can typically register in mid-September for the following April's marathon, but you'll have to have run your BQ time before then. (To register for the 2020 race, for example, you would have had to run your qualifying race before September 15, 2018.) Registration is on a rolling schedule; people who qualified by 20 minutes or more go first, then people who qualified by 10 minutes or more, and so on—as long as there's space left.\nWhat If I Can't Qualify for the Boston Marathon?\nYou can still run it! The B.A.A. saves 20 percent of race bibs for charities, sponsors, vendors, municipal officials, local running clubs, and so on. But the easiest way to get in is through one of the organization's charity partners, like Back On My Feet, 261 Fearless, or the American Red Cross.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Course Like?\nThe Boston Marathon course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston—so, technically, you aren't actually running in Boston proper until around mile 24. The point to point route passes through eight cities and towns, including Hopkinton, Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston.\nThe best runners in the world race the Boston Marathon course, but it's actually not officially a world record-qualifying course. The International Association of Athletic Federations sets standards for these kind of races, and the Boston Marathon misses the mark for a couple reasons: 1) It's a race from point A to point B, which could give runners a wind advantage, since they're only running in one direction, and 2) its elevation changes are too steep.\nIt's those elevation changes that make the Boston Marathon one of the most difficult of the World Marathon Majors. The first half of the course is mostly downhill (any BM veteran will warn you not to go out too fast), and runners actually drop 459 feet over the whole course.\nBut the second half is where the course will crush you: The four \"Newton hills\" start at the 16-mile mark, and those back-to-back climbs can feel brutal on tired legs. Not to mention, those hills culminate in the infamous Heartbreak Hill, a 0.4-mile climb between the 20- and 21-mile marks. It's only an 88-foot vertical change, but it comes right as many marathoners hit the dreaded \"wall.\"\nThe last five miles are mostly downhill again, and Boston proper is home to the most famous turn in running—a right on Hereford out of Kenmore Square followed by a quick left on Boylston Street to run the final four blocks to the finish line at Copley Plaza, right next to the Boston Public Library.\nThe Boston Marathon has actually had four finish lines over the years: the Irvington Oval, a track in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood; Exeter Street between Boylston and St. James Streets; Ring Road, a service road parallel to Boylston Street in front of the Prudential Center; and its current location on Boylston between Exeter and Dartmouth streets. Today's finish line—at Copley Plaza, right next to the Boston Public Library—was chosen in 1985, when John Hancock Financial Services started sponsoring the race.\nBesides the moving finish line, the rest of the course has pretty much stayed exactly the same for nearly 100 years",
        "outputs": {
            "baseline": ". In 1897, though, the course was actually only 24.5 miles long—from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the Irvington Oval in Boston. That was based on the 1896 Olympic marathon distance of 24.8 miles; it wasn't until 1924 that the distance was standardized for all future Olympic marathons at 42 kilometers (26 miles, 385 yards) and the start line moved back to Hopkinton.\nHow Can I Watch the Boston Marathon?\nEven if you're not in Boston, you can still catch all the action. NBCSN and NBCSN Gold will start airing race day coverage on Monday at 8:30 a.m. through 1 p.m. ET.\nSpectators watching live or on TV can track runners through the B.A.A.'s mobile app, which is free for iPhone users in the Apple app store and for Android users in Google Play. The app sends out push notifications with updates for your runners every 5K.",
            "llm_baseline": ". The only major change was in 2013, when the race was moved from its traditional Patriots' Day date to April 15 due to the Boston Marathon bombing.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Weather Like?\nThe Boston Marathon is notorious for its unpredictable weather. It's been held in everything from a snowstorm to a heat wave, and the temperature has ranged from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 89 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature is 45 degrees Fahrenheit, but it's been as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit and as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe weather is also a big reason why the Boston Marathon is so difficult. The course is mostly downhill, so it's easy to go out too fast and get caught in the cold or heat. And the hills in the second half of the race can be brutal if you're not prepared for them.\nThe Boston Marathon is also notorious for its wind. The course is exposed to the elements, and the wind can be a big factor in how",

The only major change was in 2013, when the race was forced to start in Hopkinton High School's parking lot instead of the town common due to a gas leak.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Like?\nThe Boston Marathon is a marathon, so it's not exactly a party. But it's also not a race you can just show up to and run without training. It's a big deal, and it's not for the faint of heart.\nBut if you're looking for a marathon that's as much about the experience as the race, this one's for you. The atmosphere is unmatched, and the race is a marathoner's dream. It's a bucket list race for a reason.\nThe Boston Marathon is also one of the most historic and well-known marathons in the world. It's the oldest marathon in the United States and the third oldest in the world (after the Athens Marathon and the Great North Run in the U.K.). The Boston Marathon is also",
            "llm_acro_medium": ". And that's a good thing, because the Boston Marathon is one of the most historic races in the world.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon's History?\nThe Boston Marathon was founded in 1897 by John Graham, Jr., a Boston lawyer and former Harvard University student. He was inspired by the Olympic marathon at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and wanted to bring the race to the United States.\nThe first Boston Marathon was held on April 19, 1897, and was originally called the American Marathon. Participants had to pay a $1 entry fee, and the race was open to anyone who wanted to run it. Runners had to be at least 18 years old and had to be able to run the entire distance without stopping.\nThe first Boston Marathon was won by John J. Pell, who finished in 2:55:10. Only 15 runners finished the race, and the winner received a silver cup and a $150 prize. Graham's",
            "llm_redgreen_medium": ". In 2018, the B.A.A. did change the start line location in Hopkinton to accommodate the growing number of runners (the course is only 26.2 miles, not 26.2 miles plus 385 yards, like most other marathons), but the start line is still on Main Street, just a few blocks from the start line used since 1924.\nWhen Does the Boston Marathon Start?\nThe 2019 Boston Marathon will start at 8:40 a.m. on April 15. That's a little later than the 2018 start time of 8:40 a.m., which was the earliest start time in race history.\nThe first wave of runners will start at 8:40 a.m., with a one-minute gap between waves. Wave 1 will be elite athletes and wheelchair competitors; Wave 2 will be elite athletes and wheelchair competitors; Wave 3 will be elite athletes and wheelchair competitors; Wave 4 will be",

Annual Report from 1927 even includes a map of the course, which is pretty much the same as the one used today.\nWhat's the Boston Marathon Like?\nThe Boston Marathon is a marathon, so it's not exactly a party. No one is really going to be cheering you on for running mile 10, and you definitely won't be getting a lot of high-fives. Just a lot of people watching and a lot of people running.\nBut the Boston Marathon is also a marathon, so it's not exactly a party.

            "llm_senso_redgreen_medium": ". In the 1950s, the B.A.A. considered moving the start to Hopkinton State Park, and the start was even moved to Wellesley College for one race in 1953 due to a fuel shortage, but the start remained at the Town Common until the 1980s, when they decided to move it to the Town Common and Hopkinton State Park, where it remains today.\nWhen Does the Boston Marathon Start?\nThe elite athletes start at 10 a.m., but the rest of the runners leave Hopkinton between 10:00 a.m. and 10:20 a.m., depending on their pace. The first wave leaves at 9:50 a.m., with a pace of 3:45 to 4:00 per mile; the last wave leaves at 10:20 a.m., with a pace of 5:45 to 6:00 per mile.

        "prompt": "Katie shot this photo of Tim (that's me) on the summit of Tunnel Mountain. By the way, there's no tunnel on Tunnel Mountain. Long story.\nWe headed to Banff National Park from our lodge (not ours, just visiting) in Canmore. According to something Katie read, Banff is the No. 1 vacation destination in Canada, and it’s easy to see why. It seems like everywhere you look, there’s a stunning mountain range or a stunning waterfall or a stunning lake or a stunning castle-like hotel, or a stunning combination of the above. And in the middle is the town of Banff, a larger, even livelier version of Canmore. We walked around town — had lunch at a downstairs cafe in which the sandwiches cost around $13 (it’s amazing how expensive everything is, including the gas) and later sampled beers at a cool pub, the Grizzly Paw — but spent even more time driving around with Katie seeking out the natural attractions. And, I must admit, every one was pretty astonishing.\nWe stopped at one waterfall and looked up and saw nestled upon a hill the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, which was built in the 1880s and looks like something out of a glamorous 1940s movie (“Why, look, there’s Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh! And isn’t the Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine strolling behind them?”) We hiked (that word!) up the hill, got in through a back door and checked out the establishment. It was fairly empty (I imagine the guests were out doing things), which made giant common areas seem that much larger. If the Downton Abbey folks were visiting Banff, this is where they’d stay.\nAfter a brief inspection, Katie and I went back outdoors on the hotel grounds and sat in Adirondack chairs facing — What else? — a beautiful view below us. Some of my favorite moments on this trip have been when Katie and I have just sat somewhere outside, relaxed and talked. This was one of those moments, as Katie explained to me the criteria for a listing in the U.S. National Register (which is related to her work). I shouldn’t be surprised by her accumulation of knowledge, given her education and experience, but it gives me such pleasure to listen to her speak with such (modest) authority on such things. She’s as obsessed with her vocation as I am with mine.\nWe had two similar experiences this day. One was when we sat on the curbing of a footpath overlooking a valley and we",

The second was when we sat at the summit of Tunnel Mountain with scattered groups of one, two, three or four hikers who had walked the mile-long trail to the top. Again, we were in the sun, this time overlooking the town of Banff and the surrounding area far, far below. We didn’t talk much — I was too tired from the climb, though it wasn’t nearly as bad as my recent hike from hell. (Barely a wheeze came out of me, though I did have to stop to catch my breath now and then.) By the end, sitting on the summit, I actually felt pretty good. Besides, the view made conversation seem unnecessary.\nKatie and I finished the day by sharing a frozen cheese pizza we cooked in the kitchenette of our room back in Canmore. It was delicious.",

And I’m always looking for a way to make my own life more interesting. I’m not sure I’ve found the answer to any of those questions, but I’m still looking.\nWe drove to Lake Louise, which is a 40-minute drive from Banff. It’s a beautiful lake, but it’s also a very popular tourist destination, so it was crowded. We walked around the lake, which is surrounded by mountains, and then we walked up a hill to the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, which is a hotel that looks like something out of a glamorous 1940",

        "prompt": "“ƒ”¹…”The more you bash Sri Lanka, the better off the Tamils are’. This is the guiding principle of the Tamil Diaspora, UNHRC headed by a Tamil, India controlled by Tamil political parties, manyfold Tamil NGOs abroad and in Sri Lanka, Tamil political parties in Sri Lanka and Tamil civil activists in Sri Lanka. The government of President Rajapaksa keeps appeasing Tamils. What it doesn’t realize is there will never be an end to Sri Lanka bashing if such bashing producers results for the bashers. A local saying goes, only a tree full of fruits get stoned, a barren tree will not be stoned. This is more applicable to Sri Lanka than any other country. It is high time the government understood this modus operandi and approach it accordingly.\nConventional war is about testing the military and political superiority of the parties. However, terrorism is completely different. In terrorism, the objective is to gain as much as possible from a government. There are two well co-ordinated claws in all terrorist operations. One is a hard one that carries out acts of terror forcing terrified governments and people to seek protection and peace. Then comes the soft arm of terrorism. It reassures the terrified people and the government and offers “ƒ”¹…”solution’. This “ƒ”¹…”solution’ is nothing but a highly disadvantageous position for the terrified people and the government. It is all about extortion. Once the extorted favour is obtained, the hard claw (terrorist group) scales down attacks temporarily. However, their attacks resume after a while. The cycle continues. Terrified people lose more and more while terrorist people gain more and more. It is this cycle that is known as terrorism.\nIn the Sri Lankan case the hard claw of terrorism comprised of the LTTE, EROS, TELO (military wing) and today it is made up of GTF, TFO, BTF, UNHRC and Tamil Nadu. The soft claw of terrorism is made up of TULF, Jehan Perera, CPA, TNA, UNHRC, India and western imperialists.\nDespite the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, terrorism continues through other Tamil actors.\nThe vicious cycle of threats, extortion, gratification and threats again needs to be broken to save the nation. It cannot be done by giving into Tamil demands hoping the demand will end. On the contrary, they increase with every successful demand. Instead a cap or a stop must be put to Tamil demands. Once the terror operators are convinced their demands fall on deaf ears, they are forced to give up gradually.\nTamils have a choice of extortion targets including Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Canada, Australia, etc. However, only Sri Lanka has been playing according to their expectations and as a result they have been concentrating only on Sri Lanka. When the government of Sri Lanka stops giving into Tamil demands, they will be forced to seek their demands elsewhere. Dravidistan demand was cut down by India in 1930s for the first time, 1947 for the second time and almost entirely in 1962 which pushed the Tamil national struggle to Sri Lanka. Tamils must be convinced Sri Lanka is not their paradise.\nTamils have cleverly exploited this temporary geopolitical goldmine in their favour.\nAt the moment geopolitics of the region is highly disadvantageous to Sri Lanka. The US-India axis is on a rampage intimidating all regional countries and China. There is a respite in terrorist threats on western interests which has given them more time to concentrate on human rights. However, it is fast changing. A definitive change is due after December 2014. NATO troops will substantially leave Afghanistan conceding defeat in December 2014 leaving a very weak Afghan security force to battle a rejuvenated Taliban. The terrorist group has already shifted gears anticipating the 2014 retreat. NATO troops have no future in Afghanistan as they are substantially leaving in another two years and the only challenge will be the Afghan army which is now taking a massive beating. Although NATO casualties have decreased after the announcement of the withdrawal plan, there is a corresponding and huge increase in Afghan troop casualties. How long can the weak Afghan troops last? Not very long as popular sentiment is rising against them from within. All the freedoms, democracy and security assurances “ƒ”¹…”won’ by NATO will be buried by January 2015.\nHowever, the withdrawal poses a massive security threat to western interests. Just because the NATO troops withdraw, the war will not stop. In fact the Taliban will be back in the west with a vengeance. NATO is now seeking help from India and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to intervene in the war torn country trying to contain the terrorists. India tries to pass the responsibility to SCO. It is unthinkably stupid for the SCO to assume this needless menace created by the west. Afghanistan or the Taliban is not the responsibility of the SCO. In fact, this potent terror group can be a strategic asset of the SCO against western hegemony. Hopeful of India’s positive response, USA props up India with every way it can. USA and its allies changed their decades old policy of not supplying nuclear materials to India. Western weapons are free flowing to India now. Kashmir and other horrendous Indian war crimes are forgotten by the west, for now.\nLate 2009 Robert Blake made a request to the Lankan Defence Secretary to send troops to Afghanistan as the war has ended which was put down citing unrest among local Muslims. It came with a warning “”…” unless Sri Lanka agrees, USA will bring war crimes allegations against the island nation. The US Possible War Crimes Report was released following the refusal to supply troops. Repeated requests were made with no positive outcome. Similar requests were made from India. Instead of an outright denial, India has been relaying mixed signals. Reluctantly it agreed to train the Afghan troops and police. However, India is pressurised to make a firm troop commitment in Afghanistan before the NATO troops leave in 2014. India now tries to convince SCO to “ƒ”¹…”play a bigger role’ in post-2014 Afghanistan. It is a ridiculous demand as India is only an observer state in the SCO, not a full member! Besides the SCO is not a military organisation.\nDuring the time of the last UNP government (2001-2004), Sri Lanka was among 54 countries that participated in a global network of involuntary disappearances, torture, murder and other human rights abuses led by the USA. Unarmed Muslim civilians were tortured and unlawful restrained under these activities in 2003. It created a rift between the then UNF government and its Muslim ally “”…” SLMC. In the same year Sri Lanka was instructed not to sign the Rome Statute Against Torture by the US network so that the country can remain a torture hub of the US network. For this reason, USA now wants a regime change in Sri Lanka which will bring back the UNP which interoperated with the USA on the global torture campaign. USA is hopeful if the UNP comes to power it will send Lankan troops to fight in Afghanistan. Although the 2001-2004 UNP contribution to the global torture network had minimal domestic effects, a troop commitment to Afghanistan will be cataclysmic. In short, the war in Afghanistan will come home to Colombo.\nDuring many US military operations, Pakistan played a key role. But that mistake condemned them to total ruination. Today even the US attacks Pakistan with drones! Going to Afghanistan is such an unwise approach despite strong American influence to do so.\nIf India falls into this inducement, chaos will rule the world’s largest democracy. Logistical advantages of closer proximity, large unused armed forces, excess capacity of Indian troops, battle experience for Indian troops, US-EU military support to upgrade Indian weapons, concessionary weapons purchases from the US-EU and other sweeteners are not sufficient for India to go to war in Afghanistan. Large scale violence, explosions, attacks and disruptions will derail India if it goes to war. Therefore, India will have to reject the US proposal. Although Indian has been successful in buying time, the clock is ticking as December 2014 approaches fast. Sooner rather than later, USA will demand troops from India. That is when the US-India honeymoon will end.\nIt is better for USA to help disintegration of India as it will give the west more options. Smaller nations, like in former Soviet nations or former Yugoslav nations, will be friendlier with USA in return for protection, favourable trade concessions and geopolitical advantage. As such, when India refuses to play by US rules on Afghanistan, etc., USA will disintegrate India. Indian disintegration will be highly beneficial to India’s neighbours as they could engage with these smaller nations on an equal footing in the absence of the bully. The process itself will be beneficial as it will bring them many global advantages.\nNo one can save Sri Lanka from suicide, if its leaders prefer it . Not giving into 2012 UNHRC demands was a brave move by the administration. Hopefully defiance in the face of foreign threats will continue in 2013 as well. The government must follow a broader approach with a longer time span. As the current geopolitical impasse will pass in another 20 months’ time, Sri Lanka must not hurry into any US, India or UNHRC demand. Tamils in Sri Lanka have equal rights (equal individual rights) and they deserve nothing more. Giving too much rights to Tamils will inflate Tamils into a community of geopolitical clout in the region which is a disaster. Give into no Tamil demand and wait out till the dark clouds of the current geopolitical impasse pass over. The party that can withstand and persevere for the longest, wins this war raged at the UNHRC.\nWe don’t wish the UNHRC majority to vote against the anti-Sri Lanka resolution. We don’t challenge their free choice. But we all wish the Sri Lankan government to totally disregard the two UNHRC resolutions against Sri Lanka and continue its good work to assimilate all Sri Lankans into one nationality.\nDisregard of the 2012 UNHRC resolution pushed it to the rubbish bin of history. Now USA brings another resolution. That too will end in the same bin if the government wisely continues its disregard for UNHRC impositions.\nOne belongs to the other. Fullstop!\nAlthough I understand THE sentiment expressed by S deSilva, my approach is slightly different. We need to understand Indian politics and should be able to communicate with non Tamils. At the moment Tamils have influenced the Government and the racists in TN have won. Unless we are prepared to defend ourselves, we will be vulnerable. Appeasing Tamils will not help us. Unless, the Sinhalse safeguard Lanka, our future generations of Sinhalese will not have a home land. To defend our country, we should be able to think straight. We cannot do that if we blindly follow Buddhism with unproven myths. Further Buddhism does not promote achievement or even self preservation. We should really question if it is worthwhile blindly following Buddhism. We need to get a broader picture of the world. For that we need to free our mind from myths.\nOK. Lets have a scenario.\nSL tells non-Tamilian Indians “SL is doing good”.\nTN Tamilians tell non-Tamilian Indians “SL rapes Tamils”. (This actually happened yesterday in Indian parliament).\nWhat will the non-Tamilian Indians will FINALLY believe?\n1. Because if they don’t, DMK, etc. will vote AGAINST them in parliament! DMK will start their rowdy violence. DMK, etc. will do anti-Indian things MORE. DMK, etc. have parliamentary REPRESENTATION in India and we don’t.\n2. Because the ONLY Indians in SL are Tamilians.\nSo SL can NEVER communicate SUCCESSFULLY to non-Tamilian Indians. They believe what they want to believe. They do what is good for them politically, not SL.\nTamils = India = Tamils.\nI agree with Lorenzo that Tamils have a strong influence in India.b What it means is that Sinhalese need to improve on Finance, economics and defence. We cannot stay idele and prey for extinction.\nshould be able to communicate with non Tamils- eg: Swamy is doing good job in USA !\nMy advice to Chinhala sakotharayas ,invite these Bramin Swamy/ So to colombo give them what they want ( not money they have enogh in their swiss bank a/c ) from our velokada jail (who surrendered in may 2009 ) than they will look after you !!!\nTHESE WORDS OF WISDOM NEED TO BE ADHERED TO ON THE BASIS THAT ~ if there was something tangible towards holding Sri Lanka accountable other than through the lop sided accusations based on cooked up ‘evidence’ that cannot be substantiated the world authorities at the Hague and elsewhere would have already pounced on it big time.",

        "prompt": "TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) — The photocopies of the manual lay in heaps on the floor, in stacks that scaled one wall, like Xeroxed, stapled handouts for a class.\nExcept that the students in this case were al-Qaida fighters in Mali. And the manual was a detailed guide, with diagrams and photographs, on how to use a weapon that particularly concerns the United States: A surface-to-air missile capable of taking down a commercial airplane.\nThe 26-page document in Arabic, recovered by The Associated Press in a building that had been occupied by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu, strongly suggests the group now possesses the SA-7 surface-to-air missile, known to the Pentagon as the Grail, according to terrorism specialists. And it confirms that the al-Qaida cell is actively training its fighters to use these weapons, also called man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, which likely came from the arms depots of ex-Libyan strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi.\nEDITOR'S NOTE — This is the fourth story in an occasional series based on thousands of pages of internal al-Qaida documents recovered by The Associated Press earlier this year in Timbuktu, Mali.\n\"The existence of what apparently constitutes a 'Dummies Guide to MANPADS' is strong circumstantial evidence of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb having the missiles,\" said Atlantic Council analyst Peter Pham, a former adviser to the United States' military command in Africa and an instructor to U.S. Special Forces. \"Why else bother to write the guide if you don't have the weapons? ... If AQIM not only has the MANPADS, but also fighters who know how to use them effectively,\" he added, \"then the impact is significant, not only on the current conflict, but on security throughout North and West Africa, and possibly beyond.\"\nThe United States was so worried about this particular weapon ending up in the hands of terrorists that the State Department set up a task force to track and destroy it as far back as 2006. In the spring of 2011, before the fighting in Tripoli had even stopped, a U.S. team flew to Libya to secure Gadhafi's stockpile of thousands of heat-seeking, shoulder-fired missiles.\nThe manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by Osama bin Laden. It adds to evidence for the weapon found by French forces during their land assault in Mali earlier this year, including the discovery of the SA-7's battery pack and launch tube, according to military statements and an aviation official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment.\nThe knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the French are carrying out their five-month-old offensive in Mali. They are using more fighter jets rather than helicopters to fly above its range of 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) from the ground, even though that makes it harder to attack the jihadists. They are also making cargo planes land and take off more steeply to limit how long they are exposed, in line with similar practices in Iraq after an SA-14 hit the wing of a DHL cargo plane in 2003.\nAnd they have added their own surveillance at Mali's international airport in Bamako, according to two French aviation officials and an officer in the Operation Serval force. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.\nFirst introduced in the 1960s in the Soviet Union, the SA-7 was designed to be portable. Not much larger than a poster tube, it can be packed into a duffel bag and easily carried. It's also affordable, with some SA-7s selling for as little as $5,000.\nThe SA-7 is an old generation model, which means most military planes now come equipped with a built-in protection mechanism against it. But that's not the case for commercial planes, and the threat is greatest to civilian aviation.\n\"This is not a 'Fire and forget' weapon,\" said Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. \"There's a paradox here. One the one hand it's not easy to use, but against any commercial aircraft there would be no defenses against them. It's impossible to protect against it. ... If terrorists start training and learn how to use them, we'll be in a lot of trouble.\"\nIn Timbuktu, SA-7 training was likely part of the curriculum at the 'Jihad Academy' housed in a former police station, said Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for Training and Analysis of Terrorism, one of three experts who reviewed the manual for AP. It's located less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Ministry of Finance's Budget Division building where the manual was found.\nAs the jihadists fled ahead of the arrival of French troops who liberated Timbuktu on Jan. 28, they left the manual behind, along with other instructional material, including a spiral-bound pamphlet showing how to use the KPV-14.5 anti-aircraft machine gun and another on how to make a bomb out of ammonium nitrate, among other documents retrieved by the AP. Residents said the jihadists grabbed reams of paper from inside the building, doused them in fuel and set them alight. The black, feathery ash lay on top of the sand in a ditch just outside the building's gate.\n\"They just couldn't destroy everything,\" said neighbor Mohamed Alassane. \"They appeared to be in a panic when the French came. They left in a state of disorder.\"\nIts pages are numbered 313 through 338, suggesting they came from elsewhere. Mathieu Guidere, an expert on Islamic extremists at the University of Toulouse, believes the excerpts are lifted from the Encyclopedia of Jihad, an 11-volume survey on the craft of war first compiled by the Taliban in the 1980s and later codified by Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, who led a contingent of Arab fighters in Afghanistan at the time, paid to have the encyclopedia translated into Arabic, according to Guidere, author of a book on al-Qaida's North African branch.\nHowever, the cover page of the manual boasts the name of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.\n\"It's a way to make it their own,\" said Guidere. \"It's like putting a logo on something. ... It shows the historic as well as the present link between al",

            "baseline": "-Qaida core and AQIM.\"\nBin Laden later assembled a team of editors to update the manual, put it on CD-ROMs and eventually place it on the Internet, in a move that lay the groundwork for the globalization of jihad, according to terrorism expert Jarret Brachman, who was the director of research at the Combating Terrorism Center when the al-Qaida encyclopaedia was first found.\nN.R. Jenzen-Jones, an arms expert in Australia, confirmed that the information in the manual in Timbuktu on the missile's engagement range, altitude and weight appeared largely correct. He cautions though that the history of the SA-7 is one of near-misses, specifically because it takes training to use.\nAssociated Press writer Lori Hinnant contributed to this report from Paris, and AP journalist Amir Bibawy translated the document.

        "prompt": "ForexNewsNow – The fluctuation in the price of an ounce of gold this past week were closely linked to the ups and downs of the most traded currency pair, the EUR/USD, and show just how well the values of each financial asset impact each other’s pricing.\nAs doubts on the stability of the euro zone reached new heights last week over concerns about a Greek default, the euro stabilized around 1.3700 before gaining further ground against the greenback and closing the trading week at around 1.3800. Political events had a direct impact on the financial markets as the meeting of EU financial officials in Poland showed.\nHere is an analysis of the symbiosis between XAU/USD and EUR/USD during this past week.\nThe EUR/USD pair experienced serious turbulence on Monday, due to the viral uncertainty in the markets. The higher the doubts on EU stability, the quicker investors rush towards safe havens such as gold. Conversely, as soon as the euro regains strength, interest in gold wanes.\nDespite the euro’s stabilizing around 1.3700, XAU/USD increased in value. Analysts were anticipating a decrease in the value of the euro. Thus, we can see that the XAU/USD is an excellent indicator of investor confidence in the EU’s single currency.\nThe euro gained ground against the dollar on Wednesday, moving above 1.3750. And as an immediate consequence, gold started losing value.\nThe EU central banks meeting in Poland allowed the EU to reassure investors somewhat",

Following these announcements, the euro sharply increased against the US dollar and gold lost ground in relative terms.\nDoubt came back to the euro zone slightly weakening the EU’s single currency against the greenback, allowing gold to recover from its losses on Thursday. US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s comments on the euro debt crisis also showed that the cooperation between the US and the EU may also impact forex and gold markets.\nOverall, this past week underlined how the values of EUR/USD and XAU/USD are linked one to another. This relationship can both elucidate how weak the euro is against the dollar and help anticipate investors’ propensity to flee to safe haven assets.\nThe upward trend in Gold that we have been observing for months now testifies to the lack of confidence in both the euro and US dollar.

The overall property also includes 5.3 acres to be dedicated as open space.\nIf developed, a public 20-foot wide multi-use trail would also be provided, which would run parallel to Franklin Road and allow for connections to future city trails.\nA public hearing is scheduled for the rezoning on Aug. 13, and will be up for final reading on Aug. 27.",

Andrew Zuppann of the University of Houston, along with Yona Rubinstein of the London School of Economics, suggests that the more children a family has, the less likely those children will have a good life.\n\"Using a variety of approaches we have documented a significant trade-off between quantity and quality of children for NLSY mothers and their children,\" their new study said. \"On average, children in larger families have lowered parental investment and worse cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes.\"\nUsing data from 1986 to 2012 taken by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and by the Children and Young Adult Survey, the researchers were able to match the number and timing of births into a family to a number of mental and behavioral traits.\nAdditionally, they were able to measure parental engagement with children, such as time spent with each child.\nThey found that in families with more children, parents engaged with each child less. This corresponded with higher likelihoods of poor outcomes for the kids.\n\"Our fixed effect estimates indicate that the arrival of a younger sibling reduces measures of parental investment as well as cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes of older children by approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation,\" the researchers said.\nThe effects were different for girls and boys. Whereas girls typically saw a larger negative effect on cognitive abilities, boys had worse outcomes behaviorally.\nOn top of that, the researchers found that over time children didn't grow out of the negative effects.\n\"Not only do we fail to find evidence that the impact is transitory, effects appear to substantially worsen over the longer run,\" they said. \"Test scores and parental investments are both worse over the longer horizon than in the short run. Only in behavioral problems do we find that",

            "baseline": " the effects may dissipate over the longer run.\"\nAdditionally, economic well being of the mother and even the mother's intelligence, as measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test, were seen as potential factors in the outcomes.\n\"High AFQT mothers of all races appear to face less of a trade-off than mothers with low AFQT scores,\" the study said. \"Differences in mother's AFQT scores are correlated with a wide set of lifestyle differences that could explain these differences. For instance, having worse child care coverage, maternity policies, or flexibility in household labor supply could all make the presence of an additional child more detrimental to other children in the household.\"\nThough the researchers warn that further study would be needed to make a causal link between any of these factors to the worse outcomes, the correlations between the number of children and negative life outcomes were significant.\nBased on the study, it seems that contrary to the popular saying, more may not be merrier.",

        "prompt": "DANVILLE, Va. – Only days after the Machinists union petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for an election to see if a majority of workers want a union at Swedwood Danville, an IKEA furniture maker, the company has rigged the process against its workers.\nIKEA agreed this week to an election date of July 27, but only after adding 30 “team captains” to the voting pool, bringing the total in the pool to 318.\nAccording to William Street, the lead organizer at the plant for the International Association of Machinists, the move adds 30 “no” votes to the voting pool and means that the union will now have to find an additional 25 supporters in order to offset those votes.\nThe company demanded inclusion of the team captains, the union says, as a condition for setting a “reasonable” July 27 election date. Companies frequently drag out the election date, the union says, so they can run anti-union propaganda campaigns and sometimes harass and even fire union backers before the election.\n“It is ironic that IKEA, which claims it wants everyone to decide for themselves whether to be in the union, decides instead to force the 30 team captains into the unit,” said Street. “There is only one reason for Swedwood to demand the team captains be in the union, and that is to influence the outcome of the election.” Street, in addition to organizing the union’s campaign at the plant, is director of the IAM’s woodworking department.\nIKEA, in an e-mailed response to previous Peoples World articles on the struggle to unionize at Danville, said that it respects its workers right to freedom of association, including their right to join or form unions without fear of reprisal or interference.\n“I guess this doesn’t apply to the Danville workers who do not wish to associate with team captains or team captains who do not wish to associate with the union,” said Street. “It would be interesting to hear how IKEA will defend taking choice away from the workers to decide who they want in their own union,” he added.\nCalls to the company’s public relations office were not returned.\nStreet noted that the IAM was “more than ready” to represent team captains in their own union if they were serious about wanting that representation. “But IKEA has no business interfering in the choice of the hourly non-supervisory workers to have a union of their own choosing,” he declared.\nIncluding the team captains in the voting unit gives IKEA a 10",

He notes that because there are so many built in advantages for the company, union elections are rarely won by more than 10 percent of the vote.\nThe union organizing drive at the Danville plant has been fueled by both low wages and dangerous working conditions. IKEA’s factory workers in Sweden are paid $19 per hour and get five weeks paid vacation every year. At the Danville plant, many earn only $8 an hour.\nWorkers at Danville have suffered more than 1,536 days of lost work due to accidents on the job in a recent 30-month period, according to the union.\nPetitions have been put out on the Internet by Change.org for members of the public who want to support the workers.

It all has been intended to protect government minions and government power.\nThe National Firearms Act of 1934 came in response to the gang violence of the Prohibition era that came about from a misguided ban on alcohol. Armed government minions didn't like having the bad guys — and, by extension, citizens — armed on an equal par.\nEvery legislative action perpetrated by the Democrat-fascists since then has been intended to bolster government power and restrict citizens' right and ability to resist government abuse. No law enacted to restrict firearms freedom over the past 90 years ever has made citizens safer, reduced crime or violence. In fact, such foolishness as gun-free zones has encouraged mass attacks. When politicians want your guns, it's for their safety, not yours.\nCitizens now must resist and work in every way possible and by every means at hand to end the overreach of government and return our nation to the freedom we used to know. Now is the time.\nthe way to describe relationships?\nI have noticed a lot of media, such as the newspaper and television stations, now call spouses, \"partners.\" Is this something to placate the LGBQT movement? When I was married it was, \"I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" not \"partners.\" Please return to normalcy and call it what it is, husband, wife, spouse and if you want for the LGBQT, partners.\nThere is a good reason the founders of our country put the Electoral College in the United States Constitution. And the Democrats in Denver are supposed to be representing us, not throwing our nine votes away.\nDonald Trump won 37 states and Hillary Clinton won 13. And yes, I know Clinton won 3 million more votes than Trump. We are a representative republic. Democrats don't like that.\nI read a letter in The Pueblo Chieftain headlined, “Progressive principles? Calirado, here we come.” The article stated that “progressive ideology is in direct contradiction to American values, the U.S. Constitution, and the principles of liberty our founders and framers painstakingly debated and put into our most honored documents.” The writer blamed progressive-ism for the rise of socialism, communism, fascism and totalitarianism. And he defined democracy as mob rule.\nDictionary.com defines \"progressive\" as favoring or advocating progress, change, improvement or reform, as opposed to wishing to maintain things as they",

So, by definition, the term would appropriately define much of our Founding Fathers’ attitudes and beliefs. Writing the Federalist Papers, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, rebelling against King George and revolting against England epitomized progressive ideology.\nBack in the early 20th century, progressive politicians took on the status quo and won women the right to vote, ended child labor in factories and started the eight-hour workday. Today, racism is flourishing, as are mass shootings and homelessness. Women still don’t receive the same pay as men. Inadequate health care, mass shootings and income inequality plague our society. Progressive is not a bad word and neither is conservative.\nProgressive politicians support sometimes necessary changes in government; conservative politicians balance that by questioning the need for those changes.

Prosecutors dropped a driving under the influence charge for the superstar golfer, and the judge warned him to behave.\n“This particular plea agreement has no jail time on it. However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and then I could sentence you to jail for 90 days with a fine of up to $500, is that understood?” Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo said.\nWoods, 41, nodded. He did not make any statement during the hearing or outside the courthouse.\nWoods will enter a diversion program and spend a year on probation and pay a $250 fine and court costs. He has already met some of the program’s other requirements, completing 50 hours of community service at the Tiger Woods Foundation, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said.\nAronberg didn’t say specifically what Woods did with the charitable group, but said he met the terms of the deal. Woods also attended a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged.\nAronberg said most DUI offenders do not qualify for the diversion program because they have a prior record or were in an accident. About 2,500 first-time offenders have graduated from the county program since it began four years ago.\nSince he was intoxicated with prescription drugs and marijuana, according to court records, he will also be required to undergo regular drug tests. Woods is also not allowed to drink alcohol.\nWoods arrived at the courthouse in a black sport utility vehicle, wearing sunglasses and a dark suit with no tie. Police officers surrounded him as he walked down a hallway inside the courthouse and they ringed the inside of the courtroom during the high-profile proceeding.\nWoods was arrested about 2 a.m. May 29 when officers found him unconscious in his Mercedes, which was parked awkwardly on the roadside and had damage to the driver’s side.\nIt’s not clear how he damaged the car. Officers checked the area but didn’t find that he had hit anything. He was about 15 miles from his home.\nHis arrest was recorded by an officer’s dashcam video and released to the public.\nWoods had",

He has not competed since February because of his back injury and is not expected to return this year. His last win was in August 2013. Woods has said his back is improving.

        "prompt": "Has iPhone 5 Set Back New Credit Card Payment Technologies?\nIf you have a life, you probably haven&apos;t been following the great Apple iPhone 5/Near-Field Communications (NFC) debate. Good for you. But spare a minute to catch up, because it could -- admittedly a few years down the line -- affect the credit cards in your wallet in a big way.\nWhat&apos;s the big deal with NFC?\nAll the big credit card payment networks (American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa) have over the last year published plans for the introduction into the U.S. of \"EMV\" cards, the ones that have onboard microprocessor chips. These \"roadmaps\" have also included provision for NFC, the technology that allows you to wave or tap an enabled card or smart device near a point-of-sale payment terminal instead of going through the usual swiping process. Mastercard&apos;s PayPass and Visa&apos;s payWave already allow this in the relatively small number of merchant outlets that are currently equipped with NFC terminals.\nHowever, in September, Apple released its iPhone 5. And, unlike some smartphones, it does not come with NFC capabilities. This means that the most anticipated new method of payment terminal checkout just got slighted by Apple. The question is why?\nWill Complaints Over iPhone 5’s Map App Hurt Sales?\nCredit card networks charge merchants a swipe or interchange fee every time a card is swiped, waved or tapped by the customer. Credit card swipe fees are already under threat from legislators who&apos;d like to cap them, just as they did on debit cards in 2011. And anyone who&apos;s now paying for what used to be a free checking account can guess what that could mean for their credit cards. Swipe fees are one of credit card companies&apos; biggest revenue streams, and any significant reduction in their flow could see the widespread introduction of annual fees and a slashing of rewards programs.\nIn a Huffington Post article, Brett King states, \"The problem for the [banking/credit card] industry is that right now we&apos;re doing away with the swipe paradigm altogether, primarily because there wasn&apos;t a rapid enough adoption of NFC-enabled payments. We&apos;ve simply circumvented the poor user experience of the swipe card, for a richer user experience on the mobile device.\"\nMerchants now have alternatives to traditional network swipe fees and adopting services, such as Square and PayPal, which avoid the swipe fee entirely. Starbucks, which in August struck a new deal with Square Inc., a payments provider, has for some time operated its own closed-loop, prepaid, mobile payments app that entirely circumvented the current swipe-fee oligopoly. People like Brett King expect that phenomenon to become increasingly common, and for card issuers&apos; revenues from swipe fees to be slowly whittled away.\nThere is, of course, a continuing debate about the pros and cons of swipe fees. In 2009, the value of those collected just by MasterCard and Visa was between $35 billion and $45 billion, according to a Federal Reserve report. Most of that would have been passed on to card issuers.\nMerchants argue that these fees drive up prices in-",

Under this analysis, the poor and unbanked, who have to pay for everything using cash or even food stamps, are subsidizing through these higher prices the free use of plastic and all those rewards credit cards&apos; goodies for much richer folk.\nBanks and credit card companies contend that cutting swipe fees is only going to transfer a big chunk of their incomes to merchants&apos; bottom lines. They say that there&apos;s no evidence that reducing this cost will result in lower prices at the checkout.\nWho knows which argument is correct? But one of these days we may find out. For now, it appears that Apple may be betting mobile wallet apps that include a payment provider will soon be dominating the mobile payment field. Like a good game of leapfrog, Apple could be waiting to hurdle the competition.\nThe original article can be found at IndexCreditCards.com:Has iPhone 5 set back new credit card payment technologies?",

Judging by the number of NFC-enabled smartphones already on the market, it&apos;s unlikely to be a deal-breaker. Let&apos;s face it, not everyone is going to be an iPhone 5 owner.

Ultimately, there are the costs of accepting any form of payment, and the risk of fraud.\nIn the end, there are a number of ways to pay for goods and services, and the credit card swipe fee is only one of them.\nWill NFC ever be adopted?\nThe credit card networks and the credit card companies will continue to push NFC. Retailers, on the other hand, are likely to be slow to adopt it, and will probably only do so when they are forced to, by the credit card networks.\nIn the meantime, there are a number of other technologies that will be adopted more",

That would also be a great boost for Apple. As Brett King pointed out, Apple is the only company in a position to \"drive the adoption of the NFC movement.\"\nWhether or not Apple is interested in doing so remains to be seen.

        "prompt": "Consider this: Regulators such as the Federal Reserve had 48 hours of warning before the fall of AIG. They had 72 hours before the collapse of Bear Stearns. The system's most powerful watchdogs had no idea that the most dangerous firms were ticking time bombs. And as we know, when the bombs went off, they had no idea what to do. Chris Dodd's financial-regulation proposal (pdf) is an effort to make sure they're never caught unaware, or unprepared, again.\nInsofar as Dodd's proposal has a clear theory of the case and its solution, it's this: At every point in the chain of events that led to the financial crisis, there was a crucial information deficit. Consumers didn't understand the products they were buying. Regulators didn't understand the banks they were regulating (and, in some cases, not regulating). There were non-bank players such as AIG that had become central to the system but that few were watching. And no one understood what to do when the banks collapsed. At the most basic level, Dodd's bill is an effort to make sure the absence of information never leads to a financial crisis again. The question is whether that's enough.\nIt's easy to forget that the financial crisis began with one subprime mortgage, sold to one consumer, at a time. That's the argument behind the Consumer Financial Products Bureau. Housed in the Federal Reserve (a significant defeat for advocates), the CFPB will be run by a presidential appointee, funded through a dedicated budget, and empowered to write new rules on its own. Supporters of the initiative -- including Elizabeth Warren, who first came up with the idea -- believe that Dodd's bill retains the CFPB's independence. They worry, however, that housing it in the Federal Reserve means it's only one amendment away from becoming a servant of the Federal Reserve -- and the Fed has a terrible track record regulating consumer products.\nIf it survives, the point of the CFPB, as one supporter explains it, is to \"make contracts comprehensible again.\" That's it. No one expects it to have the power to force companies to offer so-called \"plain vanilla\" products. But if it can bring contracts down to two pages from 10; if it can standardize how these products are presented so people can make informed decisions; if it can end the \"teaser culture\" in which the low initial costs are in bold letters and the dangers are confined to a jargon-filled footnote on page 6; maybe it can do some good.\nBut that's a lot of \"ifs,\" and I should admit my skepticism: Would more prominent disclosure of prepayment penalties and interest hikes have averted the subprime crisis? How do we keep individual brokers from de-emphasizing them?\nWhat might have averted the crisis was regulators who recognized not only the building pressure on bank balance sheets, but the risk that individual firms posed to the entire system. That will be the job of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The FSOC -- which is really fun to say aloud, incidentally -- will be made up of nine federal regulators, one independent appointee, and chaired by the secretary of the Treasury. It will be staffed by a new Office of Financial Research inside the Treasury Department that'll be, at base, a data-gathering operation.\nThe FSOC -- \"fff-SOK!\" -- will be charged with watching banks (think Bank of America) and non-bank actors (think AIG) of systemic importance and making recommendations about what the Federal Reserve should do with them. The council can recommend \"increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management.\" It can bring non-bank entities under the Federal Reserve's regulatory umbrella. Working with the Federal Reserve, it can break up systemically dangerous institutions, or force them to divest themselves of holdings or end certain business practices. But a lot of this is dependent on not just the council's decisions but on the Federal Reserve's agreement.\nIf all works well, the FSOC will alert regulators to problems in systemically important institutions before they threaten to consume the host. But if not, the bill creates an orderly process the FDIC can use to shut down failing institutions. In it, shareholders and unsecured creditors bear losses and management loses their jobs. It also gives them a roadmap for how to do it: Systemically important institutions will have to produce so-called \"funeral plans\" laying out exactly how they could be shut down if it came to that. No more late-night confusion at the Federal Reserve.\nAnd one important proviso to all of this: The derivatives section in the proposal is not the one that will be in Dodd's final bill. It's a placeholder for the derivative-regulation package that Judd Gregg and Jack Reed are working to build. But unless there's transparency in derivatives, there can't be transparency in balance sheets. \"Derivatives reform is intimately tied to the functioning of the entire system,\" says the Roosevelt Institution's Rob Johnson, a former chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee. \"If derivatives reform is done well, it creates clarity in how much capital a firm has and whether they’re impaired or not. In the absence of derivatives reform, everything remains muddy. A lot will live or die around that point.\"\nBut assume the derivatives piece comes out okay. This, then, is the core of the bill. Regulators get more and better information and more and better powers. The question is whether that's a good theory for this legislation. And I don't think it is.\nOne of the lessons of the financial crisis is that you can lead a regulator to information, but you can't make him drink. Imagine a world in which Alan Greenspan helms the Federal Reserve, in which George W. Bush appoints the Treasury Secretary, and in which the consensus is that the data showing we've abandoned historical economic trends are explained away because the sophisticated new products that few understand have effectively hedged away the risks. If that sounds familiar, it should. We're living through the aftermath. And if there's anything this bill should protect against, it's the factors that led to the most recent crisis.\nBut this bill gives those failed regulators more power and autonomy, not less. It deals with the information that they didn't have and it deals with the authority they didn't have, but it doesn't deal with their failure to want to regulate. \"If you had omniscient, courageous regulators who experience no feedback, disapproval, negative press, or anger from powerful people, they could make this work,\" says Johnson. But we don't.\nThe alternative to relying on regulators would have been laying down automatic protections. Consider FDIC deposit insurance: It doesn't matter whether Ben Bernanke thinks Bank of America is doing a good job, or whether Bank of America makes a case that they can protect consumers another way. The insurance is simply there. It's one of the rules of the road. And we haven't had a serious bank run since its inception.\nConversely, this bill doesn't set, say, any specific capital requirements. Dodd isn't saying that banks with assets over $500 billion, or banks that are ruled systemically important, are limited to a 15:1 debt-to-capital ratio. That leaves the possibility that regulators will decide not to impose sufficient capital requirements when they're caught up in the next boom cycle.\nDodd's argument is that Congress should not micromanage the financial sector. But the problem isn't an abundance of micromanagement, but an absence of macromanagement. In bubble times, regulators have bubble mindsets. We who've just experienced the pain of a burst need to lay down some rules that'll hold even when irrational exuberance comes back for another visit.\nThe FDIC example brings up another point: After the Great Depression, we changed the banking market such that the problem that created the financial crisis (mistrust in banks leading to bank runs) would never happen again. We're not doing that here. \"There isn’t any real structural change to the finance sector,\" says Demos's Heather McGhee. \"It is so vastly different from what it was even 10 years ago, with most of the funding for financial firms coming from bizarre, complicated capital market products that are very attenuated from real sources of funding. But it’s all untouched.\"\nDodd, of course, is working in a 60-vote environment, not a land of his own imagination. So the bill is a compromise with political realities, and it will be compromised further still. Which is a scary prospect. Because at some point, this thing either works or it doesn't. As it stands, the bill seems like a very good thing for regulators who know they're in a financial crisis, and the new institutions meant to watch systemic risk and gather information may help regulators realize when they're headed in that direction. But if they don't -- and history suggests that they won't -- this bill does very little to protect us in their absence.\nTo put it another way, regulators would have been better off if this bill had passed before they had to respond to the financial crisis, but it's hard to say that the presence of this bill would have prevented the crisis.\n\"If it survives, the point of the CFPB, as one supporter explains it, is to \"make contracts comprehensible again.\" That's it. No one expects it to have the power to force companies to offer so-called \"plain vanilla\" products. But if it can bring contracts down to two pages from 10; if it can standardize how these products are presented so people can make informed decisions\"\nNot for nothing but if you're buying a home and can't read 10 pages or understand 10 pages maybe you shouldn't be buying a home.\nExactly how do you expect to \"enforce\" how they're presented?\nI understand you can't have unscrupulous mortgage bankers trying to make a quick buck but you also have to have new homeowners that buy within their means and stay there.\nAs you state regulation's been there (but not to this extent) but they have to WANT TO regulate.\n\"the bill creates an orderly process the FDIC can use to shut down failing institutions. In it, shareholders and unsecured creditors bear losses and management loses their jobs.\"\nThe FDIC already does this, all the time, doesn't it? What would this bill change about this function of the FDIC?\nyes, nice job of work Ezra. Macro management indeed. It was at the macro level that the system collapsed.\nI don't think we need to worry too much about people buying homes within their means, for example - it was the credit industry itself that deliberately enlarged those means. This proceeded from a systemic culture of arbitrage that could tolerate no slowdowns or limits to growth, by hook or by crook.\nThat culture is still reflected today in the $60 trillion of derivatives at large in the global economy, a sum roughly equal to the productive global economy itself.\nThe world of course can't call in this kind of gambling marker, not when the world itself is the stake. All we can do is plug the little holes that appear (using real wealth) as various players have fainting spells. Occasionally a lone player is carried to the bench.\nWhat we need - exactly as one could infer from your scepticism - is hard-coded laws that mandate the macro percentages of risk and collateral and segregate the instruments and the industries beyond discretionary choice.\nThen we could use something like the FBI to handle the regulation.\nSo the problem to be addressed lives at the macro political end of things, and this requires a large swell of public awareness coupled with some legislators who haven't been too badly bought. I have great faith in the first, but the second? There's that rub again.\nWell, it was none of their business anyway, and piling on more stupid laws still won't make it any of their business.\nAnd it's none of your business, Klein.\nGo run your own insurance co/bank or whatever if you want to, but keep your stupid nose out of everyone else's biz. You're like a reeking old washer woman, worried about everyone except your own reeking self.\n\"Who is Senator Kaufman and what power does he have in this situation? He is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee – and if you think this is a regulatory issue, that reduces the weight of his voice.\n\"But he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and we are discussing here potential crimes – or what should be crimes if the legal system still functioned. He was also a cosponsor of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) – which was right on topic – and is an experienced Capitol Hill insider who has studied these issues long and hard. He has also worked closely, over many years, with Vice President Biden.\n\"The tide is turning, but not primarily through the actions of Senator Dodd and his Banking colleagues. Rather the biggest and most unruly players in our financial system have behaved in such an egregious manner that they will be brought down by the law – either that, or they will further bring down the law.\"\nAh, now that HCR is finally about to be born, or laid to rest, glad to see you're turning to Finance Reform.\nI second rosshunter's pointer to baselinescenario.com (for anyone who's interested) and would add Rortybomb (Mike Konzcal) to that. Both sites have excellent information about the meltdown, its causes, and what needs to be done.\nBaseline guys are none to thrilled with Dodd's proposal, think it's weak and misses critical issues, and placing the CFPA at Fed is laughable, like putting one red consumer hot-line phone in the basement of the Fed building.\nRortybomb cleverly decided it would be more instructive to compare Dodd's proposal to a Fin Reform package created by Rs rather than the House version. Sure 'nough, very similar. Once again, we get watered-down legislation to appease some Rs, but no R-votes in exchange. This is really getting old.\n\"Consider FDIC deposit insurance: It doesn't matter whether Ben Bernanke thinks ...\"\n1. When did Bernanke go to work for the FDIC?\n2. Admit it -- you know next to nothing about how the FDIC operates. Before you opine at length on bank regulation, perhaps you ought to learn something about it.\nMichael Hirsch makes the following point about derivatives: \"What needs to be addressed is not so much what kind of products are out there but the way they are traded.

For years, AIG had been able to hide this exposure from regulators and the public. Had the swaps been traded on an exchange, the risk would have been transparent and AIG would have been forced to post collateral to cover its exposure. Knowing the risk, regulators could have forced AIG to raise capital or sell off its derivatives business.

The corollary is that anyone who answers an unanswerable question will be awarded a Nobel prize. One such Nobel prize winning question is “Why does matter exist?” or more precisely why wasn’t matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities at the beginning of the universe? We know this cannot be true because matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities would have annihilated to form a universe that consisted solely of radiation. The problem is that our understanding of fundamental physics predicts just that – matter and anti-matter produced in equal quantities. Theoretical physicists believe the answer lies in symmetry breaking in the early universe but experiments have yet to find results that allow physicists to distinguish between competing models of symmetry breaking.\nHowever, this may change with recent particle physics experiments performed at Fermi lab. In their experiment they measured how fast the Bs meson oscillated between matter and anti-matter. They discovered that the particle oscillates between the two states 17 to 21 times per picosecond. This is much slower than predicted by many supers",

It should be noted that the measurements, with a confidence level of 90%, are not accurate enough to be considered confirmation of the oscillation yet.\nAnother interesting aspect of this story is that the physicists involved were celebrating having analyzed “one inverse-femto-barn” of data to obtain their result. If you don’t know what a femto-barn is, you are not alone. It turns out to be a measure of a particle cross-section (10-39 m2). The smaller the particles cross-section, the more collisions you need to observe before you are sure you detect it. Hence one inverse-femto-barn of data is a huge number of collisions to be observed and analyzed.\nOn a closing note, I just wonder how a collaboration with 700 participants spread over 90 institutions located in 20 countries goes about sharing the Nobel prize.",

Of course, this does not mean that supersymmetry is wrong. Quite the contrary, it means that the MSSM is wrong. Currently, there are many competing supersymmetry models. Each of these models predicts a different rate of oscillation for the Bs meson. Quite possibly, one of these models will be consistent with the experimental results.

        "prompt": "On September 26th, more than 1,000 new and returning members from the public, private and non-profit sectors, including some of the world&apos;s largest corporations, will come together at the 11th Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York City to address some of the world&apos;s most pressing challenges. We&apos;re proud that this year&apos;s CGI Annual Meeting is being supported by 33 new and returning sponsors, including some world&apos;s largest corporations and most effective foundations -- Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Cisco, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Ford Foundation, Gap Inc., NRG Energy, Swiss Reinsurance Company, the Rockefeller Foundation and Western Union. In addition, Apple, GlaxoSmith Kline, Xerox and Cardinal Health will participate in CGI as members for the first time. In 2005, when President Clinton launched CGI, his goal was to turn ideas about how to improve the world into tangible action. He asked each GCI member to make a “Commitment to Action\" - a new and measurable plan to tackle a global issue - often collaborating with other CGI members across sectors to assist with the design and implementation. Since inception, CGI members have answered President Clinton’s call by making more than 3,200 Commitments to Action which have improved the lives of over 430 million people in more than 180 countries - many of these by our corporate members and sponsors. At CGI, corporations not only provide funding, but also apply their expertise in management, technology, manufacturing, distribution and research to help non-governmental organizations and foundations be more effective. These corporate commitments are providing better access to education and healthcare in the developing world, creating jobs and improving infrastructure in the U.S, and protecting the environment. Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, has been a key partner, making several CGI commitments to provide safe, clean drinking water to millions in the developing world. P&G has scaled up production of clean water packets and is distributing them around the world with the help of NGOs working in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Through these commitments, the company has already provided 7.5 billion liters of clean water at no cost to those who need it most in more than 70 countries worldwide. Separately, the Inter-American Development Bank is working with corporate partners, including Microsoft, Caterpillar, and Walmart, to implement an employment program across ten Latin American countries. This CGI commitment will help 500,000 disadvantaged youth enter the workforce over the next five years. CGI’s unique model of cross-sector collaboration has helped change the way many corporations approach their corporate social responsibility efforts and mirrors a shift in how foundations and NGOs are adopting best practices of management and measurement from the corporate sector, so it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise that organizations that care about being good global citizens choose to support CGI in a non-partisan way. Despite our mission, some have characterized the turnover of a handful of CGI’s sponsors as “trouble” for CGI and \"abandoning\" the Clintons, but this is just another example of critics trying to politicize philanthropy, and the facts don’t bear out the argument. Sponsorship revenue for CGI is up over last year, and more than half of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are current CGI members or sponsors. This includes companies recognized as among the most innovative and",

Similar to other thought-leader events such as the World Economic Forum, every year some sponsors leave, new sponsors sign on, and the overwhelming majority choose to continue their support. In fact, our turnover rate was lower this year than other years. And even those who aren&apos;t returning as sponsors continue to implement the commitments they launched through CGI. President Clinton often says that no one sector, organization or individual can solve the world&apos;s seemingly intractable problems alone, and that in an increasingly interconnected world, it takes collaboration to make meaningful change. CGI’s first decade has validated this approach. It wouldn’t have been possible without the corporate world embracing our model.",

Jerry Brown warned local water agency officials throughout California on Thursday that unless the delta tunnels project gets needed state and federal permits soon and continues advancing, the major infrastructure project may not happen in their lifetime.\nBrown issued the warning Thursday in a speech to more than 1,000 water experts and officials whom he urged to support the project at a conference of the Assn. of California Water Agencies.\nThe speech came a month after the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California agreed to commit nearly $11 billion to build two massive tunnels to convey water under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to the San Joaquin Valley and then on to the Southland. The project has been dubbed WaterFix by the Brown administration.\nMay. 10, 2018, 12:53 p.m.\nGov. Jerry Brown plans to add $96 million to next year’s spending plan to address threats of wildfires and climate change.\nBrown made the announcement in an executive order issued Thursday. Among other changes, the state will double the land currently managed for vegetation thinning, controlled burns and reforestation from 250,000 acres to 500,000 acres, boost education programs for landowners on forest fires and expand grants to improve watersheds.\n“I intend to mobilize the resources of the state to protect our forests and ensure they absorb carbon to the maximum degree,” Brown said in a statement.\nMay. 10, 2018, 11:36 a.m.\nThe report by Secretary of State Alex Padilla tallies an additional nearly 1.2 million voters compared with the same point before the 2014 statewide primary.

And the sixth wants an unprecedented increase in new government-subsidized homes for low- and moderate-income residents.\nMay. 10, 2018, 10:34 a.m.\nAdopting another measure to counter the Trump administration, the California Senate on Thursday sent Gov. Jerry Brown a bill that would bar the disclosure of the immigration status of alleged crime victims and witnesses in open court unless a judge rules the information is relevant to the case.\nSen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) introduced the bill after the state’s top judge expressed concerns over reports of immigration agents following immigrants in California courthouses. The efforts were seen as part of President Trump’s call for increased enforcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nMay. 10, 2018, 6:00 a.m.\nAllies of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa are targeting Republican rival John Cox with a television ad and mailers that paint him as a carpetbagger from Chicago who is not truly conservative and has a history of losing campaigns.\nOn Wednesday, a group funded by wealthy charter school backers began airing a 30-second television ad that features a man wondering who could beat Democratic front-runner Gavin Newsom in the governor’s race. The man quickly dispenses with Assemblyman Travis Allen, another Republican in the race, before turning to Cox.\nMay. 10, 2018, 12:05 a.m.\nGeorge Deukmejian was a role model for the type of officeholder we desperately need in today’s hyperventilated, polarized politics.\nMay. 9, 2018, 3:01 p.m.\nCalifornia’s teachers’ retirement system will pressure retail companies it invests in to stop selling firearms and parts that are outlawed by the state, and would consider divestment from firms that refuse to make changes, a key panel decided Wednesday.\nThe vote by the Investment Committee for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System was supported by state Treasurer John Chiang, an ex officio member of the panel.

        "prompt": "Tax experts think some of the ideas in a report by the Tax Working Group tomorrow may be taken up by the Government because of the impact of the global financial crisis and because of concerns about the Government's revenue base.\nThe report of the Tax Working Group has been touted as a potential catalyst for an overhaul of the tax system, though Finance Minister Bill English has called for practical suggestions because any changes would need public support.\nHe has ruled out recommendations last year from the separate 2025 Productivity Taskforce to cut income tax to 20 percent and slash government spending by $9 billion as too radical.\nPrime Minister John Key has talked about shoring up the tax base and ultimately lowering personal tax rates, while ruling out a capital gains tax on sales of family homes.\nThe issues canvassed by the working group since it was set up in May last year include broadening the tax base, aligning personal and corporate tax rates, the balance between income and consumption taxes like GST, the taxation of property compared to other investments, alignment with Australian tax policy and tackling foreign companies that load subsidiaries with debt to avoid tax.\nThe working group does not make government policy but government officials have had an input into the group.\n``It is quite an interesting beast. It is a great kite flying mechanism and there are some good people on it,'' said Neil Russ, leader of Buddle Finlay's tax practice.\nThere have been many tax reviews before, including the McLeod report.\n``The difference this time is that there really is a need,'' said Mr Russ.\n``I believe the revenue officials are very concerned about rental property investors taking tax deductions,'' Mr Russ said.\nOften tax was a significant factor in decisions people made about investing in rental property.\nRents often did not cover the cost of mortgages in rental properties and the difference was being bridged by the public in the form of tax break to owners.\nThis was the sort of issue the group was likely to address, he said. Another possibility was some sort of wealth tax at a low level.\nMr English has said any changes to the taxation system would have to be cost neutral, meaning revenue gained in any one area would be offset by reductions elsewhere.\nIn working papers the group advocated a land tax over a capital gains tax, on the basis of simplicity.\nIt noted New Zealand's 30 percent corporate tax compared to an average rate of 26 percent for small OECD countries.\nProfessor Bob Buckle, the group's chairman, has said that about $500 million in net losses was",

These are used for property investments.\nGroup members include Rob Cameron, Paul Dunne, Arthur Grimes, Rob McLeod, Gareth Morgan, Geof Nightingale, Casey Plunket, John Prebble, Mike Shaw, John Shewan, Mark Weldon and David White.\nMr English has said a strategic review of the tax system was necessary in light of the challenges posed by the current economic and fiscal environment and the Government's medium-term goal of a 30 percent top personal tax rate.\nThe tax working group has been criticised as being stacked with corporates.",

According to new research, the peatlands are much larger than originally estimated.\nThe record peatlands comprise 56,000 square miles, larger than the state of New York.\n\"Our research shows that the peat in the central Congo Basin covers a colossal amount of land,\" Simon Lewis, a professor at the University of Leeds, said in a news release. \"It is 16 times larger than the previous estimate and is the single largest peatland complex found anywhere in the tropics.\"\nBeneath the surface, the peatlands are hiding 30 billion tons of carbon.\n\"These peatlands hold nearly 30 percent of the world's tropical peatland carbon, that's about 20 years of the fossil fuel emissions of the United States of America,\" Lewis added.\nPeat is the type of soil commonly found in wetlands. It's typically found in cool environs and among dense forest, where decaying plant matter is plentiful. Because peat remains waterlogged, carbon released from decomposing organic matter remains trapped and stored beneath the surface.\nCarbon reserves within the Congo Basin have been accumulating for at least 11,000 years.\n\"Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against",

Core samples helped researchers plot peatland depths.\nResearchers hope their work -- detailed in the journal Nature -- will encourage the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and international conservation groups to better protect the peatlands.\n\"Our new peatland map is the first step in understanding this vast ecosystem,\" Lewis said. \"These swamp forests have been wrongly classified in all previous maps. I hope our work encourages much more investment in this neglected region to better understand the role of peatlands within the global carbon cycle and the climate system.\"",

        "prompt": "It's a bit late to wish attorney and activist Raphael Lemkin happy birthday. Born on June 24, 1900, he died at age 59.\nBut during this too-short life, turbulent with activism on behalf of a cause he worked toward all of his adult life, Rafael Lemkin changed the world.\nAs part of this project, he worked hard to convince the United Nations to pay more attention to the issue of crimes against humanity as a violation of international law. The result was the United Nations Convention against Genocide, written by Lemkin and approved by the General Assembly on December 1948, a day before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN.\nWhen Professor Richard Brietman of American University, speaking at a July 5 Conversation on Human Rights sponsored by the Washington Friends Meeting (FMW--its committee on religious education) and the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL), said that Lemkin deserved more credit in his efforts toward human rights than did Eleanor Roosevelt, so key to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I sat up with a jolt.\nI knew his name but not his fame. This early student of linguistics, studying the history of recent mass oppression--in Armenia, Syria, and the Ukraine, respectively, in the early twentieth century--coined a term in 1943 to describe not only whole-scale slaughter of a race, genos in Greek, but the accompanying decimation of the relevant cultures and mores, genocide. He needed--we all needed--a term to describe not only such hideous events of the past but the holocaust in progress in Germany and Eastern Europe against Jews and other minorities. The second root in the term, -cide, has the meaning \"killing, cutting down.\"\nIn 1933, presenting his case to a League of Nations conference in Madrid, Lemkin had used the term barbarity.\nPower of the word. It grows slowly. In 1944, said Brietman, a Gallup poll conducted in the United States revealed that the public thought that about 100,000 Jews had been murdered by the Germans. The press hadn't written much. The reality of the six million came later, as the Allies discovered the numerous concentration camps writhing with corpses living and dead.\nPhotographs of the atrocity, taken by both Germans and their enemies, were a compelling part of the evidence presented at the Nuremberg Trial in 1945, where crimes against humanity was one of four charges filed against twenty-two of the most powerful German agents of the slaughter. Another of them, Adolf Eichmann, discovered in Argentina in 1960 and tried and condemned soon after in Israel, revealed how many had been murdered, that figure of six million that haunts the world deeply to this day.\nThe charge considered most significant of the four, said Brietman, was crimes against peace.\nA crime against peace as well as a another genocide of six million, in the years 1932--1933 and surrounding, of Ukrainians by the Soviet Union via starvation of these inhabitants of the \"world's granary,\" was publicized and analyzed by Lemkin in the early 1950s. The Ukrainians, a sovereign culture unrelated to the Russians, had risen up in an effort toward full independence from the Communist tyranny.\nAlthough protests against this atrocity had been held in New York City by surviving Ukrainians in 1933 and 1953--Lemkin having delivered a moving address at the latter--it was not until 2008 that his analysis of the events was publicized, including his perspective on genocide as encompassing more than people, but everything else that their existence signified, everything that distinguished them from other cultures, peoples, mores, and gifts",

Despite the publicity such horrors generate sooner or later, after their occurrence genocide continues to occur: most recently in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Somalia, Darfur . . .\nWhen will the list end? How do we combat this hideous disease named by Lemkin?\nNo law can prevent its own violation, the audience of the FCNL/FMW Conversation was informed, though disciplinary institutions sprang up in the wake of World War II and human rights had been a concern of the League of Nations.

He worked for the U.S. State Department, where he was instrumental in getting the United Nations to adopt the Convention against Genocide. He was also instrumental in getting the United States to sign the Convention, a signature that was not withdrawn until 1986.\nLemkin worked for the United Nations as a consultant on genocide until 1951, when he was fired for what was considered a lack of political acumen and the inability to play the game of diplomacy.

        "prompt": "Editor's note: This article is a part of a series reviewing Utah history for KSL.com's Historic section.\nCOALVILLE — NaVee Vernon seemed unconcerned about the snowflakes swirling around her as she eagerly led a group of about a dozen state, county and local officials up a hill toward Coalville Ledge.\nVernon didn’t have time to complain about the poor weather. This was her opportunity to share with others her hometown gem and a forgotten piece of Utah history.\n“I’ve always loved where I’ve lived — but look out there from this ledge … What do you see? It’s beautiful,” Vernon said, sitting on a pile of sandstone near the top of the ledge, which separates the small city of about 1,300 from Echo Reservoir.\nFrom this spot, there’s a serene view of the surrounding mountains and the sprawling farm plots within the valley. One of the officials points out an osprey that rests on a tree near Chalk Creek, which flows adjacent to the ledge.\nOf course, the scenic view is not what brought these officials to the area Tuesday afternoon.\nVernon, with the Summit County Historical Society, co-led a tour with the Utah Division of State History to show members of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, Utah Division of Indian Affairs, the North Summit School District (who owns the land where the ledge is) and other agencies the petroglyphs painted and scratched on the ledge surface. They’re concerned because this spot, enjoyed by many for thousands of years, is jeopardized by a growing amount of graffiti and extreme weather patterns.\nWith the reservoir opening as Utah’s newest state park likely bringing more people to Coalville this summer, Utah State History officials are hoping to educate others about this ignored piece of history before it’s completely destroyed.\n“This has been a really well-kept secret and we’re really excited to roll it out in a more public way with the proper attention, care and reverence,” said Elizabeth Hora, an archaeologist with Utah Division of State History.\nThe group pauses about 100 feet from the trailhead, where Hora and Shawn Lambert, another archaeologist with Utah Division of State History, point out tiny scratches on the ledge not far from an opening where an aqueduct once ran through the ledge.\nSome of these images are believed to date back thousands of years, where others from Ute and Shoshoni tribes date back to 800 years ago. There’s also etches from Utah’s early pioneers and townspeople in the 19th and 20th centuries. Vernon laughs, saying that she found her uncle’s name on the walls.\nThe group moves up the path to where there are a few faded human and animal-shaped pictographs — painted rock art — on the wall. They have red ochre and orange-yellow paint, and officials date them to 200 to 1300 A.D. because of the headdresses depicted in the art.\n“We think they may have been mixing it on the spot and applying it to the rock as paint,” she said, grabbing dirt from the ledge and mashing the powder in her palm.\nSome of the art compares with petroglyphs in Vernal and more in Colorado.\nFinding this art can be a difficult task. In fact, some of it isn’t even noticed until the group is headed back down the trail and new art is found each trip out, changing the timeframe of the art.\n“With rock art, light is so important because you can come here three times and never see it. When the light is perfect, boom! It pops,” Christopher Merritt, deputy state historic preservation officer with Utah Division of State History, said.\nThen there’s spray-paint graffiti, which began appearing at the ledge in the 1970s. Since then, people have left everything from love messages to profanity.\nMerritt convened the group on Tuesday to help teach them about the ledge’s history. Many who knew about the ledge hadn’t heard that it had petroglyphs dating as far back as 200 A.D.\nHe stressed the site differs from the hundreds of the state’s other petroglyph sites because of its location in Summit County instead of central or southern Utah. There is currently no state plan on the docket to protect the ledge.\nHowever, with some eyes on protecting similar rock art in Utah County that has been inadvertently damaged from gunfire, state historians wanted to show that there’s more threatened rock art in Utah.\n“There are no set plans (right now). That’s why we wanted",
        "outputs": {

        "prompt": "The recent delivery of a new advanced air defense system on Thursday shows the Corps is getting serious about a looming air defense threat.\nAir defense is something the Corps hasn’t had to think much about over the past 17 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. aircraft have dominated the airspace. An advanced radar system will be pivotal to the Corps as it prepares for a potential fight with near-peer adversaries where air and ballistic missile threats are rising.\nOn Thursday Northrop Grumman delivered the first Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar, or G/ATOR, which incorporates a new advanced high-powered antenna technology known as GaN.\n“The incorporation of this advanced technology in production radars is unique to the Marine Corps and enables G/ATOR to provide additional mission capability to the warfighter at an affordable cost,” Roshan Roeder, vice president, land and avionics C4ISR division at Northrop Grumman, said in a press release.\nThe short and medium range radar system is capable of detecting cruise missiles, air breathing targets, rockets, mortars and artillery. An air breathing target could be any missile that requires the intake of air for combustion.\nThe radar can also double as an air traffic control system.\nThe highly mobile G/ATOR system will aid the Corps’ mission in the Pacific where its forces will be decentralized, operating on remote islands and floating bases.\nThe air and missile threat to the Corps is very real, especially in the Pacific where China has been busy advancing its ballistic missile capability.\nThe threat prompted a high-",

The latest draft of the annual defense legislation includes nearly $225 million for procurement of six new G/ATOR systems, about $86 million more than in 2017.\nThe delivery is the seventh overall low rate initial production G/ATOR system the Corps has received, and Northrop Grumman says the new technology will enhance radar sensitivity and improve overall reliability, according to a press release.\nNorthrop Grumman says that all future deliveries of the G/ATOR will incorporate the GaN advanced technology.\nThe Corps began receiving its G/ATOR radar system in 2017 and achieved initial operational capability in February.\nNorthrop Grumman and the Corps expect full rate production of the G/ATOR system in early 2019.",

        "prompt": "Memo to Conservatives, New Democrats and others who are crowing about how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears to have been revealed as a harsher and less cuddly politician than he has been thought to be till now: Be careful what you wish for.\nIf Trudeau is revealed as a tough guy who is not particularly nice to his MPs, under a mere veneer of sensitivity, Canadians, who have a history of liking tough leaders like the current PM's Dear Ole Dad, may like him better.\nIt's certainly true that the version of Trudeau now emerging from the wreckage of the SNC-Lavalin affair shows him as not quite the warm and fuzzy high school drama teacher we were all so keen on when we were justifiably hell bent on getting rid of Stephen Harper. This is true even if Trudeau can still summon up a tear when circumstances warrant.\nBut the fact is, the recent record suggests Canadians don't mind tough leaders. In fact, they may prefer them. Consider Harper himself, and Jean Chrétien, two of the more obvious electoral successes in recent Canadian political history.\nNor do Canadians seem to mind politicians switching their narrative from idealistic to tough -- consider the old block himself, whence Justin Trudeau was chipped.\nAs a youth, I heard Pierre Trudeau speak before he had yet won the Liberal leadership. He sounded coolly intellectual and warmly idealistic, but he had not yet revealed the steel at his core. However, if any of us had really been paying attention we might have sensed it there.\nWhat's more, despite claims to the contrary, Canadian voters apparently don't mind serial liars, an extreme lack of diplomacy or even an apparent degree of corruption in their politicians, as long as they give the impression of being tough enough. Consider the recent success of Doug Ford in Ontario and the apparent popularity of Jason Kenney here in Alberta, if the latest poll touted by the Calgary Herald, which acts as Kenney's personal publicity department, is anything to go by.\nConsider the late Jim Prentice, premier of Alberta, who, among other things, didn't appear to be as tough as the NDP's Rachel Notley as election day neared in May 2015. Andrew Scheer, do you hear the wind whispering your name?\nSo don't be too surprised if Canadians don't mind all that much if Trudeau lets a new, steelier persona more like his late father's emerge.\nRight now, we are told, Trudeau's personal popularity has taken a hit. But if I were a Liberal strategist, I would not panic about that, driven as it is by nearly hysterical tweeting by Conservative operatives -- the inspiration for which Scheer's Conservative Party strategic advisers take from their Trumpian Republican mentors south of the imaginary line, and perhaps others.\nMore than one side can tweet,",

If necessary they can remind them what Senator Patrick Brazeau discovered about Trudeau's right hook.\nSo don't be surprised if we soon hear Trudeau uttering, as another tough old pol once did: \"Just watch me!\"\nDavid Climenhaga, author of the Alberta Diary blog, is a journalist, author, journalism teacher, poet and trade union communicator who has worked in senior writing and editing positions with the Toronto Globe and Mail and the Calgary Herald.

        "prompt": "Funding of technical training for jobs that don't require college degrees has plummeted since the 1980s, but a new crop of programs show promise by being more responsive to local businesses.\nAn A+ course in Cincinnati in July 2015. Here, students are working on hardware configuration and repair.\nJoe Easley has cycled through so many jobs since graduating high school nine years ago that it’s hard to imagine his career is just beginning.\nThere was a brief stint as operations supervisor for a Steak 'n Shake restaurant in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. There were jobs at several call centers, selling phones at AT&T and Verizon stores, and as a customer service rep at JPMorgan Chase.\nIn between, he started (and didn’t finish) a handful of college degree programs, completed a certificate in broadcasting, and even joined the Air Force.\n“I was desperately trying to find the right path for me,” Mr. Easley tells The Christian Science Monitor.\nHe finally hit his stride last year after completing a free training program in information technology (IT) skills. There was a high demand for such skills from local businesses; before even receiving his certification, Easley was entertaining possible jobs at Time Warner Cable and with a defense contractor. Salary offers were coming in at $43,000 per year – twice as much as he had ever earned.\nEasley’s story is far from unique. A growing body of evidence is showing promising career results for people who train in moderately technical skills that employers in manufacturing, IT, and healthcare say they desperately need.\nCalled “sector-based” or \"skills-based\" training, this model – of finding out what jobs community businesses need to fill and training people for them – has the potential to re-invigorate workforce development at a precarious time in the country’s economy, supporters say. According to employers and economists, there aren’t enough workers with the right skills to fill the plethora of jobs, from machinists to health technicians, that don’t require a college degree. That's why twenty-one states now use sector-based training to plug those skills gaps in their local labor markets.\nThe model also has gained national political traction in recent years. President Obama, once a staunch proponent of college-for-all, has devoted more attention to training workers for existing, unfilled jobs in his second term.\nAs a Virginia senator, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine introduced legislation last year to make more Pell Grant dollars, which help fund education for low-income students, available for short-term skills training. Hillary Clinton has a set of proposals for skills training, and said in her DNC speech in July that training for existing jobs would be a priority.\nThe model is by no means perfect. It can serve only a limited number of workers who have certain qualities, such as an aptitude for math, or the constitution to work in certain medical jobs. There’s also the threat of training people for specific skills that may not easily transfer to other industries if the labor market changes.\n“There are some major challenges involved in bringing these programs to a scale sufficient to really improve outcomes for less-educated workers, while maintaining program quality,” Georgetown University economist Harry J. Holzer wrote in a 2015 analysis for the US Department of Labor. Still, he concluded, those challenges can be overcome.\nAccording to the National Skills Coalition, a Washington-based career-training advocacy group, the need for workers in middle-skilled jobs in the US will remain one of the economy’s most pronounced in the near term.\nIndeed, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a surplus of bachelor’s degrees in the workforce, while moderately skilled positions languish.\nMiddle-skill jobs — jobs that require more than a high school diploma but not a four-year degree — make up 54 percent of jobs in the US economy. But only 44 percent of US workers are trained at the middle-skill level.\nThrough 2022, the share of high-skill jobs, including lawyers and doctors, is expected to stay stagnant at 31 percent, the skills coalition estimates. The number of middle-skilled jobs, which call for training but no college degree, will continue to make up the bulk of work, though dropping slightly from 54 to 49 percent in the next six years.\nBesides helping employers, studies show that skills-based training gives an earnings boost to workers in the middle of the economy, which has been hardest-hit by a shift in the labor market that makes it much harder to earn a living wage without post-secondary education.\nFor instance, a June brief describing a controlled study of 2,600 low-wage workers reported a 14-percent rise, on average, in annual earnings – or $1,945 – for those who completed a skills-based training program. Researchers from MDRC, the public-policy organization that conducted the survey, characterized the findings as an “encouraging” indicator of their effectiveness.\nEasley had the kind of success the model was built for. His free, eight-week training in A+, a certification for computer technicians, was organized by the Ohio branch of New York City-based nonprofit Per Scholas, a pioneer in the field of IT career training for low-income workers. Besides computer skills, Per Scholas teaches how to evaluate benefits packages, ask for raises, and navigate the uncertain path of career advancement.\nPer Scholas was one of four nonprofits in New York City, Cleveland, and Tulsa, Okla. to participate in MDRC’s research. The nonprofit raised annual earnings for its workers by 26 percent, or about $3,700.\nOther nonprofits showed weaker results, partly because it took them time to build relationships with local businesses, says MDRC. In some cases, it was because they trained people for jobs that were plentiful when the study began, but disappeared by the time it was over.\nThat’s what happened to Austin Rhine, a participant in the MDRC study based in Tulsa. Less than a year after training and getting placed in a job as a CNC (computer numeric controlled) machinist at McKissick, a manufacturer of equipment for the oil and gas industry, he was laid off with a wave of cutbacks.\n“I was just kind of bummed,” says Mr. Rhine.\nThe oil glut that has sent oil prices plummeting in recent years has devastated the oil and gas industry in Oklahoma, which drives the local economy. Thousands of people have lost jobs in the Tulsa region as energy companies have downsized or gone bust.\nRhine is emblematic of one of the biggest drawbacks to sector-based training: the threat of training people for very specific jobs skills that may not be transferable to other industries.\nHappily, Rhine’s skills proved useful beyond oil and gas. He was a good at math and a hard worker, impressing his instructors so much that he snagged the McKissick position just a couple of months into his four-month training program. Madison was able to find him a job as a machinist for an aerospace manufacturer within a couple of weeks of his being laid off.\nThe nonprofit now is steering its CNC machinist training program towards aerospace manufacturing, an industry expected to grow for years in the region.\n“I think there’s no greater sin than training people that desperately need a higher income and better career opportunities in an industry where they can’t work,” says Ms. Pennington.\nResponding to the changing needs of local businesses is key to the success of demand-based training programs, say advocates of the model. But until recently, it wasn’t standard practice in the workforce development field.\nMeanwhile, although the number of college graduates has grown, businesses have complained they can’t find workers for moderately technical jobs.\n“I spent an entire year going to high schools and junior high schools talking to classes and explaining that you don’t have to go to college if you’re not on the college path,” says Kenneth Statton, who hired Madison’s trainees at M&M Manufacturing, an aerospace manufacturer in Tulsa, which he sold last year.\nMr. Statton was part of a coalition of local business leaders working with high schools, nonprofits like Madison, and community colleges to build a pipeline of workers for the manufacturing industry. They targeted kids who weren’t likely to go to college.\n“The realization came in 2008 to 2009 that if we were going to, as a group of manufacturers in this region, get the qualified help we needed, we were going to have to train it ourselves,” says Statton.\nIn addition to keeping up with the twists and turns of the labor market, modern skills training programs face another major challenge: funding. Federal investment in skills training has declined by an estimated 83 percent between 1980 and 2008, largely because federal programs from past decades, which taught general skills and polished resumes, were found to be ineffective.\nIn 2014, President Obama signed a renewal of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which made sector training a requirement for states. But the law allocated 43 percent less funding than the previous renewal, 16 years earlier. Today, the government doles out $2.7 billion for workforce development annually, compared with $4.74 billion in 2000, adjusted for inflation.\nAt the same time, increasing access to college has become more of a priority. In today's dollars, subsidies in the form of federal Pell Grants have ballooned from about $10 billion distributed every year to students in 2000 to about $30 billion in 2016. Only 4 percent of this money goes to middle-skill career training, estimates the National Skills Coalition.\nSkills-training advocates say",

Heller, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, worry that diverting more Pell funds to technical training programs could mean less money going to help low-income students fund college.\nOn an individual level, at least, skills training has been a vital source of encouragement for the workers they have reached. Though Easley still hopes to finish college some day, he says the support he got from Per Scholas was life-changing.\n“One thing that a lot of people don’t understand is that if you grow up in a low-income situation you may not have that home support, that mom or dad that says, ‘You can do it, Johnny, you can do whatever you put your mind to, I believe in you,'” he says.",
