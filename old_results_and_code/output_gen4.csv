Explain the process of photosynthesis.,"Photosynthesis is a process that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugar (glucose) using sunlight as energy.The equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2Photosynthesis occurs in plants and some bacteria and algae. It is the primary source of oxygen on Earth, making it essential for most life forms to survive.","Photosynthesis is a reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugar with the help of light. A water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxyl radical. An electron is released from one water molecule, which gets oxidized to a hydrogen atom with one proton. At the same time, a hydroxyl radical will be reduced with a hydrogen atom from a different water molecule. Carbon dioxide will react with a hydrogen ion to form a carboxyl group (a carboxylic acid). Three water molecules will react with a carboxyl group to make one glucose molecule with three water molecules going to waste. Electrons will go back to where they started, making water again. All water will go back to where it started, making one water molecule. Ribulose bisphosphate will be broken down to make 3-PGA (three phosphoglycerate) with one water going to waste. Energy is needed in this step. Ribulose bisphosphate is made up of 2 ribuloses together. Both water molecules bind to separate ribuloses making one 2 water molecules together. Ribulose is a hexose sugar, meaning it has six carbons. Bisphosphate is added on to make ribulose bisphosphate. Bisphosphate is added on both ends, making one 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added on both ends, making one 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added on both ends, making one 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added on both ends, making one 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added on both ends, making one 2 water molecules together.

Describe the water cycle.,"The water cycle is also called hydrologic cycle. It is the continuous movement of water between land, atmosphere, and ocean, driven by the sun's energy.","Water is a basic element on our planet earth, it surrounds all living organisms and it participate on many life processes. The water cycle is also called hydrologic cycle. Basically you can divide this cycle in three different parts: evaporation, precipitation and runoff. Evaporation is the process that water molecules go from liquid state to gas state.

What is Newton's first law of motion?,Newton's First Law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.,"Newton's Laws describe three basic concepts concerning force and motion, they were all stated by Sir Isaac Newton in his work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica published on 5 July 1687. Classically speaking, there are three laws governing mechanics: one concerned with static equilibrium, one with uniform linear motion and one with accelerated motion. Classical mechanics can be extended to cover motion close to the speed of light. Relativistic mechanics is still built on these three laws, but they take on a different form. Because of the nature of space-time close to the speed of light, energy and momentum play key roles. As long as you do not approach light speed, classical mechanics works just fine. But when you get closer to that velocity, you have to take relativity into account."

What is the function of the heart in the human body?,"The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system to all parts of the body.The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). Blood enters the right atrium from veins and leaves the heart through the left atrium after it is pumped by the ventricles.The heart is located behind the sternum, between the lungs. It beats about 70 times per minute in adults at rest, and pumps about 5 litres of blood per minute.The heart is divided into four chambers, with one atrium and one ventricle on each side. The atria receive blood returning from the body, while the ventricles pump blood to the lungs and body tissues.The heart is divided into four chambers, with one atrium and one ventricle on each side.

How does a compass work?,A compass uses Earth's magnetic field to point north.The needle in a compass is made of iron. The magnet inside Earth is like a giant bar magnet. It makes the Earth's magnetic field.The needle in a compass points towards the North Pole.The North Pole is where the lines of the Earth's magnetic field come together.,"A compass uses a magnetic field that it detects with one or more magnets on the dial of the instrument. Because all magnets respond to this same invisible force, they all point in a similar way. Researchers discovered many years ago that a simple magnet will behave similarly when you put a needle on it and allow it to turn freely on a flat surface. As long as you do not disturb it, it will maintain its current position. When you move it around, it will adjust itself back into alignment with Earth's natural field orientation. This is how you can determine direction with just a compass. The device you typically carry with you will have a dial on it with a variety of different orientations marked on it. Generally you will notice a group of arrows with one pointing north, another west, one south and one east. They may also be labeled like this. You can simply rotate it until it is in alignment with Earth's magnetic field and you know which direction you are facing in relation to these markings. To make it easy you will notice a simple arrow on one side of it. By holding it in front of you it will point directly north at all times. This makes traveling easy because you only have to walk toward the arrow. To go to any other destination you use landmarks to help you arrive at your destination."

RAM (random access memory) is temporary memory, which means that it holds information only while the power remains on.","A computer is a machine that can accept input, perform some operation on it and give the result in a meaningful manner. Generally input and output are done with human help. For example you type something on keyboard and press enter button. But what you see is not just what you typed but what you want to be displayed on screen in nice format."

What is the Declaration of Independence?,The Declaration of Independence is a document that was signed by American colonists in 1776.,"It is a statement adopted by Congress on July 4, 1776, explaining why the colonies were separating from Great Britain and becoming a new nation called the United States of America. Congress approved the text, written by Thomas Jefferson, on July 2, but it was not signed until August 2. Congress had already voted in favor of independence on July 2, 1776, but the colonies still needed to explain their position to the rest of the world. Congress appointed a committee of five men to write a formal declaration explaining this action. Committee members were Thomas Jefferson (chairman), John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. Congress used the draft prepared by Jefferson as the basis for its final version, making only minor changes in wording."

How do solar panels generate electricity?,"Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells, which are made from silicon and other materials. When sunlight hits the photovoltaic cells, electrons are excited and move around, creating an electric current. This electric current is then converted into usable electricity by inverters, which can be used to power homes and businesses.","A solar panel is a device that captures energy from sunlight and converts it into electrical energy. Generally speaking, there are three basic steps involved in generating power with a solar panel:<br /><br />1. The sun shines on the panel and creates heat. Radiant heat causes electrons to move inside the semiconductor material. Because of this movement, a direct current (DC) flow is created, which can be used to power electronic devices. Generally speaking, many different types of cells will make up one solar panel. Groups of many different solar cells will make up a photovoltaic array.<br /><br />2. The direct current flow is converted into alternating current flow. Because most appliances run on AC power, a conversion needs to take place. Because of the type of electricity produced by solar panels, they can only work on DC flow. Because of this problem, a device called an inverter needs to change the current flow from direct current to alternating current flow.<br /><br />3. Many people use batteries connected to their home's wiring system. Because of this connection, electricity can move throughout the house. Because people use so much electricity, they may use more energy than they can produce on the sunniest day.<br /><br />Home energy storage systems can help people save money on electricity bills. Generally speaking, home energy storage systems use battery pack technology to store energy. Generally speaking, people will use a generator, wind turbine or a solar panel to charge a group of batteries.

Explain the concept of gravity.,"Gravity is a force that causes objects to be attracted towards each other, and also the force that keeps your feet on the ground.The earth has gravity because it has mass, which means that it takes up space and has energy.The earth attracts everything that it comes in contact with, including you.The earth is constantly moving, and so is everything else. The earth is rotating (spinning) on its axis at 1000 miles per hour. It is also traveling around the sun at about 67,000 miles per hour. So what you think is standing still isn't. You are actually falling toward the center of the earth as fast as 9.8 meters per second per second, and that's why you are not falling off the surface of the earth.","Gravity is a force that causes all objects with mass to fall towards one another. Researchers have found many different forces that help gravity do its job. Atoms make up everything we see and interact with. Atoms are made of three basic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Researchers discovered a new kind of atom called a ""neutrino"" which they say will change everything we know about gravity."
What is global warming?,"Global warming is the rise in temperature of the Earth’s surface, caused by the greenhouse effect.The earth’s atmosphere is naturally composed of gases that trap heat.The increase in these “greenhouse” gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have raised the average global temperatures by about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1900.","It is a phenomenon in which global surface temperatures increase as a result of human activity and the emission of greenhouse gases. Over time, it causes ice caps to melt, sea levels to rise, weather patterns to change, and ecosystems to be destroyed. Even though climate change is happening now, we can still prevent its worst effects. Everyone needs to take action to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases.

What are renewable energy sources?,"Renewable Energy Sources: Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition are mechanisms that capture the wind’s energy and hydroelectricity (the energy of moving water). Sunlight, wind, waves, tides, biomass, geothermal heat, and hydropower can be used to generate electricity. Nuclear energy is derived from uranium, a radioactive element found in rock, that decays to become helium gas. Although this is a constant process, it is classified as nonrenewable because the amount of uranium on Earth is limited and will not be replenished.The sun is Earth’s main source of energy. Solar energy is captured and converted into thermal (heat) or electrical energy in a variety of ways, such as using photovoltaic panels, which convert light into electricity, or solar heating collectors, which concentrate sunlight to heat water or air. Wind power is produced by wind turbines, which convert the kinetic energy in the wind into electricity. Ocean energy can come from tides, waves, and temperature differences in seawater. Biomass includes wood, waste, and alcohol fuels made from plant materials.","Renewable Energy Source is a source of energy that cannot be exhausted. Because they will never run out, it is said to be a sustainable source. Because they produce less pollution than other energy sources, they are said to be cleaner energy sources. Examples of renewable energy sources are wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass and tidal."

What is the internet?,"The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standardized Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries various information and services, such as: electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web......The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via packet switching, which was needed for time-sharing. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s.The term Internet is a shortened form of internetwork, or interconnected network, and is also sometimes used as a metonym for the World Wide Web.[6] Starting from a small number of host computers in the early 1970s, the ARPANET evolved into today's global Internet, with millions of computers connected through vastly improved technology.The Internet has no central governing body, but is overseen and managed by a loosely knit confederation of national, regional and international private and public organizations and corporations.The Internet is governed by a set of principles called Internet governance, which includes the high level goals and basic policies to be applied to the management of the Internet.[7] However, the day-to-day operation is left to private companies and civil society groups, including ISPs, registries, standard development organizations, root server operators, and domain name registrars.The Internet is also referred to as the Net,[8][9] and the WWW, often abbreviated as the Web.[10][11] However, ""the Internet"" is not synonymous with the World Wide Web; it also includes email, telephony, and the various streams of the Internet protocol suite that do not carry web content.","It's a computer network that connect people all over the world.

What is the theory of relativity?,"The theory of relativity (also known as special theory of relativity, general theory of relativity) is one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). It is the physical theory of spacetime that replaces the classical concepts of absolute, frame-independent time and space with concepts of spacetime events and relativistic simultaneity.The theory was presented by Albert Einstein in 1905, while he was working on his thesis. In 1916 he published his theory of general relativity, which also describes gravity.The theory of relativity is based on two postulates: (1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial systems (i.e., no preferred reference frames). (2) The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their velocity relative to each other.","It's a scientific theory that describe how different objects behave when they are moving close to speed of light. Albert Einstein discovered it in 1905. Currently we know three different kind of it: special theory of relativity, general theory of relativity and theory of everything.

How does a refrigerator work?,"A refrigerator is a device that uses electricity to produce cold air. It works by circulating a fluid called refrigerant through a system of coils and pipes. The refrigerant absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator, which cools the food and other items stored within.The heat absorbed by the refrigerant is then released outside the refrigerator, where it can dissipate into the atmosphere.The main components of a refrigerator include a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, evaporator, and fan.The compressor is responsible for pumping the refrigerant through the system. It compresses the refrigerant, increasing its pressure and temperature. As the refrigerant passes through the condenser, it releases heat to the surrounding air, which lowers its temperature.The expansion valve regulates the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator. As the refrigerant expands in the evaporator, it absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator, causing it to become colder.","A refrigerator is a device that uses a refrigerant liquid to lower the temperature of the surrounding environment. Even though you might think it is magic, refrigerators are really just a machine that transfers heat from one substance to another substance. A real world example is a car engine. Refrigerant is like water in this example. Both water and refrigerant can take heat energy from something hot, turn it into mechanical energy, use the mechanical energy to turn something cold, then take heat energy from something cold and turn it into mechanical energy again. But water cannot go back and forth between liquid and gas many times. Refrigerant is different because it is a liquid at normal temperatures, but a gas when you compress it with a motor and a fan. Because water cannot change states like this it needs a lot more power than a refrigerant to make it work. But water is easy to get so it is used for big jobs. Refrigerants do not have to be made they are found all over nature. Even something as simple as drinking water has refrigerant in it. But water doesn't work for everything so refrigerant gets used.

How is glass made?,"Glass is usually made by melting sand, soda ash and limestone in a furnace at 1500 degrees celsius or higher.The molten glass is then transferred into moulds to cool, which forms the shape of the final product.","Glass is typically manfactured with three different steps: 1) melting the sand (silica oxide), and additives such as a basic oxide and a coloring agent. By stirring you can prevent that it burns on the sides. Part of the water is already added during this step. But water is also added in step 2, to prevent the liquid from sticking to the walls. Because water dissolves many oxides it is important to choose the right water quality otherwise the composition will change. Even water containing salt is not suitable.

What is the structure of an atom?,"Atoms are made up of three main parts, a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive charge while neutrons carry no charge at all. Electrons carry a negative charge that balances out the positively charged protons in the nucleus. Atoms can also be thought of as consisting of a central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.The electrons are arranged into shells, like layers of an onion. Each shell has a different energy level and is associated with one or more subshells.The electrons within each shell move about randomly, but they are not free to leave the atom because of their attraction to the positively charged nucleus.The electrons within each shell move about randomly, but they are not free to leave the atom because of their attraction to the positively charged nucleus.The electrons within each shell move about randomly, but they are not free to leave the atom because of their attraction to the positively charged nucleus.","Atoms consist of a nucleus and one or more electrons. Atoms with one electron are hydrogen atoms, helium has 2 electrons, etc. Atoms with no electrons are protons, helium has 2 protons, etc. Atoms with one neutron are neutrons, helium has 1 neutron, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc. Atoms with one neutron are proton, helium has 1 proton, etc."
How does a camera work?,"A camera is a device that captures images, typically in digital form, and stores them on a memory card or hard drive. Cameras can be used to take pictures of scenery, people, objects, and other things. They can also be used to record videos.The main parts of a camera include the lens, sensor, shutter, aperture, and focus mechanism. The lens focuses light onto the sensor, which converts the light into digital signals. The shutter controls how long the light is exposed to the sensor. The aperture controls how much light enters the lens. The focus mechanism adjusts the distance between the lens and the sensor to make sure everything is in focus.",A camera uses a mechanical shutter to allow light to fall on a film. By blocking the passage of light with a shutter for a specific interval you control how much light you allow on your film. By using different shutter speeds you change the amount of light that falls on a piece of film you control the exposure of a scene on film. By using different apertures you change the size of the opening on a lens you change the speed with which you allow light on film you control depth of field. Giving you control over both shutter speed and aperture you can choose a proper combination you control your exposure of a scene on film you control both a scene brightness and a scene sharpness. By using different film you change film sensitivity you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film speed you control film You control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter speed you control shutter By moving the film you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film movement you control film Do you see now?
