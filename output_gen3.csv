How does photosynthesis work in plants?,"
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to create food (sugars) from carbon dioxide and water.
In plants, this process happens in the leaves, where light is absorbed by chlorophyll. Just like our eyes need light to see, plants need light to make sugar. For this reason, it’s important that they be placed in areas with lots of sunlight.","
