On Sunday, the vibrant, popular fourth-grader died of what at first seemed like a routine case of the virus — leaving his Connecticut community reeling.\nThe Mallozzi family isn’t the only one grappling with flu-related tragedies this winter. At least 20 pediatric deaths have been reported so far, according to the CDC. And the deaths of a fit 21-year-old man in Pennsylvania and a 40-year-old California marathoner have attracted widespread media attention, raising alarm bells about this year’s severe flu season.\nMost cases of the flu will resolve after a few days of fluids, rest and antivirals or over-the-counter drugs. Still, Mallozzi — whose older son, 12, is currently in the hospital with the flu himself, but appears to be doing fine — urges parents to keep a close eye on their kids, and take action if necessary.\nNico came down with what seemed like an average case of the flu last week. Though he was sick, he seemed well enough to accompany his hockey team, the Connecticut RoughRiders, to a weekend tournament in New York, the New Canaan News reports. While in New York, however, Nico’s health took a sudden turn.\n“He progressively got worse,” Mallozzi remembers. “I didn’t like the",

On Sunday, he died from sepsis resulting from pneumonia — a complication of the flu, according to the New York medical examiner’s office.\nThe uptick in total flu cases and complications likely stems from the strain of influenza virus circulating this year: H3N2. H3 strains are more serious than other flu viruses and are difficult to target with vaccines, according to the CDC, leading to particularly bad flu seasons, as in 2012-2013 and 2014-2015.\nThis year, the flu shot was only about 30% effective against the H3 virus, according to CDC estimates. As of the agency’s latest assessment, the entire continental U.S. is experiencing “widespread” incidence of the flu, resulting in almost 23 hospitalizations per 100,000 U.S. residents.",

He was rushed to the hospital again on Sunday, and was placed on life support. He died that night.\nNico’s death has left his family and community in shock. “He was a very happy, loving, caring, compassionate kid,” Mallozzi says. “He was a very good kid. He was a good student. He was a good athlete. He was a good friend. He was a good son. He was a good brother. He was a good grandson. He was a good nephew. He was a good cousin. He was a good friend to everybody.

He was put on a ventilator and rushed into surgery. But the damage had already been done. Nico died on Sunday.\nThe Mallozzi family is now urging parents to watch their children closely for any signs of flu complications. “If you think something is wrong, get them to a doctor,” Mallozzi says. “It can happen quickly.

        "prompt": "It’s no secret that Americans are more demanding of their political leaders, even as they seem to be more easily disillusioned by them.\nOne would need to go back to Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, or Democrat John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s, to find a charismatic president who was well liked and who people seemed to be willing to cut quite a bit of slack in return for inspiration.\nPresidents in recent years have been placed under a fine-tooth comb, and usually are found wanting.\nAmericans criticize their politicians, yet many are unwilling to make the effort to vote, or participate in political parties.\nOne example of this problem was raised recently by John Driscoll of Helena, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Driscoll was concerned that in his travels around Montana, most of the positions for precinct committeemen and committeewomen are unfilled across the state.\nPrecinct committee people represent their neighborhoods on political party central committees. But Driscoll’s figures collected in his travels show that by far most of those spots go unfilled. In Cascade County, for instance, his figures showed 19 people had filed for 152 party precinct committee people slots, or only 13 percent of the total this election year. In 17 of 27 counties in the Upper Missouri area that includes Cascade County, no one filed for party positions at all. Central committees can fill those vacancies later by appointing people.\nMontana State University political science associate professor David C.W. Parker asked what the advantages are to serving as a precinct person.\nIn general, Parker added, “People are less engaged in their civic duties.” At the same time, some voters seem to be more partisan and excited by politics, he said.\nPrecinct committee people serve on party central committees, which can be important, such as when Peggy Beltrone resigned her seat as a county commissioner in Great Falls in 2010, said Cascade County Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore on Tuesday. The Democratic Central Committee appointed new members who helped recommend candidates to replace Beltrone.\nPrecinct positions can be low-key “until some big issue comes up for one of the parties,” Moore said. Then there is “a lot of scurrying around” to appoint precinct people who have some specific power at that point, said Joe Lamson of Helena, state director of the Democratic Party from 1981 to 1983.\n“Filling precinct positions has always been a difficult thing,” Lamson said. He added the new Montana Constitution came up with single-member districts, so rather than file for a precinct committee slot, a volunteer could simply work for a legislative candidate in his or her neighborhood.\nVoter turnout is a better way to judge Montanans’ interest",

A Montanan working two jobs may not have the time to join social or political groups, and that’s not a good thing. The average age of an election judge in Cascade County is 75 years old, she said. It’s harder to interest younger people in such positions, even when they are paid.\n“I think if people want a voice, they should be involved,” Moore said.\nSome folks may be turned off by the nasty nature of today’s political scene, but if they get interested, they could work to better the system.

        "prompt": "The Texas Department of Transportation is announcing changes just nine months after NBC 5 Investigates began questioning why the state was not using safety measures used in other places to help prevent wrong-way crashes.\nThe agency has provided NBC 5 Investigates a copy of a new plan that shows seven highways in Tarrant County will get more than 700 safety improvements, all designed to alert drivers before they go the wrong way.\nImprovements will be made to Interstate 30 through Downtown Fort Worth, Interstate 35W north of downtown, two large stretches of Loop 820, along at I-30 near AT&T Stadium, Texas 360 in Arlington and along SH 199 in northwest Tarrant County.\nThe new countermeasures will include LED signs that flash, alerting drivers they’re going the wrong way, red reflective pavement arrows and “Wrong Way” and “Do Not Enter” signs mounted closer to the ground making them more visible in headlights.\n“This is a significant program that's going to use a lot of different countermeasures in over 700 locations. We feel that a majority of these will lower the risk of wrong-way wrecks,” said TxDOT spokesman, Val Lopez.\nOne recent study run by the North Texas Tollway Authority showed lowered signs reduced wrong-way driving incidents by almost 60 percent. California has used lower signs to reduce wrong way crashes since the 1970s. But, outside of a test project in San Antonio, TxDOT has not used lower signs or LED signs on other state roads.\n\"We do our very best to make the system as safe as possible and, because we affect so many people, we have to be careful,” said Lopez when asked why it took so long for safety changes to come to Texas.\nAs TxDOT waited, worried the new signs might cause new problems, other highway safety experts, such as former U.S. Department of Transportation official Brigham McCown, said the state was simply moving too slow and were taking too long implementing safety improvements.\nIn the last four years, at least 280 people have died in wrong-way crashes and another 2,800 more were injured on Texas roads.\nLast winter NBC 5 Investigates mapped all wrong way crashes in Texas since 2011. Pinpointing many of the same danger zones TxDOT will now focus on in Tarrant County.\nInformation contained in this report represents reportable data collected from Texas Peace Officer's Crash Reports (CR-3) received and processed by the Department as of the report date.\nFederal highway safety laws require the state to create this crash database for use in obtaining federal safety improvement funds. Section 409 of Title 23 of the United States Code, forbids the discovery and admission into evidence of reports, data, or other information compiled or collected for activities required pursuant to Federal highway safety programs, or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project, which may be implemented utilizing federal-aid highway funds, in tort litigation arising from occurrences at the locations addressed in such documents or data. Information that is not available to a party in civil litigation may be confidential under state law.\nFor Motor Vehicle Crash Data Report definitions, please go to txdot.gov and view or download the Annual Motor Vehicle Crash Data Report Definitions report.\nOn I-30 near Beach Street, five people died there in three devastating crashes. One of the victims was the daughter of Tommy and Donna Davila. The couple’s daughter, Sabrina, and her unborn child, were hit by a wrong-way driver who had drugs in her system. Despite delays in safety measures, the Davilas are now thrilled to see action.\n“I’m glad they’re doing this. Man, like my wife said, it’s shocking. It was shocking to us seeing the numbers. I can’t believe they’re doing that many,” said Tommy Davila.\nMore than 170 freeway ramps will get more than 700 improvements that will be paid for with a $600,000 grant from The North Central Texas Council of Governments.\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price supports the plan and said she’d love to have seen the changes implemented before now, but is confident they’ll be installed as quickly as possible.\n“If you can save one life, or even save a family from dealing with significant injuries, it will be fabulous,” said Price.\nThe question now, though",

What about Dallas, Collin, Denton and other counties in the area?\n“This is a pilot program that we're all going to be watching very carefully. We'll share the results of the study and it will really shape policy here in Texas,” said Lopez.\nFor the Davila’s, TxDOT’s decision is now helping make sense of tragedy while giving them hope other families will be spared the pain they’ve suffered.\nThe only way to eliminate most wrong-way crashes would be to end drunken driving since federal and state studies have shown that most wrong-way drivers are intoxicated. But research by the Texas Transportation Institute has also shown some of these road improvements have potential even to get the attention of drunken drivers and prevent devastating head-on crashes.\nThe project in Tarrant County will start in the spring of 2016.",

        "prompt": "SAN FRANCISCO – Cybercriminals have become industrialized to increase their effectiveness. They are increasingly using encryption to cover their tracks and prevent forensic investigators from recovering evidence, according to Joe Stewart, security researcher for SecureWorks.\nStewart, speaking at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco Wednesday, said the criminals are using virtual private networks to siphon stolen information from hacked companies so the stream of exiting data often goes undetected by the victim. They've also wised up to encrypting their hard drives so even when they're captured by authorities, evidence stored on their computers can't be cracked.\nLawrence Baldwin, a security consultant and operator of MyNetWatchman, who spoke on a panel with Stewart, described malware-distribution services that help malicous-code creators infect machines with viruses and keystroke logging programs. The entrepreneurs behind the distribution services control legions of hacked computers corralled into botnets, and charge customers (other hackers and spammers) for the privilege of running their own malware on the hacked machines.\nThe going rate for infection distribution varies from $5 per 1,000 computers in Asia to $130 for 1,000 installations in the United States.\nThe distribution services are just one example of the ways that criminals in the computer underground have become industrialized to trade niche skills and expertise.\nBaldwin also described anonymization VPN services catering to the underground that use hijacked botnet computers to hide a criminal's tracks. Using a VPN client, a criminal can choose any hacked system or node on the botnet through which to tunnel his traffic or access a victim's bank account.\nBank-fraud detection systems generally assume that a legitimate customer will log into his account from an IP address based in the city where he resides. So, a criminal in Eastern Europe who obtains the online banking credentials of a victim in the United States can log into the victim's bank account through a botnet node near that victim's address.

The mule operating a drop address sells the goods on e-Bay or elsewhere, then transmits the revenue (minus a commission) back to the hacker through Western Union or online payment services such as PayPal, Web Money or e-Gold. ATM cashers transmit their revenue the same way.\nRecruitment services operate like temp agencies, allowing hackers and carders to hook up with mules in numerous states or countries. The usefulness of a mule is generally short-lived, however, because they're easily caught on ATM cameras making withdrawals or through stakeouts at drop addresses.

It would be constructed on town-owned land at the northwest corner of State 76 and Parkview Drive.\nThe borrowing is estimated to cost $37.50 annually for the owner of a $150,000 home and $50 annually for the owner of a $200,000 home, according to a town web page about the project. Officials will hold a press conference at 9 a.m. Monday at the fire station, W6895 Parkview Drive, to discuss the referendum.\nThree years ago, voters soundly defeated a referendum calling for $10.5 million in spending for town buildings, including $7.6 million to $8.5 million for a new fire station.\nTown Administrator Joel Gregozeski said a facilities committee has spent the past three years rethinking the plan for the fire station.\n\"They've scaled the project back substantially, and the overall cost is reflective of that,\" Gregozeski told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\nResident Steve Nagy, who rallied the opposition to the 2015 referendum, said the town needs to go much further in reducing the size and grandeur of the new station. He wants to see documentation on how the new building would improve fire protection services in the town.\n\"Do we need an exercise room?\" Nagy asked. \"Do we need a full kitchen? Do we need male and female dormitory rooms? I mean, the whole thing is nuts.\"\nThe footprint of the proposed station includes 2,700 square feet of space for dormitories, but the build-out of that space would occur in the future at a cost outside the $6.5 million.\nThe Greenville Fire Department has two full-time firefighters, 52 paid-per-call volunteer firefighters and 15 paid-per-call volunteer first",

        "prompt": "NEWS ANALYSIS: Chips without the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities are coming this year, said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, during the company Q4 earnings call, but questions continue to arise about a rumored “information embargo” about the processor problems.\nIntel CEO Brian Krzanich directly addressed the questions about the security of Intel processors during the Intel earnings call on Jan. 25 even before reporting Intel’s strong results.\nKrzanich said that Intel is going to focus in the near term on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect customers from potential Meltdown and Spectre exploits. He also added that Intel would incorporate silicon-based changes into its new processor designs scheduled for release later this year to eliminate the threat from Spectre and Meltdown.\nExactly when the additional mitigations or the new processors will appear is unclear. Krzanich did not provide any specifics on when to expect further fixes or in what form they might come.\nThere were also no specifics on exactly when Intel learned about the vulnerabilities, but rumors have been making the rounds that Intel probably learned about the problems during the early summer of 2017 and only admitted to the problems when independent researchers went public.\nIn fact, the rumors about Intel’s secrecy regarding the vulnerabilities have been referred to as an information embargo, suggesting that there was a coordinated effort among several technology companies to keep the vulnerabilities under wraps.\nPublic attention to the alleged embargo has reached the point that Congress has now become involved. On Jan. 24, the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that it was sending a letter to executives at seven technology companies demanding more information on whether the embargo existed, why it took place and whether proper authorities were notified. The companies were Apple, AMD, Amazon, ARM, Google, Intel and Microsoft.\nThe Committee’s letter acknowledged that Intel and the technology industry in general had reacted quickly to fix the problem starting in June, 2017. But the letter also said that some members of the industry had expressed concern about the information embargo agreed to by several companies involved.\n“This embargo restricted the dissemination of information related to the vulnerabilities outside of these companies,” the letter said, noting that originally the information was going to be released in January, 2018.\nThe letter also noted that the embargo raised questions related to the effect and appropriateness of the embargo on companies not originally included in the June 2017 disclosure and thus were caught off guard. The letter questioned why only ten companies were eventually included in the group sharing the information.\nThe letter from the committee also asked a series of nine very pointed questions, starting with why the embargo was imposed, what companies proposed the embargo and whether US-CERT or CERT/CC were informed of the vulnerabilities.\nOther questions requested details on any negative impacts resulting from an embargo on critical infrastructure or other IT companies. Other questions related to lessons learned from such a multi-party embargo.\nEven if the committee gets detailed answers to all of these questions, you can assume there committee will hold a hearing perhaps followed by one before the Senate Commerce Committee as well. The concern is not that the vulnerabilities exist, but rather whether critical users as well as the public at large should have known about them sooner.\nAs it stands right now, it appears that the chip makers were planning to come up with fixes to the vulnerabilities and then just sort of release them without much explanation. This is the reason why the Congressional letter asked about notifications to the IT sector as well as to government users.\nAs the letter points out,",

While it would be wrong to fault the chipmakers for creating processors with a vulnerability that nobody suspected could exist until researchers figured it out, they still have the responsibility to fix it.\nMeanwhile, bad actors are everywhere, especially those with the resources provided to state-sponsored hackers, know what they have to do and know how to do it. The next question won’t be whether such an exploit will exist, but rather who will the first to take advantage of it.\n“This will be an ongoing journey,” Krzanich said during his call, “but we're committed to the task and I'm confident we’re up to the challenge.” Unfortunately for everyone involved, it’s proving to be very great challenge indeed.",

        "prompt": "Apple's New Music Streaming Service Under Antitrust Scrutiny : The Two-Way Investigators want to know if music companies are colluding with subscription services such as Apple Music to squeeze out free, ad-supported streaming.\nApple announced its new music streaming service during the Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month in San Francisco.\nThe same day that Apple did a splashy, star-studded introduction to its new Apple Music subscription streaming service, New York's attorney general posted a letter from attorneys for Universal Music Group indicating that prosecutors are looking at the streaming music business and that Apple is one of the companies being investigated.\nThe letter, from a law firm representing Universal, was addressed to the antitrust bureau of the attorney general's office. It stated that Universal currently has no deals with Apple or companies such as Sony Music that would \"impede the availability of free or ad-supported music streaming services, or ... limit, restrict, or prevent UMG from licensing its recorded music repertoire to any music streaming service.\"\nThe letter did not specifically say Apple was among the targets of the investigation. But Universal's attorneys did say the company was not colluding with Apple or its two major rival labels, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group.\n\"This letter is part of an ongoing investigation of the music streaming business, an industry in which competition has recently led to new and different ways for consumers to listen to music. To preserve these benefits, it's important to ensure that the market continues to develop free from collusion and other anti-competitive practices.\"\nThe investigation centers on whether Apple may have urged the labels to drop support for free, ad-supported streaming services such as Spotify and Google's YouTube. Such a move could be seen as anti-competitive.\nAlbert Foer, the founder of the American Antitrust Institute, says the current investigation may have been sparked in part by Apple's history. The company was found guilty last year of conspiring with book publishers to raise the price of e-books when it launched its online book store. Among those who brought the charges were 33 state attorneys general, including Schneiderman.\n\"The suspicion would be of the corporate culture and how they operate,\" Foer says about why the attorney general would investigate Apple Music. \"It's just that investigators will have suspicions in some cases because of what happened in the past.\" But he says the investigation could also have been triggered by complaints from someone inside the music industry.\nChris Castle, a",

However, Jepsen did not say he'd stopped investigating Apple. And European Union officials are also investigating Apple Music.\nBut Castle says he will be surprised if this goes anywhere. Apple, he notes, has a lot of competition in the streaming music space: Spotify, YouTube, GooglePlay, Amazon. \"There are inquiries all the time\" he says. \"They ask a few questions. You send a response and that's it.\"",

        "prompt": "Trinity United Methodist Church had the choice: Dissolve or be adopted by another church.\nIn 1946, Buddy Hunt helped plant two small oak trees outside of the new Trinity United Methodist Church. He was good labor, back when he was one of the church’s youngest members.\nHunt has watched the trees, now towering oaks, grow through the years as the church members have fallen one by one and in recent years have not been replaced.\nThe pews used to be packed, standing room only, but in recent years the congregation dwindled to fewer than 30 people a week.\nMore than a year ago, the United Methodist leaders in the state told church members Trinity had run its course. It couldn’t keep going.\nSo the congregation was given the choice: Shut down, or give up control and allow another church to come in and run everything. Become a campus, a satellite, a sibling.\nMembers of Trinity believed there was something worth keeping, something valuable behind those oak trees and empty spaces of the church on Augusta Street. They voted, 45 to 15, to seek adoption.\nHunt said adoption wasn’t anyone’s first choice, but keeping the church going meant so much more than keeping control.\nHe said Buncombe hopes to give new life and new members to its newly adopted church.\nHowell is the lead pastor of downtown Greenville’s Buncombe Street United Methodist, a church also surrounded with mammoth oak trees.\nLike Hunt’s oak trees, it takes several people linking hands to reach around the great shade trees outside Buncombe, one of the original churches in downtown Greenville.\nThe churches share a similar culture and have roots going back and forth, from members who have attended both churches to geography and some of the same personality quirks, Howell said. Several years ago, a pastor at Trinity became ill and a Buncombe Street minister would help the congregation.\nThose close ties built trust between the churches, said the Rev. Sara White, director of congregational development for the United Methodist Church South Carolina conference.\nWhite said she expects more adoptions in the coming years as church attendance broadly declines.\nAbout a half dozen United Methodist churches in the state dissolved in the past year and about half as many new churches formed, White said.\nAdoption, rather than starting a church from scratch, is increasingly a way to make something positive out of a failing church.\nThe formal adoption began July 1 at Trinity, when the church became known as Buncombe United Methodist/Trinity Campus.\nThe membership rolls at Trinity are about 300, but it attracts only a fraction. There are about 2,700 members at Buncombe Street.\nA new minister, the Rev. Ben Burt, is now working at the former Trinity campus. Several times each year, Burt, along with two Buncombe Street-based pastors, will rotate to preach another of the three distinct services at the now-unified Buncombe churches.\nEvery Sunday there are competing services at the downtown Buncombe location: traditional inside a glorious old sanctuary and contemporary inside a gymnasium. Trinity's campus has a traditional service and are working to add a second service, likely early next year and likely contemporary.\nThe Buncombe-Trinity adoption is one of two going on now in South Carolina United Methodist churches, along with an adoption by St. Mark United Methodist in Greenwood of a congregation in Coronaca. The adoption process has been gaining ground in the United Methodist family for about a decade.\nThe Rev. Steven Brown, of St. Mark, said the adoption worked a little differently in Greenwood because the other church, the former Bethlehem United Methodist, had voted to dissolve. State church leaders, and Brown’s congregation, saw potential in reviving the 150-year-old building which now hosts a service that's a blend of contemporary and traditional.\nIt’s a supplement to the existing separate contemporary and traditional services at nearly-neighboring sites and marks a third location for St. Mark.\nBrown said the attendance has grown nearly 10-fold, to about 70 members, since services began in March at the new location, now called the Coronaca Campus of St. Mark United Methodist Church.\nHe said the Bible is strewn with examples of dying in exchange for new life, of wheat seeds falling only to create fields and of baby Moses being sent on a river to a new future.\nCatherine Merritt, one of the charter members of Trinity, greeted a Sunday crowd at the newly-renamed Buncombe United Methodist Church at Augusta.\nSeveral dozen Buncombe members came to worship at",

She never wanted it to die.\nAdoption was a tough step, Merrit said, because it meant acknowledging that there were real problems but being adopted also meant that others saw promise and a future in Trinity.\nTommy Sinclair, a lay leader at Buncombe, said Trinity members have likened the adoption to a parent giving up a child to have a better life.\nThe biggest difference, Sinclair said, is that Trinity members will continue to be part of raising this child, this new day for the church.",

Indeed the White House revamped its own e-mail system this summer over a flood of so-called spam.\nClogged inboxes have become a leading irritation among Internet users, an increasing business expense for companies and a popular target for Washington interest before an election year.\n\"Today, it's a nightmare that threatens to overwhelm people's legitimate use of the Internet,\" said Rep. Heather Wilson, (R-New Mexico). \"All the technologies and the filters have failed to keep our inboxes free of junk.\"\nThe House voted without dissent to approve slight changes Senate lawmakers made to the \"can spam\" legislation, which would outlaw the shadiest techniques used by the Internet's most prolific e-mailers, who send tens of millions of messages each day. The bill would supplant tougher anti-spam laws already passed in some states, including a California law that takes effect Jan. 1.\nThe bill was among the farthest-reaching Internet measures approved during Bush's term, which has largely continued the Clinton administration's hands-off approach toward regulating America's technology industry. The last such major legislation was a 1998 law banning websites from collecting personal information from children under 13.\nThe anti-spam bill encourages the Federal Trade Commission to create a do-not-spam list of e-mail addresses and includes penalties for spammers of up to five years in prison in rare circumstances. The Senate previously voted 97-0 to approve the bill.\nThe legislation would prohibit senders of unsolicited commercial e-mail from disguising their identity by using a false return address or misleading subject line. It also would prohibit senders from harvesting addresses off websites and require such e-mails to include a mechanism so recipients could indicate they did not want future mass mailings.\n\"This",

The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail called the congressional effort \"really disappointing.\" The group prefers a law requiring marketers to obtain someone's permission before sending them any e-mails. It said the alternative method of consumers asking marketers not to send them any more messages hasn't worked.\n\"What Congress is effectively doing is ignoring these laws that haven't worked everywhere else they've tried,\" said the group's spokesman, John Mozena. \"This bill fails the most basic tests for anti-spam legislation; it doesn't tell anybody not to spam.\"",

According to GWI, mobile access to social media sites actually overtook traditional PC access in Q4 of 2013, as 66 percent of users accessed their social networks by mobile compared to 64 percent by computer. However, microblogging sites — which include Twitter and Tumblr — are apparently best reserved for the tablet, dominating over both traditional computers and mobile for usage.\nNo matter what the device, Facebook remains top dog across the board overall — account ownership, active usage and visit frequency, across all regions — although it has seen minor decline as other social networks gain mindshare. The key winner in this year’s new class of social networks is Instagram: A nearly 25% rise in active users betwen Q2 and Q4 of 2013 bring the estimated total of active users on the website to more than 90 million. It’s also popular for the kids, too, as teens represent the dominant demographic on the site, with a 39 percent share of active users. According to GWI, the only other social networks that can boast teens as their dominant users are Youtube and Tumblr.\nThat said, Facebook isn’t bereft of teens the way that many media outlets have purported over the last year. Teens are increasingly frequenting newer and less popular websites, including but not limited to Instagram, Quora and Pinterest, and, as a result, more popular networks like Facebook, Twitter and Youtube have all seen slight declines in their teen demographic. But GWI’s data only indicates that Facebook’s teens shrank two percentage points, leaving a rough user estimate of 34.19 million — hardly the apocalyptic numbers released",

The government wants these kinds of lands to be protected so that, “these territories will not become museums, but areas of excellence for sustainable development in which economic activities, conservation of biodiversity and the social and cultural development will form a harmonious whole,” as explained on the website of the Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques.\nAs the president of Sierra Club Quebec, I am one of many local environmentalists attempting to preserve 185 hectares of wet meadows in western Pierrefonds that are extremely valuable for the ecology of Montreal Island.\nAt a recent meeting of Montreal City Council, I asked our municipal leaders whether Montreal had considered seeking to designate the Pierrefonds fields as a “humanized landscape” under the provincial law.\nSuch a legally named landscape involves a commitment by a municipality to a balanced, responsible use of land that protects biodiversity.\nMy question was answered by Réal Ménard, the executive committee member responsible for sustainable development, the environment, parks and green spaces. He indicated that the city of Montreal would not consider designating the fallow agricultural fields of Pierrefonds West as a humanized landscape. Instead, the city plans to allow a 5,500-unit housing development to go forward, ironically branded as sustainable development.\nSierra Club Quebec strongly believes that the Pierrefonds meadows are exactly the type of lands provincial government intended to conserve and not develop — but clearly, Montreal does not see their environmental value.\nThese now idle but re-naturalized fields are characterized by a mosaic of forested areas, wetlands and open areas and are home to countless birds, wetland-related plants, insects, and even such mammals as deer and coyote.\nOne thing that especially characterizes the fields are their wood banks. These lines of trees — including elms, oaks, ashes and maple — are planted next to rills of large rocks hiding salamanders and snakes, with hidden ditches running along them, and some are composed of spiny bushes such as hackberry and raspberry that feed birds in winter.\nAppreciating and managing Pierrefonds West for its current ecological and recreational qualities requires a different approach to nature conservation, and certainly not yet more urban sprawl.\nTo maintain the ecological qualities of the place, parts need to be kept open, without causing too much disturbance to the fauna. That means urban agriculture combined with recreational activities. These precious wet meadows should be a working nature park where children can learn how indigenous people combined squash, beans and corn in a sustainable farming system;",

Rumors circulated earlier this year that IBM and EMC were both considering buying the Dallas-based company in a deal potentially worth $2 billion.\nIBM did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, which it expects to close in the third quarter following the completion of customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances. SoftLayer's majority shareholder is GI Partners of Menlo Park, Calif.\nIBM channel partners said the move certainly makes sense for IBM from a technology perspective, expanding the company's cloud service capabilities.

        "prompt": "Here’s the transcript of this week’s chat at TradingWithCody.com, a service not affiliated with MarketWatch.\nAll right guys, ask me anything.\nQ. Any idea or explanation why some important AAPL suppliers have completely different behavior? QCOM,BRCM more or less are following AAPL (about -10% since their earnings report) and others ( SWKS and mostly CRUS ) growing or stable since their earnings report. Are you aware of involvement in new products? What do you think of gossip on mini ipad this time?\nA. Interestingly, the two that I am most confident about being in future iPhones and iPads is BRCM and QCOM, each of which have much more proprietary technology in their chips than either SWKS or CRUS (proprietary technology increases margins). Mini-iPad or bigger iPhone? I expect over the next couple years that the iPad/iPhone concept converges anyway. Both bigger iPhones and smaller and maybe also larger iPads might all be here in 2015.\nQ. What do you think is more likely before fall: mini ipad or a larger iphone screen?\nA. I’m not sure people want a larger screen. Maybe smaller/sleaker? Maybe both?\nQ. Hi Cody, what are your thoughts about oil going forward? Thanks.\nA. Near-term, I’ve no idea what oil will do or what will drive it. Mid-term, I expect oil to be as cyclical as it always has been and that we will see it trade back down near $50 or so at some point in the next few years. Longer-term, I think we’ll come up with some incredible new energy-enhancing technologies that will make all forms of energy production 10-100x more efficient and that the costs of all energy will drop dramatically. That’s probably not until the 2020s or 2030s though, if I had to put a timeline on such innovation.\nQ. This market is really nerve racking! I’m afraid its going to be like last year?\nQ. Thanks, Cody! Sometimes I just need reassurance and you are the best.\nA. Just because it “feels nerve-racking” doesn’t mean that we’re at a bottom, by the way. Just saying that historically, the time to buy is when the markets are indeed nerve-racking.\nQ. Cody I know that you believe Greece will stay in the EU as do I, but hypothetically what if they don’t? What if they default and just leave? Where does this market go?\nThat said, as I noted this morning and always point out — the markets will likely tank hard if Greece/EU were to finally just recapitalize as they eventually will have to/essentially are already everytime they actually write the value of their debt down to something that reflects the reality of getting paid back…but that will be the greatest buying opportunity of our lifetimes when the markets crash just as rule of law and prosperity and growth are about to return to the economy!\nQ. What do you think the Fed’s next move is?\nA. Two points to make to answer your question. First, did you know that Jamie Dimon is on the board of the New York Fed that’s supposed to be regulating him and his bank? Did you know that the entire Federal Reserve is made up of bank executives from TBTF and other banks and that the only “representative of the public” on the Federal Reserve board is a former/current bank lobbyist? The Fed will always do anything it can to help the banks profiteer/vampire/avoid prosecution/fake their numbers/and anything else the banks can come up with to put money in their pockets in the name of “helping the economy”. The Fed’s mandate is for low inflation and low unemployment. And somehow that now includes endless 0% loans, negative interest rates on reserves (meaning the banks are now paid by the taxpayer to hold their cash and not lend it out to citizens and businesses), buying trillions in worthless mortgage securities using taxpayer money at any price the banks say they are worth, and the other $10-14 trillion dollars in welfare given to the banks in the last five years, which has exploded both the Fed’s off balance sheet debt as well as spiking the Federal Deficit from $8 trillion to $14 trillion in the last five years too. So my answer again is the Fed will help the banks no matter what. On another note, as I’ve often pointed out, you need to even “Flip It” when it comes to the old saying of “Don’t Fight the Fed”. The markets historically rise when the Fed is raising rates and the markets historically have fallen when the Fed is cutting rates.\nQ. I know they are a bunch of crooks for sure, but I also keep in mind Keynes’ dictum that “the markets can stay irrational longer than the individual can stay solvent.” I try to stay out of the way of tsunamis whoever initiates them. Thanks.\nA. Yes, think about that “irrational markets” phrase from Keynes and how it applies to the endless Greece/EU/US bank bailouts. Supposedly, the markets will crash when the banks’ shareholders and executives lose everything even though a washout and a return to rule of law would finally put in a real bottom for this market and the economy. That’s irrational, but it will last until it doesn’t. So we have to realize that even though it’s bad for the economy and the markets in the long run, that the markets will likely spike if Greece re-elects an EU/Bank-bailout/social-austerity government in the next election, as I expect they will.\nQ. Cody, do you have any plans yourself to buy some FB common when it goes public or wait till the options kick in and then play it?\nA. I’ll probably take some FB on the IPO, but it won’t be enough shares to make much impact on the portfolio, so I’ll have to decide what to do when it actually starts trading. If it’s spiked more than 50% when it trades, I’d probably sell the IPO on the first day or so. But if I get the chance to buy any meaningful amount of FB in the low $30s after it comes public, I’ll probably do so. I will let you guys know if and when I trade FB.\nQ. Any renewed interest in Netflix at these levels?\nA. I had to type a NFLX quote into my screen to see what “these levels” are right now.

I remember about seven or eight years ago when Apple was of course one of my largest positions and I got a detailed email from Jeff Macke of Fast Money and Yahoo Finance fame about why I needed to panic out of Apple because the stock chart was crappy and the consumer was supposedly about to stop spending money on tech stuff. I think Apple was at $25 at the time. I don’t read much into the trading of AAPL as an indicator of the next two years.\nA. Yes, I plan on buying more AAPL. I bought more when it was $560 before its earnings report and didn’t take profits higher and therefore discipline in my tranche-trading system dictates waiting for a further pullback before adding yet more. That’s just for me and my portfolio right now though. If you don’t have a near-full-sized position, then I’d be building it right now.\nQ. Do you type all these answers Cody?

Anyway, we were sitting down with a bunch of people for a meeting and I was typing some notes while they were talking and he turns to me and says, “Wow, I don’t know how you can move your fingers that fast and maintain any semblance of order in what comes out of them.” Mind you this is one of the greatest guitarists in the history of guitar playing, which partly depends on having quick fingers.

        "prompt": "Connecting kid favorites like burgers and bacon with their carbon emissions is a real-world lesson in the realities of climate change.\nPresented with an image of a dinner plate and the ability to drag and drop food items to create their favorite meal, a group of eighth-grade boys had little trouble agreeing on what to eat.\n“They had steak, bacon, and a burger as their meal,” said University of Illinois curriculum and instruction professor Emma Mercier. They skipped the potato and broccoli options. “Very typical of 14-year-old boys,” she said.\nThe students were experimenting with Mercier’s Food for Thought app, which dynamically charts the nutritional data and carbon footprint for each food item and assembles the overall meal as a plate. The boys had cooked up quite the carbon load.\n“The burger is actually the worst thing in the world,” Mercier said. Studies have shown red meat requires 28 times more land to produce than pork or chicken, needs 11 times more water, and results in five times more emissions. All in all, not a good choice in terms of climate.\nThe Food for Thought app takes those numbers and puts them in context with two goals: to make kids aware of the causes and impacts of climate change and to help them read and make sense of data in their decision-making process. Climate change is a strong element of the new science standards for students from kindergarten through 12th grade. But after days of curricula about climate change, how does a teacher bring concepts out of the textbook and get kids to understand that this affects their daily lives? Mercier says not to fight the tablet at the dinner table.\n“Every kid has an opinion about food in a way that I don’t think all the other things we talked about were relevant to them,” she said. “We wanted to highlight something that they have direct experiences of,” and technology, she added, has a way of stirring everyone’s enthusiasm.\n\"Using food as the focal point for promoting awareness of climate change was really brilliant,\" said University Laboratory High School science and engineering teacher Sharlene Denos, whose students tested the app.\nEven Mercier and her team of doctoral student researchers were surprised by what they",

As dietary guidelines are beginning to suggest, good health and sustainability go hand in hand, but not all vegetables are equally environmentally friendly.\nMercier pointed out that the app’s intent is not to push a vegetarian agenda but to present data and allow the students to decide for themselves. Food for Thought gives students a sense of the impact of their choices. One student reported she opted for chicken instead of steak for dinner that night with her family—and Mercier now orders her burgers at a restaurant that serves local beef.\nIn future iterations of the app, Mercier would like to include information about food waste.

We tested using very large files, and defragging yielded file access up to ten times as fast as when the files were heavily fragmented.
