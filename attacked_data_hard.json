The growth can be seen locally, with Speedway, which is the largest local company by revenue, also working on a $48 million expansion of its corporate headquarters.\nThe retailer has pledged to add 300 new administrative and office support jobs as part of the project.\nSpeedway is already one of the area’s largest employers with about 1,200 located in Enon, Springfield, and Vandalia and more than 40,000 employees across the U.S.\nAnthony Kenney, Speedway’s president and CEO, said in December that the chain is expanding west of the Mississippi River for the first time in its pursuit of becoming a national brand.\nSpeedway performed well last year, according to Marathon’s fourth-quarter results.

The company is installing Speedy Cafes in many of its stores to serve made-to-order sandwiches and other products, along with its more traditional pizzas, hot dogs and other meals.\nAs a now national brand, Speedway will have significantly more clout when it negotiates contracts with the companies that supply food, drinks and other products for its stores.",

        "prompt": "I have no problem with that. Special interests with a dog in the hunt in virtually any controversial legislation will beat a sponsor's door down to effect the language that tumbles through the committee process. It's absolutely a public service to shine a light on who's pitching policy that could become state law.\nBut we in the media should do it fairly. Do the same homework, apply the same standards to lobbyists on all sides of the issue. If Ceballos had done that, I would be commending her now.\nI'm referring to Ceballos' blind faith in the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\nApparently without checking out the Southern Poverty Law Center's reputation or its long fall from grace, she set this organization as The Authority on hate groups. In truth, though, she's not the only journalist to blindly trust this organization.\nThe SPLC, which enjoys a sterling reputation in the press as a serious and knowledgeable authority on bigotry and extremism in the U.S., does this to great effect with sleek gimmicks such as its infamous “hate maps” and “hate lists,” all of which are shared widely by an extremely eager, fawning news media.\"\nI wish she'd first Googled SPLC, which The New Yorker magazine refers to as \"a highly profitable scam.\"\nWhich constitutional law attorney J. Matt Barber calls in Renew America, \"corrupt to its core.\"\nWhich The Washington Examiner calls \"a scam\" and describes its business model as centering \"entirely around keeping donors in a state of constant, wallet-opening panic.\nThough always left of center, the Southern Poverty Law Center once had a reputation as a fairly objective civil rights group. Founded by direct-marketing millionaire Morris Dees and partner Joseph Levin Jr. in 1971, the SPLC made important and honorable contributions to many of the historic civil rights gains of the 20th Century. According to its own materials, the SPLC was \"internationally known for tracking and exposing the activities of hate groups.\"\nBut its lofty purpose crumbled more than 20 years ago as it transformed into a machine for raising money and launching left-wing political attacks. Dees perfected his money-raising skills by fearmongering with manufactured hate, labeling more and more nonviolent Christian right organizations hate groups, and as the lawsuits against him piled up. Lately the Center has become more of a threat to free speech and civil debate than a defender of the weak or a foe of violent extremism.\nKen Silverstein, writing for Harper's Magazine, addressed this untoward metamorphosis in 2000: \"Today's SPLC spends most of its time -- and money -- on a relentless fund-raising campaign, peddling memberships in the church of tolerance with all the zeal of a circuit rider passing the collection plate. ... The American Institute of Philanthropy gives the Center one of the worst ratings of any group it monitors.\"\nIt doesn't bother me that the NSF reporter uses negative terms like \"hard-line\" and \"controversial\" to describe groups like the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR. But it does strike me as profoundly unfair that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has labeled these \"hate groups\" for no good reason I can find, gets no reality check. None at all.\nPresumably? That's a lot of presuming.\nThe bottom line here is, it's inappropriate for the media to continually cite SPLC as an authoritative source on hate without acknowledging its progressive agenda and conflation of extremist groups with mainstream ones.\nPlease Google the Southern Poverty Law Center for yourself.\nThe SPLC had a good, highly profitable scam going on while it lasted as evidenced by their impressive bankroll, however I think reality has caught up with these fraudsters. They will have to spend a considerable amount of that capital to try and buy back their credibility.\nThe SPLC has become a hate group over the years which needs to be de-funded and pushed to the toilet status of society much like the KKK.\nThis is so silly. The SPLC is a shell of what it used to be and stood for. They have lost relevancy in contemporary and has, in my opinion, zero credibility in what they say and do. They lost their moral authority years ago and integrity as well. Anyone who hitches their wagon to the SPLC now-a-days must be desperate on several levels.\nThere's no more \"hate\" among the people that support the SPLC and the work it does than is evidenced on Sean Hannity's Fox News TV program every night ... EVERY NIGHT!\nSo then, STOP WATCHING HANNITY \"Chuckles\"!\nWell, Breezy, I stopped paying any serious attention to Fox News years ago when I realized it was nothing more than a propaganda tool that Murdoch and Ailes were using to advance their rightwingnut political agenda. Hannity is a disaffected former roofer simply spewing his peculiar variety of hate and venom for a lot of money. There are a couple of other nutcases appearing there regularly who are just as bad as Hannity.\nSo I suppose this newsletter and your readers are experts on the subject of hate groups. These letters confirm you are not an expert on the subject. You are part of the problem at this point.\nThe SPLC has long been an activist arm of the left, on par with Media Matters, Now a number of the members of its leadership have been pushed out for the very type of intolerance they supposedly were fighting against. It is a sham outfit.\nTHE WALL: The Border Patrol, DHS, ICE our Military & the Army Corps of Engineers have all endorsed the need for a wall numerous times almost nightly. Barrack Obama’s own border patrol chief, Mark Morgan, has repeatedly stated that walls work. They free up resources to focus on the points of entrances so they can detect more contraband and illegals. TPS / DACA To Democrats/Progressives/Socialists (whats the difference?) programs like Temporary Protective Status (TPS) or Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals (DACA) are permanent programs. There is nothing \"temporary or deferred\" about these programs to Democrats. These programs are designed to admit refugees (usually from the third world) then Democrats fight to keep them here permanently using the charge of racism, religion, guilt against anyone opposed. Simple formula works great. THE PRICE: Democrats view U.S. citizens as acceptable collateral damage to their future long range goals of flooding the country with refugees & illegal aliens and having taxpayers paying the cost. Democrat politicians and their voters have put families at risk of being victimized by illegal aliens as in the cases Kate Steinly (nothing done) then, Mollie Tibbetts, (nothing done) Police Cpl. Ronil Singh, (nothing done) now Bambi Larson; butchered in her home, nothing will be done...who's next? These victims would be alive today if our border was secured. Most of these killers have been deported numerous times. Bambi 's killer claimed \"amnesty\" to get into the country. Sanctuary city's where you have protection for illegal aliens, gang members, illegal alien felons fleeing ICE. What a place to raise a family. Google search \"illegal alien crime\" or \"victims.\" Preventable victimization's. THE STAMPEDE: Democrats offer rewards, incentives so.....More caravans on the way. The current migration at our border is costing U.S taxpayers a Kings ransom. Fleeing persecution? or fleeing for freebies? they sure don't stay in Mexico when they reach \"safety\" or ask or offered political asylum in Mexico. Why? because Mexico will give them NOTHING. So they make the long journey to our border, our generous Democrats, and our tax dollars. Notice how many have made the long, difficult, dangerous journey to our country 8-9 months pregnant? Give birth on American soil and the U.S. taxpayers will not only pay for the birth of you're child but will also give you state government assistance.\nThe \"Southern Poverty Law Center\" is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for ANY American to be proud of,.. and the word \"sham\" doesn't come anywhere near the lowest description that SHOULD be applied to this despicable organization,... that gives the word \"Southern\" a distasteful connotation..!\nI'm only trying to counterbalance morons like you \"Fart\", who give Florida a bad name that makes everyone think \"It must be something in water that creates so much subnormal intelligence down there..\"\nIn many, many ways, and for a long time, \"southern\" has carried a \"distasteful connotation\", historically, politically, and socially.\nThe SPLC is a disgraceful bunch of haters sponsored by leftists. Look at their list of Christian organizations and people like k.Ali who tells the truth about Islam and Sharia. Worse is the media platforms that depend on their \"lists\". UnAmerican and anti free speech.\nThat's a poem that was written and then put on a plaque years after the writer died because friends of the writer what to memorialize the writer. The only thing actually written on the statue is JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.\nDon't HAVE a dictionary, huh?\nExtreme \"nationalism\" is the foundation of fascism.\nAnd the Democrat party is the foundation of the KKK.\nDemocratic party of 100 yrs.\nOf the 1,020 “hate groups” claimed on the SPLC’s “Hate Map” for 2018, fully 322 are marked only as \"statewide,\" meaning that the SPLC provides no corroborating information, not even a known city or town, let alone any kind of membership headcount, that a journalist, researcher or donor could use to verify the company's claims. That’s 32% of the alleged total right off the top, or almost one-in-three. We just get to take the SPLC's word for it that these \"groups\" are really, really out there with no evidence whatsoever. That's not good enough, and it certainly isn't good journalism. Big claims demand big proof, or any proof, for that matter. Of the 75 alleged \"groups\" the SPLC has assigned to Florida, 21 are \"state",
        "baseline": "wide\" phantoms, including all of the alleged KKK, neo-Nazi and racist skinhead groups. By contrast, the company lists 22 Black \"hate groups,\" none of which are \"statewide.\" SPLC \"hate group\" numbers are for fundraising, not for fact finding.\nOnly wish you would use your considerable talents to addressing the extreme groups spewing hate against African-Americans; our Jewish, Catholic and Islamic faith communities; and others. They are vastly more dangerous than the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nTrue ... and ESPECIALLY in the south!\nI checked up on the hate group in my area. It is one \"Christian\", and I use that term loosely, that hate Jewish people. Guess he forgot that Jesus and his disciples were Jewish. One person spewing hate is very persuasive to some, and can lead to extreme actions. So yes he deserves the label. Just saying. And no, I don't send them $. I support the ACLU.",

The latest report provides loan quality findings for mortgages reviewed by ACES Audit Technology(TM) during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2017 as well as the 2017 calendar year (CY).\n* The distribution of critical defects shifted significantly from 2016 to 2017.\n\"In 2016, the categories containing the majority of critical defects reflected the industry's reaction to TRID, which had been implemented at the end of 2015,\" said Phil McCall, president of ARMCO. \"In 2017, we see a shift away from those categories, toward the types of defects that align with the industry's move to a purchase-driven market.\"\nIn 2017, the majority of critical defects centered around issues associated with core underwriting and eligibility issues, which is reflective of the deeper complexity of purchase transactions, as compared to refinances.\nThe Q4/CY 2017 ARMCO Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report is based on nationwide post-closing quality control loan data from over 90,000 unique loans selected for random full-file reviews, as was captured by the company's ACES Analytics benchmarking software. Defects listed in the report are categorized using the Fannie Mae loan defect taxonomy.\nEach ARMCO Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report includes easy-to-read charts and graphs, a summary that outlines ARMCO's overall findings, a breakdown of defect rates for each Fannie Mae loan defect category, and a short conclusion. ARMCO issues a one-year analysis for the calendar year with each fourth quarter Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report.\n\"When you see how much the issues that impact quality can change quarter to quarter and year over year, it becomes apparent why lenders should use the most current data for strategies going forward,\" said McCall. \"ARMCO provides the Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report for free because we want to arm all lenders with as many tools as possible to achieve quality in the most efficient way possible.\"\nTo obtain a copy of the report, please visit https://www.",

        "prompt": "Remember the infamous scene in Speed where a bus jumps a fifty foot gap in an elevated freeway? Of course you do, because every physics teacher from that day on illustrated that moment as something that could never, ever happen. Although the freeway was elevated, the bus was careening down a flat section. It would have fallen down from the edge of the freeway the same way a ball rolling off the edge of a table would. Gravity doesn't care if you're going very fast. What's more, since the front section of the bus moved off the freeway first, it would have started falling while the back section of the bus was still being supported. This would have sent the bus into a spin, and if the fall were long enough it would have tumbled end over end into the ground.\nBuses don't generally inhabit regions where they can go tumbling end over end, but animals do, and the more likely they are to slip, to jump, or to go into free fall, the more likely they are to have tails. A group of UC Berkeley scientists took a look at this, especially the way leaping lizards use their tails to control their falls and their jumps. The lizards bring their tails up towards their own backs at first, this forces their upper body up and back towards the tail, letting them reach up higher. Later, when lizards notice that they may have overshot their goal, they curl their tails forward and under their bodies, forcing their upper bodies forward and",
        "baseline": " down, again moving towards the tail, and letting them reach down and forward to control their landing.\nThe team, lead by Robert J Full, a professor of integrative biology, decided to do their own version of the Speed jump. They made a little toy car, gave it a tail, and put it on a ramp. At first, when the tail was loose and uncontrolled, the car did just what the bus should have done. Its front end dipped and it went into a spin downwards. By forcing its tail up and forward, it forces the front of its move up and back.

Once more commonly referred to as the pound sign, online use of the hashtag began on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) in the late 1990s, where it was used to categorise items into groups. In August 2007, designer Chris Messina asked his followers how they felt about using the pound sign to group conversations on the micro-blogging platform, and thus became the first person to use the hashtag on Twitter.\n@YouTube maintains its position as the most popular brand on Twitter, with its more than 44 million followers placing it well ahead of all other brands, including the official @Twitter profile.\nDo you remember what we did before Twitter? How on earth did we share small but important messages with our friends and colleagues? With a Post-It note, perhaps?\nDid you know that pictures on Twitter are retweeted 128 percent more than videos? Or that articles with images generate 94 percent more views? What if I told you that 46 percent of people say that a website’s design is their number one criterion for discerning the credibility of that company?\nTwitter experiments with at least one new feature each and every day, and while most of these are simply that – experiments – some do move out of the beta process and become system-wide.

Subsequently, Twitter updated its policy to better explain “What’s a Twitter timeline?” – specifically, it’s now a place where they (Twitter) can add content to your timeline that it deems popular or relevant.\nA investigation by Sky News has found that tens of thousands of new Twitter accounts that are sympathetic towards the Islamic State have been launched on the social network since journalist James Foley was murdered.\nA survey of 11,000 people in the United Kingdom has found that one third (33 percent) comment on Facebook or Twitter about what they’re watching on television during the show.",

        "prompt": "Are you willing to go into debt for love? If you are ready to pop the question, but haven’t saved for the ring you want to buy, you may be tempted to finance the purchase. But do that, and you may find that already pricey engagement ring costs a lot more than you planned.\nThe average engagement ring cost $5,200 and about 12% of couples spent more than $8,000 for an engagement ring, according to the XO Group Inc. 2011 Engagement Engagement & Jewelry Survey. The average ring was 1 carat for the center stone, and 1.4 carats total stones.\nIf you haven’t socked that much away, don’t worry. All of the major jewelry stores offer financing, with many of them promoting interest-free financing for six to 12 months. (No interest, no payments is no longer allowed thanks to the CARD Act.) But there’s a catch: Miss a payment or fail to pay off the balance and you’ll pay a lot more.\nFor example, here is what some of the major jewelry stores are currently advertising*. With all of these plans, if you make one late payment or fail to pay the balance in full during the promotional period, interest will be charged from the date of purchase -- not from the date the promotional period ends.\nJared: 0% interest if paid in full within 12 months; up to 24.99%.\nKay Jewelers: 0% interest if paid in full within 12 months; up to 24.99%.\nWhile interest-free financing may work out fine if you are able to pay off the balance, it is risky if you aren’t able to come up with the cash to pay it off.\nOne more potential trap: Applying for one of the accounts will create an inquiry on your credit reports. Plus, if you accept the financing, you’ll have a new account with a balance listed on your credit reports, and that could potentially have a negative effect on your credit scores. That’s something to keep in mind if you hope to buy a home together soon, for example.\nBuy a less expensive ring and start saving for an upgrade on, say, your fifth or tenth wedding anniversary.\nUse interest-free financing for the initial purchase, then use a low-rate balance transfer to pay off the balance before the 0% store financing ends. I am not recommending this, since you can run into traps here too, but if you pull it off, it’s better than paying 25% or more for long-term store financing.\nGet a part-time job in a jewelry store and save substantially on your purchase. Put all of your earnings toward a ring.\nBuy Shy and Save: Shop for diamonds that weigh just under certain weight thresholds. For example, if you want a 1.0 carat diamond, you can buy a .90 carat diamond and save more than $1,000. And buying shy will hardly affect the diamond’s outward appearance (the diameter of a 1.0 carat diamond is 6.5 mm, whereas the diameter of a .90 shy carat stone is 6.3 mm -- the difference is the thickness of a piece of paper). The price difference between a 1.90 carat diamond and a 2.0 carat diamond can be as much as $5,000!\nHit the Internet: There can be some great deals found on the Internet -- i.e. BlueNile and Union Diamond allow you to compare the going rate of loose diamonds and ring settings based on their grades and styles",
        "baseline": ".\nBuy Loose Diamonds: Don’t be dazzled by the pretty setting, the fancy box or the clever advertisements. Most jewelry ads are selling you on settings, not diamonds, even though the stone is a whopping 90 percent of a ring’s cost. It’s important to buy the stone loose, not mounted, so you can inspect the entire stone.\nDon’t be Afraid to Negotiate: There’s always room for negotiation, so don’t be afraid to go after a deal. Never settle on the sticker price unless you’ve shopped around and you know it’s already a fair price.\nKeep one more thing in mind before going into debt for an engagement ring: You’ve got a much bigger expense coming up soon -- a wedding.\n*This information may have changed from the date of publication.

        "prompt": "It is still very early days to be making such an assumption, but the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch mosque massacres looks like being a somewhat different beast to previous probes accorded that high-level status.\nThe commission’s hearings and findings are likely to amount to much-needed catharsis — and not just for the members of the Muslim community, most of whom will still be stunned by the tragedy.\nMany of them will also be heaped in guilt for having survived the onslaught on everything they hold dear, be that faith, family or whatever.\nAt this point, it should be emphasised that this Royal Commission will not be unique in being a vehicle that brings “closure”— to borrow that tired, overused and consequently devalued term.\nIt would have been the hope of all New Zealanders at the time that the Royal Commission into the crash of one of the national airline’s DC-10 passenger jets in the Antarctic would bring closure to the families, relatives and friends of the 257 passengers and crew who perished in that calamity some four decades ago.\nIt didn’t. That inquiry instead brought angst, anguish and argument.\nIt will be hoped the current Royal Commission into Historical Abuse in State Care and in the Care of Faith-based Institutions will bring some kind of closure for those who spent time in those homes where things horrid were a fact of daily life.\nThose two examples are evidence of something else, however. It is usually the case that the great bulk of the populace is several steps removed from the subject matter under investigation by a Royal Commission.\nWhat makes the inquiry into the events of March 15 different is that they cut about as close to the bone figuratively-speaking as it is possible to get.\nEveryone feels wounded by the atrocity; everyone is struggling to understand how someone could become so devoid of humanity.\nThe inquiry offers a forum for the nation as a whole to confront these demons which — judging from some of the copy-cat behaviour of recent days — lurk not that far below the surface of New Zealand’s at times rather dysfunctional society.\nWithout such a mechanism providing the means to purge and cleanse the national soul, the country will be tempted to keep looking back as much as it wishes to march forwards.\nAdmittedly — and thankfully — the near unanimity displayed by Parliament in tightening up New Zealand’s up-till-now woefully-lax gun control laws has begun the healing the deep wound to the nation’s psyche.\nShame on David Seymour for failing to realise that. Let it be forever on his conscience that when the call came to put the national interest ahead of his party’s interest, he was found wanting.\nLet’s forget about the Act Party, however. Everyone else has.\nThe Royal Commission is countless times more important.\nIt is essential that the country is provided with some mechanism to examine and thus understand how someone could do something so evil.\nThe Commission’s terms of reference, unveiled by the Prime Minister last Monday, guarantee that will happen.\nMuch of the Commission’s resources will be devoted to unearthing every element of the alleged killer’s life which might help to explain what motivated him. Also under investigation will be any links to groups within or outside New Zealand. Without answers, then closure is not possible.\nNeither can closure be found by simply ignoring the alleged mass murderer.\nThat was pretty much the stance adopted by the Prime Minister in the immediate aftermath of the shooting spree.\nIt was the wrong stance.\nJacinda Ardern’s vow that no-one would ever again hear her utter the name of the alleged killer might have been just the kind of evocative and passionate response that circumstances demanded at that time.\nThat statement also amounted to a kind of retaliatory move made on behalf of all New Zealanders expressed in the most civilised, yet firmest of tones.\nShe then implored others to similarly “speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them”.\nThat plea flowed from her view that one of the prime things that the alleged gunman had been seeking from the slaughter of innocents at the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre was notoriety.\nNot mentioning his name would thus deny him that notoriety he was craving.\nIt is within Ardern’s prerogative to hold such an opinion.\nHowever, she appears to have been influenced by the growing calls in the United States for those committing mass shootings not to be named in order to deprive them of recognition and fame.\nIt is claimed some shootings might have been prevented if such “incentives” were removed and that the shooters should be as unrecognised in their deaths as they were in their lives.\nIt is argued that media coverage increases the frequency of mass shootings just as the detailing of suicides boosts the numbers of people resorting to taking their own lives.\nThe trouble with that line of argument is that there is not a thread of scientific evidence to verify such a causal link.\nIn the Christchurch case, moreover, the shooter chose not to follow the standard script which would have had him bringing about his death by his own hand or being cut down in hail of bullets fired by the police.\nThe sense of closure that would have been provided by his death has thus been denied both the Muslim community and the wider populace.\nHis intention may be to have himself put on trial in order to promote his ideology from the platform of the High Court. The moment he tries to do so, however, he would be silenced by the presiding judge.\nHe may well be silenced. But the blunt truth is that the genie of notoriety is out of the bottle.\nWhen someone is facing 50 charges of murder",
        "baseline": " and 39 of attempted murder — numbers which make that person potentially responsible for the largest mass killing in New Zealand’s history — it is pointless to try to stuff that notoriety back into the bottle.\nLike any other miscreant brought before the courts, if found guilty he must be made to accept responsibility for his actions, no matter how unpleasant that will prove to be for the families of his victims.\nThat is even more essential in his case, given the scale and magnitude of his alleged crimes.\nEvery decision made not to mention Brenton Tarrant’s name allows him to further abrogate that responsibility.\nIn summary, every Royal Commission that deals in death and destruction has the same bottom-line. What happened must never happen again.\nWithout being able to see how the pieces in the jigsaw which make that individual what he is, we will never understand the how and why.\nWithout that understanding then make no mistake we risk it all happening again.",

In the past year, she has been featured in articles by The New York Times, ABC.com and MSN Money.\nAt first, saving money was the driving force behind most of her purchasing decisions. Now, Wolk-Stanley says she gives equal weight to the impact on the environment.\n\"Before I knew that I should put in compact fluorescent light bulbs, but I couldn't bring myself to spend the extra money. Now I can see the long-term picture,\" she says.\nWolk-Stanley says she's always been frugal, a habit learned from her father, Portland State professor Tony Wolk.

The Compact was created in 2006 by a group in San Francisco that wanted to combat the negative environmental and social effects of consumer culture.\nWolk-Stanley started posting entries about her experiences on the Yahoo group and caught the attention of a producer booking guests for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"\nWhen the episode's focus changed from how to be frugal to people living beyond their means, Wolk-Stanley was dropped from the lineup.\n\"I was disappointed and relieved all at once,\" says Wolk-Stanley, who says that letdown prompted her to start the blog.\n\"I love Katy's signature line, 'Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without,'\" says Chelsea Norton, who heads the Portland chapter of The Compact. \"She has such a great voice in her writing. You really get a sense of who she is, but she leaves it open so you think 'that could be me,' too.\"\nOnly in the past few years, however, has Wolk-Stanley realized that her penny-pinching has led to more than extra pocket change.\n\"I'm not buying new things, so there's very little product packaging that comes into my house, plus we compost (food scraps),\" she says. \"We get our garbage picked up once a month, and we don't even fill up our 20-gallon can.\"\nAt the same time, quality of life is important.

Frugality is about spending less on things that don't matter so that the money is available for things that do, like travel, good food, charitable giving, education.\"\nThe drawbacks to this way of life? \"I'm not totally sold on buying used shoes,\" says Wolk-Stanley's husband, Dale Montgomery. He also says he's willing to splurge on such things as sports equipment and musical instruments for his kids.\nTheir son Colin Montgomery, 14, has inherited the frugal gene.

Two House lawmakers who are allies of President Donald Trump are set to meet with top intelligence officials Thursday as Trump has raised new suspicions about the federal investigation that is looking into his campaign.\nDonald Trump is catching holy hell for doubting the sagacity of our \"Intelligence Community.\" The ingrate president fails to appreciate all that the CIA, NSA, DIA and so forth have done to safeguard us from foreign perfidy.\nWhy, if the CIA hadn't made the wise call it did on WMD in Iraq, we might have become bogged down in a quagmire war there and in Afghanistan.\nA bipartisan CIA chief, appointed by President Clinton and retained by President George W. Bush, declared it a \"slam dunk\" that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had squirreled away stocks of chemical and biological weaponry.\nThe Intelligence Community chorus chimed in with \"high confidence\" that Iraq was indeed chock-o-block with such nefarious armaments.\nThink what might have befallen our nation had our myriad intelligence agencies been even a little bit less omniscient than they were.\nWhy, heavens to Betsy, we might still have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, even to this day! Why, hells bells, there might even have been a coordinated terrorist attack on New York and Washington!\n….Uh, hold on here. Arms are waving frantically in the back of the room. What's that you say? The Intelligence Community was wrong, dead wrong, about WMD?\nAnd they totally missed those coordinated attacks on New York and Washington?\nWell then, um, never mind. Let's move on.\nAt least our Intelligence Community was on the ball regarding other momentous developments.\nThey gave us a heads-up notice that North Korea, India and Pakistan were on the verge of becoming nuclear-armed nations, right?\nAnd the agencies tipped us off that an Islamic revolution was about to seize power in Iran and that NATO ally Turkey was trending toward militantly Islamic rule.\nAnd they let us know in advance that the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc would soon collapse.\n….Wait, arms are waving again in the back of the room. The Intelligence agencies made none of those calls, you say?\nUh, um, well, let's keep moving on.\nAt least our crack intelligence agencies were on the money regarding other trends.\nThey were able, were they not, to foresee and thwart the rise of ISIS in Syria; the overrunning of the American diplomatic compound in Libya, thereby saving American lives; the chaotic Shia vs. Sunni feuding in post-Saddam Iraq, and the rise of Chavismo in Venezuela?\nMost impressive of all, didn't our intelligence agencies act alertly on information Russia provided us, thereby averting a bloody terrorist scene at the Boston Marathon?\n….There go those arms waving away in the back of the room again. The myopic cartoon character Mr. Magoo could have done a better job at detecting threats, you say?\nOkay, okay. Got it. Nobody's perfect. Even Tom Brady calls the wrong play in the huddle every now and then.\nBesides, aren't there likely other examples where our intelligence agencies courageously took successful measures under dangerous circumstances -- examples that can't be divulged for national security reasons?\nMaybe so. Let's hope, anyway.\nYet it's surely a wise approach to keep in mind that \"assessments\" submitted by the CIA, NSA, DIA, etc., are not like the stone tablets Moses lugged down from Mount Sinai. They're something short of being the word of God.\nIf old Diogenes were to take up his lantern today and resume his search for the elusive honest man, he could skip over the likes of James Clapper, former Nation Intelligence director, and John Brennan, former CIA director.\nThe two are tellers of gross whoppers. And they're inept prevaricators in the bargain.\nAs for Brennan, when confronted with evidence the agency had spied on a Senate committee with CIA oversight authority, he lyingly replied: \"Let me assure you\" the CIA \"in no way\" did any such thing.\nThe CIA IG concluded otherwise. Brennan told a big, fat, knowing, willful, felonious lie.\nYet the Clapper/Brennan whoppers go unprosecuted, even as Robert Mueller's inquisition indicts others for far less egregious falsehoods involving far less significant matters.\nMeanwhile, the Swamp continues to be pretty much ruled by a leakocracy -- especially that portion of the Swamp where the Intelligence Community dwells.\nThe leakers and leakees tend to move in the same Swamp social circles, tend to be habitues of the same Georgetown salons and soirees, tend to collect fees for being talking heads on the same cable shows.\nLeaks can be either a blessing or a curse. They can expose and thwart abuses of power. Or they can help advance abuses of power, often -- as with the Intelligence Community -- by misdirecting attention away from dubious activity and redirecting attention toward vaguely defined \"threats.\"\nAs has long been well known around the Swamp, there are no leakers more adroitly self-serving than those of the Intelligence Community. They can and do advance the policy they prefer with a well placed whisper here, a well placed whisper there. The New York Times, the Washington Post, as often as not.\nJudith Miller, then at the Times, and Jeffery Goldberg, then at the New Yorker magazine, were among the Bigfoot journalists gulled, or persuaded, into purveying the Intelligence Community's line in favor of an all-out U.S. plunge into Iraq.\nThe Intelligence Community continues to favor endless U.S. interventions in such remote hellholes as Afghanistan and Syria, continues to favor interposing American troops between cutthroat factions in distant Islamic civil wars.\nThe Deep State delusion -- now backed by an odd-couple alliance of stick-in-the-mud neocon Republicans and anti-Trump Democratic partisan simpletons -- is that squabbling Muslims, ferociously intolerant of any views but their own, can one day be brought around to thinking like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. All that's needed is the expenditure of a few hundred billion more tax dollars and few thousand more dead or crippled Americans.\nIf Trump resists embracing this ongoing delusion, well, then, he'd better brace himself for a tidal wave of Deep State leaks.\nIf the Deep State knows one thing, it's how to protect its turf. Its out-of-bounds activities were exposed and chronicled in voluminous detail by the Senate's Church Committee in the 1970s.\nYet here the Deep State is today more powerful and less accountable than ever.\nThe media",

For the two the routine brings to mind the biological term symbiosis -- mutual existence based on interdependency.\nIn this role it's difficult for the media to maintain its symbiotic relationship with the Intelligence Community yet also fulfill its obligations of skepticism and nonpartisanship to the public.\nSharyl Attkisson, Emmy Award-winning investigative reporter, author and host of the \"Full Measure\" program, noted this discomforting truth in a recent article in The Hill.\nShe pointed out a media tendency to \"dutifully parrot\" Intelligence Community views \"in one-sided accounts with no counterpoints.\"\nIntelligence Community media leaks often make it seem, she added, that intel officials are \"beyond question,\" that they couldn't possibly be capable of offering flawed assessments or views compromised by political motivations.\nCynicism may not be the recommended antidote, but a little more skepticism surely wouldn't hurt.",

        "prompt": "(Reuters) - A genuine mystery has been hiding in 30 years of data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, according to a newly released draft study by University of Connecticut law professors Alexandra Lahav and Peter Siegelman. According to the law profs, the winning rate for plaintiffs in civil litigation in federal courts declined drastically and steadily between 1985 and 1995, from about 70 percent to 30 percent.\nWin rates recovered a bit in the late 1990s before dipping again, though not as consistently or precipitously. In 2009, plaintiffs prevailed in only 35 percent of the civil cases in federal court that ended in any kind of judicial determination, including dismissal, summary judgment, default judgment or judgment after a jury verdict. That 2009 rate, according to Lahav and Siegelman, is a drop of more than 50 percent from plaintiffs’ success rate in 1985. If plaintiffs had continued to prevail at 1985 rates across the 24 years the professors evaluated, they would have won 377,000 more cases than they actually did.\nSo what accounts for a drop Lahav and Siegelman call “astonishing”? That’s the mystery: As the professors explain in the paper, entitled “The Curious Incident of the Falling Win Rate,” there’s no single, testable explanation for the dramatic decrease in favorable outcomes for plaintiffs. And that itself is a reason to worry about what the change means.\nLahav and Siegelman considered and rejected (with far more quantitative literacy than I possess) some obvious and not-so-obvious possible explanations for the drop in plaintiffs’ win rate. It’s almost certainly not a clerical quirk, for instance, or a shift in the kinds of cases that plaintiffs have filed in the past 30 years. Win rates have declined across almost the entire spectrum of federal civil litigation, the professors found, and no single category of litigation can account for a shift discerned from millions of case outcomes. Even Social Security claims, in which plaintiffs experienced a win rate decline of more than 35 percent between 1985 and 2009, account for only 7 percent of the cases in the data set.\nThe professors similarly cast doubt on the hypothesis that defendants are successfully contesting more cases. “What change in the background rules or culture could explain such a change in strategy? We are unaware of any change in the law on the books, or in other factors such as litigation costs, that might predict such a large and consistent decline,” they wrote. Moreover, the adjudication rate has actually fallen since 1980, suggesting that defendants are actually more likely to settle than to fight.\nAs you’ve probably realized, the elephant in the room (or, in this case, the study) is judicial attitudes. Lahav and Siegelman describe previous legal scholarship identifying “an increasingly hostile view of litigation that began to be seen in judicial decisions in the late 1970s, as well as greater emphasis in the federal courts on settlement.” It’s possible, their paper said, that in the critical time frame of 1985 to 1995 judges were more skeptical of plaintiffs’ claims and more likely to enter judgments for defendants.\nIn an interview Wednesday, Lahav and Siegelman emphasized the difficulty of measuring the impact – or even proving the existence – of changing judicial attitudes. For that reason, both of the professors said, they are extremely wary of inferring system judicial bias against plaintiffs’ claims. “I’m an academic, I don’t like to speculate,” Siegelman said.\nNevertheless, the professors said, it’s worrisome that no other explanation accounts for the marked decline in plaintiffs’ win rates. As Siegelman, the team",
        "baseline": "’s quantitative expert, explained, if systemic developments were occurring randomly, you’d expect some to favor plaintiffs and others to favor defendants. But the data indicate changes in case outcome all point in the same direction – against plaintiffs. That outcome, Siegelman said, is akin to flipping a coin and always coming up heads.\nLahav and Siegelman said they’d like to come up with a way to quantify any change in judicial attitudes but need additional data from the U.S. courts to do it. The federal court system does not release judge-by-judge case outcome information, the researchers said. That’s an understandable decision, since practicing lawyers would surely use such data to try to steer cases toward particular judges. Lahav and Siegelman said the courts could, however, come up with ways to make data accessible to academics without exposing it to practitioners.\nThe professor have not yet submitted their paper to law journals for publication.",

        "prompt": "Following a $1 million seed round, UK money transfer startup Azimo has made good on its promise to begin expanding to other parts of Europe. Today the company has officially rolled out in Germany and Ireland, adding to the number of countries where users can send money from. The service already supports 190 destination countries around the world.\nLaunched in August 2012, Azimo is attempting to take on the remittance industry by letting users transfer money internationally to friends, family or other contacts via the Web, its mobile apps or Facebook, charging between 1% and 2% of the transaction, which is significantly cheaper than the rates charged by the likes of Western Union, PayPal or indeed the banks. The recipient receives the money either in their bank account, at local cash collection points, or as “mobile wallet” top-up credit.\n“While Azimo’s international money transfers are available to all, the most common use of the platform is migrant workers making remittance payments to friends and family. Transferring money is an expensive business, and often it is some of the poorest people who need to make these remittance payments,” notes Michael Kent, CEO and Founder of Azimo, in a statement.\nThe UK startup says that Germany is the world’s fourth largest remittance market — worth an estimated $15 billion a year, and is pinning growth on this newly-entered country. Kent also says, having built out its technology and product line, the company is “in a position to expand into many more markets very quickly”, and that it’s seen its customer numbers double every quarter since launch. Along with Germany and Ireland, France, Spain and Netherlands have previously been pegged to follow on the company’s roadmap.\nMeanwhile, Azimo’s expansion is further signs of the European money transfer market heating up. Last month, Dublin-based peer-to-peer currency exchange CurrencyFair raised a further $2.5 million led by Frontline Ventures, money it says will be used for further product development.\nJust a few weeks earlier Lithuanian-based TransferGo, which also operates a P2P model to undercut the banks, announced it had raised a modest €200,000 in funding to launch in the UK.\nThen of course there’s London-based TransferWise, backed",

In October it announced that it had processed £250 million worth of transfers through its platform since launch in early 2011, up from £125 million in four months, and is now transferring more than £1 million a day.\nHowever, to put that into context, 2009-founded CurrencyFair claims to have done £500 million in money transfers since it began trading.\nInterestingly, Azimo recently won a “€1m advertising budget” as one of the winners of the SevenVentures Pitch Day at the NOAH Conference 2013. The prize consists of TV media on channels owned by Germany’s ProSiebenSat.1 Media.\nI’ve also heard that TransferWise has been working with Squadron Venture Media for media planning and buying, and other advertising support, on what I understand to be a revenue share based on ROI.",

He asserted that the ability for small organizations to eventually develop into big businesses that would be an advantage for Alibaba, if they are ready to signed on early basis to sell the company’s platforms.

The top contenders were visited by judges from Greene King, headquartered in Bury St. Edmonds, England.\nThey tasted fish and chips for a week, judging batter consistency, fish freshness, chip texture and how well the dish complemented \"Old Speckled Hen.\"\nThe two local Pubs in Rookwood Commons and Crestview Town Center are having Fish and Chips awards parties 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on April 11 with half-price fish and chips, live entertainment and $3.25 Old Speckled Hen.

It will be in Urban Sites’ Film Center Project at the entrance to Findlay Market.\nIt will be big, around 9,000 square feet, and will offer a variety of beers that are brewed onsite as well as at the big brewery, including Cincinnati-inspired lager 513, and Sam Adams favorites such as Boston Lager, Summer Ale and Oktoberfest. Plans are for the tasting room to open in fall of this year.\nA new bagel shop called the Bagelry will open this August or September at 1401 Walnut St. in Over-the-Rhine.\nThe shop is new, but the business isn't. Richard Huff has been making bagels at home for the last five years, and as the Bagelry since 2017. He mixes the dough, lets it rise overnight, then boils and bakes the bagels at the Findlay Kitchen, a food business incubator.\nThe Bagelry has been selling bagels at farmers markets, craft fairs and pop-ups, and will continue to until the store opens.\nThe store will just sell bagels to go, bagel sandwiches and coffee, no seating area. \"We'll offer Cincinnatians the basic good flavors – sesame, poppy, onion, everything, cinnamon, raisin, a whole wheat variety,\" said Huff.\nHotel Covington, the hotel on Madison Avenue that is built on a sense of place, has hired a new chef.

It was a scene that played out in many U.S. cities, some of which were running out of fuel in what began to feel like a repeat of the 1970s-1980s oil crisis.\nSeveral Southeastern cities that rely on deliveries of fuel from the Gulf of Mexico couldn't meet customer demand Wednesday as drivers raced to tank up.\nAt the Murphy USA gas station in St. Cloud, Fla., near Disney World, 30 or more cars were backed up waiting to fill up. The station blocked its entrances with cones.\nAt the Darnestown Road Shell station in Gaithersburg, Md., a gallon of gasoline sold for $2.85 on Wednesday morning. By 3 p.m. Wednesday, it had climbed to $3.20.\nHigh gas prices hurt the economy because money spent on gasoline can't be spent on other things. That drags on consumption, which has a domino effect throughout the economy.\nIn a statement to Knight Ridder, Ben Bernanke, President's Bush's chief economic adviser, suggested that previous crises such as the 2001 terrorist attacks proved that the U.S. economy is resilient.\n\"As long as there's not permanent damage to our energy infrastructure, the effects on the overall economy should be fairly modest,\" Bernanke said.\nBut forecasters already are knocking down projections for U.S. economic growth because of Katrina.\n\"Right now, given the information that we've got, we've lowered our second-half projection to 4 percent annualized, essentially shaving off half a point,\" said Steve Cochrane, who specializes in regional economies for the West Chester, Pa.-based consulting firm Economy.com.\nEnergy prices are likely to sock it to the economy at least for the next month, as oil producers and refiners along the Gulf Coast try to restore operations.\nIndividual companies have said little about the extent of damage to offshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, where a third of U.S. oil production takes place. The Minerals Management Services, part of the Interior Department, estimates that Katrina shut down 95 percent of Gulf of Mexico production.\nThe oil industry put motorists on notice Wednesday. Red Cavaney, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the major oil companies, said in a statement \"it is becoming increasingly evident that the impact of this devastating storm on oil and natural gas operations will be significant and protracted.\"\nThose were just the words oil traders had hoped not to hear. Contracts for future deliveries of oil traded in the $70-a-barrel range most of the day before retreating in volatile trading to close at $68.94.\nMarkets mostly shrugged off Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman's announcement that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be tapped to lend at least 1.5 million barrels of oil to at least three Gulf Coast refiners. The reserves hold about 700 million barrels of oil in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana.\nIn another move intended to calm fears of gasoline and oil shortages, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Steve Johnson said Wednesday that he'd relax environmental restrictions on motor fuels nationwide, meaning that more gas can be imported or produced in the United States.\nThose actions help, but energy analysts said oil supplies were only part of the problem. Pipelines aren't pumping, and power is out at many refineries.\n\"In the short term, the main market problem at the refining level is the shortage of product, not inputs. It's mostly a problem of product (gasoline), not crude oil,\" said Antoine Halff, the director of global energy for the risk analysis firm Eurasia Group.\nBreakaway oil rigs and damage to port facilities that supply offshore oil activities mean oil and gasoline prices are likely to stay high and could go higher.\nKatrina's economic impact is being felt far from the Gulf Coast. Barge operators in Missouri and farmers in Iowa are worrying about how long the Mississippi River might be closed to barge and ship traffic.\n\"",
        "baseline": "A lot of our grain here goes down the river to the Gulf of Mexico, and we don't know how long it is before the ports down there open,\" said LuAnn Robinson, a grain negotiator for the National Farmers Organization in Ames, Iowa. \"There's going to be piles all over if we can't ship down the river.\"\nBarge operators don't have anywhere to drop off the last stored grains, and the fall corn harvest begins in less than a month.\n\"All the facilities are knocked out. We can get everything but there are no facilities down there,\" said Bruce Engert, the general manager of the Missouri Barge Line Co. in Cape Girardeau, Mo.\nGulf Coast ports in Texas are scrambling to handle cargo that must be diverted from Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\"This will not be cleaned up quickly. This is going to be a slow process,\" said Floyd Gaspard, the director of the Port of Port Arthur, Texas.",

As part of the Hack the Air Force 2.0 effort, 106 valid vulnerabilities were discovered, with the Air Force paying a total of $103,883 in award to security researchers. The first Hack the Air Force program in June 2017 resulted in $133,400 in awards that were paid to security researchers.\n\"This is the first time that we've had Department of Defense personnel on site in a live hacking program,\" Alex Rice, co-founder and CTO of HackerOne, told eWEEK. \"We have done the bug bounty programs remotely in the past, which is common and this was the first one to start off with a live event.\"\nThe live event was a single day activity on Dec. 9, 2017 that kicked off the 20-day Hack the Air Force 2.0 challenge. The results of the challenge were not publicly disclosed until Feb. 15. The live event was the single most prolific day of the 20-day effort, with 55 of the 106 total vulnerabilities reported that day.\n\"The Hack the Air Force programs are against publicly facing assets, things that you can get to from the internet, \" Rice said. \"They're all un-classified systems.\"\nThe biggest single award issued as part of Hack the Air Force 2.0 initiative was $12,500 for an exploit chain that was demonstrated at the live event. Two security researchers made use of a vulnerability in an Air Force website to pivot onto the Department of Defense's unclassified network.\nHackerOne has been working with the Department of Defense on bug bounty programs since 2016, when the first Hack the Pentagon program was operated. The bug bounty programs have continued and expanded in the years since, with specific programs for the Air Force and the Army.\n\"One of the trends we're seeing with the Department of Defense programs is that",

In his view, the more open a bounty program is, the better the outcome.\nThe experience with managing bug bounties for the Department of Defense have helped to inform and improve the overall HackerOne platform as well.\n\"One of the things we have learned is that one size does not fit all. There are a lot of different ways to run programs to engage with the hacker community in meaningful ways,\" Rice said.\n\"It's kind of stunning the number of different ways you can work with the hacker community today and that trend will continue,\" Rice said. \"Organizations get value from collaborating with hackers and the exact way that happens is really based on what works best for the company and the particular asset they want tested.\"",

        "prompt": "A look at what the experts were saying during Allen Lazard's time at the Senior Bowl.\nAllen Lazard used his strength and size to overpower defenders and overwhelm everyone watching the former Iowa State star throughout the week.\nThe ex-Cyclones star put his big frame and huge hands on display during practices and during Saturday’s Senior Bowl.\nLazard checked in at 6-foot-4, 227 pounds and owned the biggest hands of any wide receiver at the event, at 9 7/8 inches.\n#UCF WR Tre’Quan Smith has longer arms (34 1/2”) than several OT prospects here. Longest arms among WRs.#IowaState WR Allen Lazard has the largest hands (9 7/8”) among this WR group.\nDuring practices: Lazard struggled with drops early on during the first day but started to pick up momentum toward the end of the workout, and it carried over into the second day. Lazard showcased his big fame and was pretty much unstoppable in jump ball situations. The biggest moment may have come when he connected with quarterback Baker Mayfield for a highlight-reel grab in the end zone on Day 2. Mayfield tossed a fade to the corner and Lazard was able to overpower 5-foot-10 North Carolina cornerback M.J. Stewart with his body and rip the ball away from him as he fell to the ground. On Day 3, he had a similar grab when he leaped above 5-9, 182-pound Southern cornerback Danny Johnson for a catch in the end zone. Despite the slow start, former NFL player Bucky Brooks wrote for NFL.com that he liked he saw from Lazard on the first day, in terms of athletic ability: \"Iowa State WR Allen Lazard caught my eye,\" Brooks wrote. \"I like the way he snatched the ball in traffic. He has a great combination of height, weight and speed, which could make him a very intriguing prospect for NFL teams looking to add another weapon to the passing game.\nStandout of today’s North Team practice: Iowa State WR Allen Lazard. Just snagged his third high-point TD of the day. Last one came in back corner of EZ on drill from five-yard line.\nDuring the game: The practices turned out to be Lazard's time to shine. He started Saturday's game but played a small role in the loss for the North, with the offense spreading the ball out to 11 different targets who saw catches. He grabbed two passes for seven yards and was targeted only three times. The only target that didn’t result in a catch was on a bad throw by quarterback Josh Allen.\nThe big takeaway: ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said before the Senior Bowl that Lazard could go early-to-mid Day 3 of the draft. The second and third rounds of the draft are on",
        "baseline": " Day 3. The biggest knocks on Lazard are his speed and his drops, and those two things could stop him from moving past where Kiper had him projected. Lazard showed he does have some speed to him when he flew by cornerback Michael Joseph and chased down an easy catch on his way to the end zone during practice. But it just hasn't been consistent enough. The first day also showed that drops still creep up at times on Lazard, but he also showed the rest of the week that they wouldn’t shake him when he started making grabs throughout the middle of the field and the end zone. He also proved that he always finds a way to come up with catches in the end zone.

        "prompt": "Canada has a rich history of innovation, but in the next few decades, powerful technological forces will transform the global economy. Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being. The FP set out explore what is needed for businesses to flourish and grow. Over the next three months, we’ll talk to some of the innovators, visionaries and scientists on the cutting edge of the new cutthroat economy about a blueprint for Canadian success. You can find all of our coverage here.\nAgropur Cooperative, the maker of OKA cheese and Natrel milk, is what what a free-market economist might call an outlier.\nThe Longueuil, Quebec-based co-op is owned by about 3,300 members of Canada’s “dairy cartel,” which is how many of the dismal scientists on Twitter describe the 13,000 farms responsible for almost all of the lactose in the Canadian diet.\nProviding the raw ingredient for cheese, ice cream and whey powder is an unusually tough business. However, Canada’s dairy farmers endure their daily dawn-to-dark rituals comforted by the knowledge that they will be spared the vagaries of supply and demand. Government-sanctioned production quotas ensure that fluid-milk prices exceed the cost of production and a massive tariff wall keeps all but a small percentage of imports at bay.\nThe disciples of Economics 101 say that such cushiness dulls the desire to innovate. Money that could be spent on the newest farming techniques instead is used to lobby politicians to keep milk prices high. You might do the same if you were a dairy farmer. Their expenses ate up 77 cents of each dollar they made in 2015, according to Statistics Canada’s latest Census of Agriculture. The expenses-to-receipts ratio was better in 2010, when it was 0.73, but milking cows remains the easiest path to a decent income in primary agriculture, assuming you own a decent amount of that quota. Growers of grain and oilseeds do ok; their ratio was 0.79, compared with 0.76 five years earlier. The rest of Canada’s farmers struggle to earn a profit. Beef ranchers and sheep-and-goat herders barely cover their costs, according to the census.\nBack to Agropur. The co-op was angered by the new North American trade agreement, as the price of peace with the Trump administration was more duty-free dairy imports. Still, it’s hard to demonize Agropur’s owners as coddled rent seekers whose idea of innovation is finding new ways to elect sympathetic politicians. The 80-year-old co-op is remarkably ambitious for an outfit that could do fine by collecting inflated payments for its wares from a captive audience. It has developed all sorts of products beyond milk, and it operates 39 plants in eight provinces and six states, generating sales of more than $6 billion in 2017. Nor is it content to rest on its achievements. In October, Agropur started North America’s first accelerator for dairy startups, selecting five entrepreneurs, including the founders of a Montreal-based provider of do-it-yourself cheese kits and a San Francisco-based maker of high-fat, low-sugar yogurt.\n“We cannot be reactive to innovation,” Robert Coallier, Agropur’s chief executive, told me in an interview on Oct. 31, by which he meant the co-op intends to be a leader, not a follower. “We’re pretty unique,” he acknowledged.\nIndeed. The economics textbooks aren’t wrong when it comes to assessing the effect of excessive coddling on a company’s entrepreneurial spirit. “Canada has generally not been a significant creator of new primary agriculture and food processing technologies,” officials at Agriculture Canada state in documents obtained recently by the Logic through the Access to Information Act.\nThat assessment wasn’t directed at milk producers specifically, but there is reason to think that Agropur is the exception that proves the rule. Canadian dairy farmers feel little impulse to even achieve economies of scale: the average herd consisted of 79 cows in 2016, an increase from 62 a decade earlier, but still tiny compared with typical operations in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S., where individual farms tend to manage hundreds of cows. The Canadian industry’s general contentment with staying small means those in the milk business who want to grow must go overseas. Saputo Inc., the big Montreal-based dairy processor, is spending hundreds of millions of dollars outside of North America in order to win",
        "baseline": " a piece of the fast-growing Asian market.\nThat path probably won’t lead to the dismantling of supply management because the U.S.’s heavily subsidized dairy farmers would flood the Canadian market. But we might end up with a system that favours the most efficient and innovative farmers, as the Trudeau government has identified agriculture and agri-food as an industry that should be generating more exports and wealth.\nAgropur’s recent history suggests innovation is possible within a supply managed system so long as its benefactors are a little uncomfortable. The co-op got truly serious about developing and commercializing new ideas a few years ago, according to Dominique Benoit, vice-president of institutional affairs.

        "prompt": "Update: PoliticsPA obtained a copy of the polling memo from Schwartz’s campaign (below), which held a press call on the poll Wednesday afternoon.\nMark Bergman is leaving his position with Schwartz’s direct mail firm to serve as her campaign spokesperson.\nBergman said the campaign released the polling today not in response to the changing race (i.e. Wagner’s interest), but instead because they wanted to complete the primary and general polling.\nSchwartz’s name ID was the strongest of the 4 candidates tester. Schwartz (37% favorable, 7% unfavorable); McCord (21% favorable, 6% unfavorable); McGinty (22% favorable, 4% unfavorable); and Wolf (17% favorable, 7% unfavorable).\nAsked which Dem has the ability to beat Corbett, respondents said Schwartz (36%), McCord (21%), Wolf (19%) and McGinty (9%).\nCorbett’s job approval was negative, but only slightly (50% disapprove, 46% approve).\nThe most interesting aspect of the poll was that it dealt directly with Schwartz’s past work at a Philadelphia health clinic that provided abortions.\n“A lot of people have said, variations on the theme, that they think that Allyson Schwartz is going to have difficulty winning the general election because of her work with the Blackwell Center,” said pollster Pete Brodnitz.\nHe said that when the campaign has the chance to push back against the initial stigma, they win. Of the two issue descriptions below, respondents chose the pro-Schwartz response 51% to 33%. They broke out white Catholics, who supported the Schwartz position by 56% to 29%.\nHere are the competing questions the pollster asked.\n1) Supporters of Tom Corbett say prior to running for Congress, Schwartz ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia. In Congress and the State Senate, she has pushed a pro-abortion agenda, including opposing parental notification, supporting partial birth abortions, and voting against the Religious Freedom Act.\n2) Supporters of Allyson Schwartz say she helped found the non-profit Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center to provide access to quality, affordable health care. While the center did provide legal abortion services, Schwartz’s goal was to reduce the number of abortions by helping women get access to better health care and contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\nAllyson Schwartz’s campaign wants Jack Wagner, the former Pa. Auditor General who this week floated the possibility of running for Governor, that there isn’t room in the Democratic primary field.\nAn internal poll released by Schwartz’s campaign to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette shows the Congresswoman ahead of her rivals in a multi-way Democratic primary.\nA second internal poll shows her ahead of Gov. Tom Corbett in a general election.\nIn a four-way matchup of candidates for the Democratic nomination Schwartz takes 34% to 15% for former DEP Sec. Katie McGinty, 11% for former Revenue Sec. Tom Wolf, and 10% for state Treasurer Rob McCord. 30% are undecided.\nSchwartz pollster Beneson Strategy Group polled 800 likely 2014 primary voters from July 16 to 18. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.46%.\nSchwartz lead in Philly with 61%, but more narrowly in Pittsburgh with just 15%.\nThe general election poll showed Schwartz leading Corbett 49% to 41%.\nIt was conducted more recently, from August 6 to 8. It included 600 likely general election voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.\nAs with any internal polls, the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Schwartz’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests by PoliticsPA to see the polls.* The information released to the Post-Gazette appears to have been only a polling memo. Pollsters often craft two memoranda about a survey: one for the public, that plays up the favorable results of the poll; and one for the campaign, which paints a more nuanced picture.\nTiming is everything. Schwartz waited until Wednesday to release a poll that was conducted more than a month ago – and she released it first to Wagner’s home town newspaper. The biggest change in the race since the poll was conducted in mid-July is the emergence of Wagner as a possible candidate.* He told several reporters that he would soon decide whether to run.\nSo far, the Democratic primary field lacks a western Pa. candidate. None of the dozen declared or undeclared candidates resides more than 15 miles west of the Susquehanna River.\nWagner, a well known western Pa. Democrat (who finished 2nd in the primary for Governor in 2010) would significantly alter the dynamics of the campaign. Indeed, Schwartz’s poll found 48% of Democratic primary voters in the Pittsburgh region were undecided.\nThe memo release could also be a final effort to dissuade McCord, who is widely expected to formally jump into the race sometime after Labor Day.\nI encourage Allyson not to run from her abortion record, but to run on that record. Her standing with white Catholics is very encouraging in this regard. I believe the voters are ready to endorse a candidate who will kead on the issue of reproductive justice. With this position she will gain the support of many women’s advocacy organizations.\nAllyson is in panic mode because she understands that her support is wafer thin.\nThe Pro Life issue will not move any voters from the established positions and, unlikely, to be decisive.\nI see Marcellus Shale drilling and production as a defining issue although I am not optimistic that Team Corbett can present Gov. Corbett’s leadership effectively. 2) Pension Reform which Allyson Schwartz will say she is for but everyone knows is not. However, the Rs have lost credibility on the issue as well so this is a draw and 3) Vouchers for All to give parents real control over their kids education and bring the quality and affordability that comes from competition to education. Again, the Rs credibility is not strong and Tom Corbett has not led. I think it comes down to Marcellus Shale v. Sandusky for Corbett.\nThe fact that Allyson has been silent on the question of whether she referred clients to notorious abortionist Kermit Gosnell speaks volumes.\nHad the question been “which Dem has the BEST chance”, then the result might make sense. Otherwise, it means only 36% think Schwartz can beat Corbett.\nThe question of who can beat Corbett should allow for selection of multiple candidates. Then you might see several candidates selected 70%.\nAny candidate with western PA to himself/herself would blow the race wide open. Sort of Scott Conklin for LG (almost western PA, definitely not Philly) on steroids.\nCong. Schwartz is definitely accomplished, but how does she have higher name recognition (by 15+ points) than a statewide row officer? Seems fishy.\nI agree with Robert G. Hangar has the best policies while Wolf has the best story. I think Hangar could win but he needs to get his message out.\nSchwartz has a lot of work to do. The “house parties” were a big bust and this was confirmed by multiple sources. McCord needs to declare and start to campaign.\nI hate to say this but this poll maybe skewed to women. Why else would McGinty come in second?\nThey also leave out John Hanger. What he may lack in name recognition he makes up for in good policy plans. Instead of just going for the person that is most well known (for now), I hope that Democrats do the research and discover which candidate will actually do the most to help PA since just about any Democrat can beat Corbett at this time.\nschwartz critz ticket game over.mcc",

It is unfortunate for PA that we will be losing her seniority in Congress.\nShe needs to ABORT her campaign.\nThe Republicans better get it together FAST and jettison Corbett ASAP before it is too late and Schwartz gets to far ahead in the money race. A bold move by Republicans now with a new candidate would really energize Republican and independent voters. The clock is ticketing!!!!\nMcCord isn’t going to be dissuaded by a month-old internal poll.\nReleasing such an outdated internal poll shows fear, weakness or both.",

        "prompt": "When I speak with Tom Switzer, he tells me he’s envious of me as I’m the second person he knows who has met Boris Johnson on his Melbourne trip. The week before, the infamous London Mayor – a former editor of The Spectator, the Australian edition of which Switzer himself edits – appeared at the Melbourne Writers Festival to deliver the opening keynote address.\nOstensibly meant to be a speech on Johnson’s ‘belief in the power of literature to transform, inspire and delight,’ it was instead a ranging, idiosyncratic, ever amusing narrative about London and Melbourne, littered with references to both high and popular culture – from Star Wars to the Bible, Homer to Banjo Patterson – but with a particular fixation throughout on the chocolate of his antipodean youth, the Pollywaffle.\nWhen Johnson was announced as a keynote for the festival, he was regarded largely as a controversial decision. Yet, irrespective of what one might think of his politics, his skilled oration at the level of form – his own charming version of pollywaffle – marked a stark contrast to what we have been subjected to in the depths of our domestic election campaign.\n“He’s such a refreshing change from most politicians these days isn’t he?” Switzer comments.\nThe Liberal Party’s campaign launch had occurred a few days before, and though Switzer is critical of the use of speechwriting by both sides, he is particularly frustrated with Abbott’s address. “That was not him, I could just tell, it was a laundry list of policies that some second-rate speechwriter has just complied. It lacked the philosophical heft that Abbott is capable of producing,” he says.\nSwitzer certainly understands the difficulties and frustrations surrounding speechwriting. He’s known for his journalistic work, as opinion editor of The Australian newspaper until 2008, an editorial writer at The Australian Financial Review, and an assistant editor at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC. In 2008 he worked as senior adviser to then federal Liberal leader Brendan Nelson until the leadership vote that saw Malcolm Turnbull take over.\nIn his time as advisor, Switzer wrote several speeches for Nelson, yet controversy arose when an edited collection of speeches from Liberal figures was published, Peter van Onselen’s Liberals And Power. Switzer, it was revealed, had substantially authored the chapter under Nelson’s name, yet had recycled parts of the essay without attribution in several of his own pieces for The Spectator.\nI ask Switzer whether he believes Australians are genuinely shocked, and if he feels there is perhaps a suspicion in Australia of politicians’ use of speechwriters? “Well I think if you read some of [Robert] Menzies’ letters and articles he wrote after he retired from office in 1966, he was scornful of speechwriters, but of course he was from a different era when the demands – [such as] daily radio, television, cable, internet, all these interviews – were different. The pace of politics has changed dramatically. It’s so relentless now and politicians don’t have the time or inclination to write their own speeches.” Switzer believes there are rare exceptions, including Mark Latham and Tony Abbott.\nWe discuss Abbott – a Rhodes scholar, author of political manifesto Battlelines – a man obviously capable of writing in a more powerful way, yet who has been incredibly effective with three word slogans. I ask Switzer whether he thinks the change in the media landscape is making political oratory obsolete, that politicians know media outlets will only pick out a 30-second grab and therefore feel there’s no point crafting a long speech?\nIn the Spectator piece, Switzer notes that Howard and Costello were skilled off-the-cuff speakers, and in my own research for this series of interviews, attempts to find speechwriters on the LNP side had been difficult – a Google search for Howard’s speechwriter brings up mostly obituaries for his speechwriter Christopher Pearson, who was also a writer for Abbott. Many of the historically classic Australian political speechwriters such as Watson and Freud",
        "baseline": "enberg were from the ALP. I ask Switzer if he felt speechwriters were employed more frequently or effectively on the ALP side?\nSwitzer mentions Obama’s keynote addresses, which he describes as generally pretty uplifting, “He tries to put it in a broader framework, it isn’t just outlining policies. He’s a role model for Australian politicians and Boris is the same in England.” The examples of Obama and Boris Johnson, and their reception here seems to suggest that there’s obviously an appetite for oratory that uses narrative. I ask Switzer why he thinks we’re not seeing that in Australia, and if speechwriting is still important?\nSee Part I of the series, James Button on the death of the campaign speech.\nSee Part III of the series: Martin McKenzie-Murray on the culture of timidity in political speechwriting.\nAn edited version of this piece originally appeared as a Crikey News article.",

Entering the night two points out of a playoff spot, Washington played a defensive style that kept any goals from being scored for nearly 48 minutes.\nThe Bruins moved six points ahead of the Senators in the Northeast Division with five games left for both teams. That wouldn’t have been possible without the late rally, coming on goals from David Krejci and Ference.\nBoston played shorthanded much of the night. Already without defenseman Dennis Seidenberg – out with an infected cut on his leg – the Bruins lost defenseman Adam McQuaid in the first period. McQuaid went hard after a puck behind the net, and was hit from behind by Jason Chimera.\nChimera was given a game misconduct for charging and could receive further punishment from NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan. After being down for several minutes, McQuaid was helped off the ice by Greg Zanon and trainer Don DelNegro and went straight to the dressing room.\nJust before contact, McQuaid turned his shoulder parallel to the boards, which made him more vulnerable to a big hit.\nMcQuaid did not return, and Julien said he had a cut over the eyebrow and wasn’t feeling right, which led team doctors to prevent him from returning.\nIt was unclear if he’ll be able to play tomorrow against the Islanders.\nFormer Bruin Dennis Wideman gave the Capitals the lead",

After limiting the Capitals to weak shots all night, the Bruins had allowed a pair of goals in two minutes on Grade A scoring chances.\nBut the Bruins rallied late, Krejci tipping in a Chara shot with 3:10 left, then Ference shooting one off a Washington defenseman to tie it with 1:16 to go.\nBut the shootout, where the Bruins are 8-3 this season, wasn’t theirs. Alexander Semin scored to send it to a fourth round, and after Rich Peverley was stopped on a forehand by Michal Neuvirth, Brooks Laich won it with a shot to the top right-hand corner.",

According to release from Attorney General Maura Healey's Office, David C. Rogers is alleged to have driven a track-driven loader down a narrow foot path to the beach on Stage Harbor at low tide. A consent judgment requires that Rogers pay a $140,000 civil penalty for allegedly violating the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, the Public Waterfront Act and the Clean Waters Act.\nThe complaint filed Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court with the consent judgment, alleges that Rogers used the track loader to dig up 2,000 square feet of salt marsh on the shore. The digging, which damaged coastal resources, also damaged areas on three adjacent lots. In the complaint, the AG's Office alleged that Rogers abandoned the 9,000 pound track loader when it became stuck in the mud. \"The property owner had received three separate approvals for work on this property and knew the requirements needed to protect the natural resources there,\" said MassDEP Commissioner Martin Suuberg. \"Despite that knowledge, he still used equipment that badly damaged the salt marsh, tidal flats and shellfish that inhabited the area.\"\nRogers had obtained permits from the Town of Chatham to demolish a large home on his 2.47-acre Sears Point Road property and replace it with a new home, a boathouse and a swimming pool, the release said. Rogers purchased the property at 36 Sears Point Road in 2011 for $6,000,000, according to Chatham Assessors records. In 2014, the property was valued at $4,066,900, according to the records.\nIn addition to the damage done to the tidal flats, the partially submerged",

Testing later showed there was no contamination.\nIn addition to the $140,000 civil penalty, the settlement requires Rogers to fund a yet-to-be-identified $39,000 coastal wetlands project in Chatham. \"The Town is very pleased that the matter has been settled and looks forward to the restoration of the coastal environment,\" said Chatham Town Manager Jill Goldsmith.\nAs reportedly outlined in the settlement, Rogers will pay up to $220,000 to restore the salt marsh, dune and coastal bank areas he damaged, the release said. If the restoration is completed to the satisfaction of MassDEP, the Commonwealth will knock $50,000 off the $140,000 penalty, the AG's Office said.\n\"Our shared coastal areas provide important environmental resources and must be safeguarded,\" Attorney General Maura Healey said.",

        "prompt": "In Avengers: Infinity War, the titular superhero team will assemble in greater numbers than ever before, but where is everyone before the movie begins? Whereas Phase 1 of the MCU was focused on bringing Earth's Mightiest Heroes together, Phases 2 and 3 have divided and separated everyone across great distances, both physical and ideological, while also adding scores of new Marvel characters into the mix.\nOf course, all roads will lead to confronting Thanos on Earth in Avengers 3. With the biggest Marvel movie ever just a couple of weeks away, many fans won't have time to rewatch all 18 MCU films at this point, and even then keeping track of the dozens of characters is a hard task. In order to keep score of what each major participant officially confirmed to be in Infinity War is up to before the film begins, here's an easy guide.\nNote that the info below includes story points from Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War Prelude comics, which fills in some of the gaps of what happened to many of the heroes after the events of Captain America: Civil War. The comics' plot points may be generally accurate but also may not reflect the exact details as Infinity War will present them.\nThis Page: Where Are The Avengers?Page 2: Where Are The Guardians Of The Galaxy And The Rest Of The MCU?\nCaptain America is a changed man in many ways. Steve Rogers surrendered his shield and became a fugitive as result of Captain America: Civil War (indeed, according to Spider-Man: Homecoming, it's a common belief among the citizens of the MCU that Steve Rogers is now a \"war criminal\"). In the post-credits scene of Civil War, we saw Steve drop Bucky Barnes off in Wakanda. He has since gone off the grid; in the months since the Avengers broke apart, he's formed an international strike team and continued seeking justice while avoiding the authorities. Infinity War Prelude shows the core unit of Team Cap taking on a terrorist group armed with Chitauri weapons in Syria.\nBlack Widow is with Steve Rogers, her closest ally. Natasha was originally in favor of all of the Avengers signing the Sokovia Accords but she turned on Team Iron Man after the airport battle in Berlin. She disappeared but reunited with Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson at some point after Rogers freed his fellow captured Team Cap members from The Raft. Privately, Natasha continues to nurse the pain of Bruce Banner turning his back on their romance in Age of Ultron, setting up their reunion in Avengers 3.\nFalcon is with Rogers and Romanoff. Sam Wilson remains loyal to Steve, his best friend, especially after Rogers liberated him from The Raft. Sam's loyalty and heroism will meet their greatest test against Thanos.\nBucky is in Wakanda, where he was placed in cryo-stasis so that Shuri could engineer a way to heal the former Winter Soldier's mind from decades of Russian/Hydra brainwashing. In the end-credits scene of Black Panther, we see Bucky is awake and apparently cured. All that's missing is for the man the Wakandans now call the \"White Wolf\" to receive a new Vibranium left arm.\nOther members are following their own lives. Scarlet Witch is in hiding after she was freed from The Raft. Infinity War Prelude reveals that she has continued to pursue a romantic relationship with Vision. Hawkeye is retired (again) and has been allowed to return to his family on their farm after his stint as a prisoner in The Raft. He may, however, be under a form of house arrest. Ant-Man is back in San Francisco and also under house arrest after being freed from The Raft. We'll learn much more about Scott Lang's status in Ant-Man and the Wasp, which is set before the events of Infinity War.\nIron Man has continued to be the public face of the Avengers and began mentoring Peter Parker, the Amazing Spider-Man. He also publicly announced his engagement to Pepper Potts after Parker turned down Avengers membership in Homecoming. Stark seems to have had trouble finding new heroes to fill the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, however; Prelude showed him alone and fearing some great threat.\nWar Machine is regaining the use of his legs after he was injured during Civil War. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes remains loyal to his best friend Tony Stark and",
        "baseline": " will once again don his armor in Infinity War.\nRelated: Which Of The Original Avengers Will Die In Infinity War?\nVision has left the Avengers to join Wanda Maximoff in hiding according to Infinity War Prelude, with his powers (derived from the Mind Stone, which will make him a target of Thanos in Infinity War) giving him the ability to appear human. The last time Vision was mentioned in the MCU movies was in Homecoming when Stark noted Peter Parker would have a room in Avengers Compound next to the android had Spider-Man joined.\nSpider-Man is staying local in Queens, New York as a friendly neighborhood web-slinger, although will soon go cosmic and don the new Iron Spider armor. In the meantime, his Aunt May discovered Peter's secret identity at the end of Homecoming. Hopefully, Infinity War will address the fallout of that shocking moment.\nPage 2 of 2: Where Are The Guardians Of The Galaxy And The Rest Of The MCU?",

Make sure they consistently follow all procedures for verifying the card and cardholder information. They should also look for signs of stolen or bogus cards, such as old expiration dates and the absence of magnetic stripes, card verification value security codes, and holograms. Each card should be signed on the back, and that signature should match the one on the customer's receipt. Also, don't assume someone you know or recognize isn't a potential thief.

Apologize, but remember that such checks are designed to protect honest customers as well as businesses.\nSpeaking of your employees. Properly screen all prospective employees who'll be handling credit cards, cash, and high-value merchandise, as well as those with access to financial and accounting data. Background checks are an option, but they can be expensive. At the very least, ask for references from previous employers and contact them to get as accurate a picture as possible of your prospective hires.\nProtect IT infrastructure.

        "prompt": "It’s not what you do it’s the way that you do it. That is former Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez’s verdict on Pep Guardiola’s first Premier League title success.\nOthers have guided Manchester City to the title in recent years but not with the style and swagger we have seen in this campaign.\nGuardiola has now won seven league titles in three different countries and Xavi was his captain for his three triumphs in Spain.\nThe 38-year-old — who is in Madrid this week for a special course that fast-tracks ex-pros through their Fifa coaching badges — tells Sportsmail: ‘Everyone remembers the trophies and that’s what goes on your c.v. as a player, but more than just winning things, my memories from that era are of how much I enjoyed it.\n‘How much I enjoyed training every day. The team-talks. The analysis of the opposition. The way he broke down how we had to play each game, where we would find the space on the pitch, which of our players was going to end up being spare for us.\n‘You are always left with two things in football: what you have achieved and the way you have achieved it. People almost remember the way you have done things more than just what you have done.\n‘And if you ask the City players if they enjoy playing football then they would all say yes. Before maybe they were touching the ball 30 times in a game and now it’s 60. The defenders are on the ball more, the strikers are more involved in the play. Players enjoy playing for him and it shows.\n‘Guardiola’s teams enjoy playing because they have the ball and they are watching the other team running after it.\nAnd while Guardiola might not have conquered Europe this season, imposing his style of football in England goes down as one of his greatest triumphs, says his former player.\n‘It’s a huge achievement for him. There is so much competition in England. There are so many teams that can win the league.\n‘I did an interview a year ago when they were criticising him a lot. And I said then that he just needed time. If they were patient with him then he would end up succeeding.\nFinding the time and space on the pitch for his best players is the key to Guardiola’s success, says Xavi. ‘When you see him making the big arm gestures from his technical area, a lot of the time he’s reminding us where the space is.\nHe recalls a famous 6-2 win for Barcelona over Real Madrid in 2009 to make his point.\n‘That is when he put Lionel Messi as the false nine. He knew that the Madrid centre backs would not come out and press Messi when he dropped off so that would mean Messi, myself and Andres Iniesta would make a two-against-three against their centre midfield.\nEvidently, winning half the battle is not always enough. City could not find the space or the elusive extra man when they were suffocated by Liverpool at Anfield in the decisive first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\nAnd the fun factor of having players enjoying being on the ball instead of chasing it did not prevent Guardiola from falling short in the league last season.\nBut Xavi believes the high priest of passing is not as inflexible and dogmatic as he is sometimes portrayed. ‘In the Premier League, at least, he learned the “Leicester lesson” from when they won the title. He has adapted to the physical side of the game,’ says Xavi. ‘English football can be very direct — it’s often about second balls.\n‘Leicester, for example, played it very quickly up to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. How do you deal with that? In the first season City lost games, despite having 70 per cent possession, because they were beaten by counter-attacks.\n‘I remember the 4-2 defeat by Leicester and it felt like two long passes forward, two crosses, two shots and two goals. And you have to adapt to that so you stop conceding those types of goals. It’s about the confidence you give the players too. Nicolas Otamendi for example, played at Valencia, and he never had to come out from the back with the ball but Pep makes his defenders play out.\n‘In the end the defender learns and gets the confidence to play that way. It happened with Eric Abidal and with Carles Puyol at Barcelona — players who didn’t have quite the same natural ability as others in the team but they became incredible defenders.\nThey should also be prepared never to retreat. ‘It’s what Johan Cruyff taught him,’ says Xavi. ‘The best way to defend is to have the ball. As a fan, when am I not nervous watching my team? When I see that my team has got the ball and we are playing in the other team’s half.\nSo while on the one hand Guardiola has made concessions, on the other hand there are things that cannot be compromised. The Champions League quarter-finals put paid to City and to Xavi’s old club Barcelona but he still believes that possession is what counts.\nXavi does little to hide the fact that he wishes he was still out on the pitch, putting all Guardiola’s instructions into action.\nIn four years we could even see him coaching Qatar at the World Cup. ‘I’m definitely going to help them in some way. I don’t know if that will be as an advisor, a coach or an assistant",
        "baseline": ".\nHe’s convinced the World Cup in 2022 will be a success and assures me that the Qatar winter temperatures will mean some stadiums don’t even have to turn on the state-of-the-art air conditioning.\nThose two, along with Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, have been left in Guardiola’s slip-stream in the Premier League this season — blown away, along with all the doubts over whether he could create something special in England.\n‘The doubts were there when he started at Barcelona,’ Xavi says. ‘I remember we started his first season with a defeat and a draw. But even in those early games I would say to my close friends and family, “If you could only see the way we are training — we are going to win trophies”.\nIf City’s players finish the season breaking the points and goals record as they lift the title, they will feel much the same way.",

        "prompt": "Maryland Natural Resources Police, after receiving an autopsy report on the death of publisher and former diplomat Philip Merrill, have concluded that Merrill tied an 8-pound anchor to his leg and shot himself in the head while sailing on the Chesapeake Bay on June 10.\nFour days after declining to speculate on Merrill's cause of death when his body was found off Maryland's Eastern Shore, the police issued a two-page news release confirming the family's statement Tuesday that Merrill had taken his own life.\n\"It has been determined that Merrill died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,\" the police statement said.\nPolice also confirmed that blood had been found near the stern of Merrill's 41-foot yacht Merrilly and that he had purchased a shotgun within a week of his disappearance.\nCol. Mark S. Chaney, superintendent of the Natural Resources Police, and agency spokesman Sgt. Ken Turner did not return phone calls yesterday afternoon.\nChaney did not mention Merrill's gunshot wound at a news conference to discuss the body's discovery, and he maintained the agency's position that foul play wasn't involved.\nA Merrill family spokesman, Tom Marquardt, expressed hope that release of the report would allow the family to move on.\n\"The family is really looking forward to closure at this point,\" said Marquardt, the executive editor of The Capital newspaper of Annapolis, which Merrill owned.\nPieces of the investigation had been leaked to news organizations over the past week, and much of what was in the police news release had already been reported.\n\"The family understands the nature of the news business,\" Marquardt said. \"They were hoping for one report, rather than having it stretched over several days.\"\nThe search for Merrill, 72, began June 10 after several people noticed the yacht adrift near Plum Point in Calvert County.\nAndrew J. Carta, one of the first people to board the boat, said yesterday that the yacht's boom was secured when he found the boat about 7:30 p.m. When boats are under sail, the boom is typically free to move back and forth. Initially, many had speculated that Merrill had been struck in the head by the boom and knocked overboard, something not possible with the boom secured.\nCarta said he also saw \"drops [of blood] here and there spread out in the back of the boat.\" The blood was dry, he said.\nCarta said he took down the jib, anchored the boat, and tried to lower the mainsail while another person called for help.\nA Natural Resources Police officer boarded Merrilly at 8:15 p.m. and found Merrill's wallet with \"a large amount of currency\" and his cell phone, according to the police statement.\nThirty-five minutes later, a police investigator went to Merrill's home and learned that he had set off earlier that day and had not returned when expected.\nPolice also learned that Merrill purchased a Mossberg Model 500 12-gauge pump-action shotgun within a week of his disappearance, according to the police news release. Police said they searched Merrill's home and boat and have not found the weapon. Police have not said whether Merrill left a note.\nIn Tuesday's statement, the family said that Merrill had undergone heart surgery about a year ago and that in recent weeks his \"spirit had dimmed.\"\nSources close to the investigation said Merrill bought the gun at an Annapolis-area store.\nMeanwhile the Natural Resources Police led an intensive recovery effort that lasted nine days and involved numerous agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, local fire departments",
        "baseline": ", and volunteers.\nMerrill's body was found Monday, and police said yesterday that an 8-pound mushroom anchor was tied to Merrill's lower left leg. A boater found the body floating a mile off Poplar Island, nine miles north of where the boat was spotted.\nSmall mushroom anchors are typically used to secure dinghies and small rowboats, and wouldn't have enough heft to be useful in preventing a boat the size of the Merrilly from drifting.\nThe state's medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the head, according to Shirl Walker, a spokeswoman for the office. The shotgun was pressed directly to the head, Walker said.\nThe family, in its statement, asked that Merrill be remembered \"for the first amazing 71 years of his life.\"\nTo read the full text of the Department of Natural Resources statement on the Merrill investigation, go to www.baltimoresun.com/merrill.",

        "prompt": "Humanity�s home planet hardly merits the name-check in �After Earth,� M. Night Shyamalan�s sci-fi survival tale whose shipwreck action could (with the exception of a scene where our hero scrawls a crude map over Lascaux-like cave paintings) take place on any old life-supporting globe in the cosmos. The disappointingly generic film, which strands a father and son (Will and Jaden Smith) on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation, will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of �Oblivion,� not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening. Will Smith�s presence, not just as co-star but as originator of the story, seems likely to carry box office receipts beyond the benchmark of Shyamalan�s previous picture, the wretched �The Last Airbender,� but those hoping for a franchise should navigate elsewhere.\nPlans for such a franchise seem to be afoot, with filmmakers reportedly having written �1,000 years of back story� for these two characters and their society. They must be saving an awful lot for comic-book and videogame spinoffs, though, as the film squeezes its millennium-long setup into a few short moments of voiceover introduction.\nWe learn that, having ruined our environment, humans decamped en masse to Nova Prime, which would have been a nice place if not for the monsters that had been bred to kill humans. (By whom? Buy the comic book, kid.) Those beasts, Ursa, are blind, but can smell the pheromones humans release when afraid. When a member of the United Ranger Corps, the elder Smith�s Cypher Raige, found himself able to suppress his fear, he was suddenly invisible to the monsters. Harnessing this �ghosting� technique, he became a hero in the still-raging war.\nWhat we don�t learn in the too-quick intro is how all humankind came to speak in the same accent, most reminiscent perhaps of New Zealand�s � one that suits none of the cast very well, and makes Jaden Smith�s voiceover hard to follow. The script also fails to explain why future warriors, whose technology allows for a �cutlass� whose two ends morph into any type of blade the user requires, choose not to use guns or lasers against the mighty Ursa. One assumes it�s because somebody saw Darth Maul and thought his double-trouble light saber looked cool.\nIn any event, Cypher Raige comes home between long campaigns to find his son Kitai unsettled, struggling to live up to his legacy. He decides to take the boy along on an interstellar voyage, but the ship is thrown off course by a gravitational storm and must land on the nearest planet. A crash landing on Earth leaves three survivors: the Raiges and the Ursa specimen they�d been transporting for use in training aspiring ghost-ers. With both legs badly broken, Cypher must coach Kitai via cameraphone as he makes a 100-kilometer trek, dodging the freed Ursa and Earth�s own predators, to find the chunk of wreckage that can save their lives.\nThis is the first Shyamalan-directed film on which he�s not the sole screenwriter, and in fact it takes a while to discern any trace of the filmmaker�s personality in a screenplay credited to him and �Book of Eli� scribe Gary Whitta. The script hits its action beats competently as Kitai copes with marauding animals and dwindling supplies, and works best when the teen is in motion. But Shyamalan is of little help to the actor when Kitai faces internal challenges: Smith�s performance, all furrowed brow and worried eyes, gives us no reason to believe Kitai is made of the same tough stuff as his father.\nShyamalan would have to try hard to make another film as bad as �Airbender�; �After Earth�s� missteps in conception and execution are more akin to the head-scratching choices that kept �The Happening� from fulfilling its doomsday-flick potential. Who let that herd of",

On a planet that now freezes every night, how do the flora of tropical rainforests survive? What seasoned soldier would send his son on a deadly four-day mission with a backpack the size of a bicycle seat?\nThe film�s resolution, predictable to any viewer, feels oddly impersonal for a father/son bonding tale both dreamed up and enacted by a father for the son following in his footsteps. Whatever the faults of 2006�s �The Pursuit of Happyness,� that film employed the bond between the two Smiths much more effectively. One wonders if it might be wise to wait a while before the next pairing � letting Jaden Smith, like Kitai Raige, come into his own before asking him to share a screen meaningfully with one of Hollywood�s biggest personalities.",

Check back tomorrow for the next installment.\nJon Alpert and Matthew O'Neill's Redemption closes with a shot of a poor woman dragging her shopping cart, freighted with bulging plastic bags of cans and bottles, down Wall Street. It's not exactly subtle, though I'm hard-pressed to imagine another ending for a documentary whose very subject is the grinding endlessness of poverty. Alpert and O'Neill trail various canners, New Yorkers who collect cans and bottles and redeem them at grocery stores or recycling centers for five cents apiece, and the portraits they collect show how tough life can be when you have to dig every nickel out of a Dumpster.\nThere's Walter, a grizzled old Vietnam vet who's been canning for eight or ten years and explains, \"This is a full-time job.\" There's Susan in Manhattan, a former white-collar worker at Microsoft who can't make ends meet on her Social Security check and has to protect herself against a bullying Chinese woman who steals her cans. There's Hassan and Lily, an Egyptian man and a Chinese woman in Chinatown who've grown close out of necessity more than love. And there's Nuve, a Hispanic mother of three in Sunnyside, Queens, who packs her two older ones off to school and takes the youngest along as she scours the alleys. \"It's honorable work no matter what people say,\" she protests, though the days are so long she's prone to tears.\nInterviewed for the website Gold Derby, Alpert and O'Neill reported that getting canners to open up to them took a while. \"Most New Yorkers walking down the street will not make eye",
        "baseline": " contact with men and women collecting bottles and cans,\" said O'Neill. \"They pretend that they're not there; they walk right by them. I think that after being ignored like that for so long, many people were surprised that we were asking them about their lives.\"\nThe filmmakers don't often get inside the canners' homes—some of them don't have homes—but when they do, the movie is sobering. Lily works all night collecting cans and returns to a one-bedroom apartment she shares with six other people; sitting in the kitchen, she lowers her voice to speak to the camera, and you can feel the terrible constriction of living in such close quarters, the awful dead-of-night weariness. Redemption gives you a chance to meet people who've fallen over the edge into poverty, and realize how easily any middle-class person might follow them. As a title at the beginning of the movie advises us, canning is a growth industry in America.",

I have always loathed the Dead, with their bloated songs and sense of counter-cultural entitlement. There are so many superior bands to take heroin to.\nNonetheless, the Dead remain a deep loam in American culture, a sine qua non ranging from internet protocols (Deadheads populated Stanford’s AI lab in the 1970s) to modern psychedelicists like Animal Collective. Deadheads not only invented Apple (old news), but also Saturday Night Live; Keith Haring was a teenage Deadhead.\nIf ever there were reason to reassess the spectre of the Dead, it’s Day of the Dead – a sprawling (of course) 59-track, five-CD covers compilation. Here, a plethora of artists tackle Dead tunes in a variety of revelatory idioms. The cat-herding comes courtesy of arch-networkers Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the National, who previously curated 2009’s Dark Was The Night outing – once again, in aid of the Red Hot HIV/Aids charity.\nThe headline news is that little here sounds like the Dead – allowing sceptics a way in, and the work to breathe anew. If you like War On Drugs, you might warm to Touch of Grey, done in the vein of Bob Dylan singing Tom Petty circa 1985.\nAustralian Courtney Barnett sashays quite typically through New Speedway Boogie, while the inimitable Bill Callahan makes Easy Wind into a spacey dirge (this is praise). The album provides a timely snapshot of leftfield Americana with very welcome esoteric additions. This roster says more, perhaps, about the artists involved than it does about the Dead’s perceived legacy: these leftfielders are often the heirs to the alternative rock tradition that historically has had little time for the jam band.

What this team needs at the moment is a coach who can tell you how it is and how to fix it. We believe we will turn it around because we have him at the head of everything.\"\nExtra points: Safety Ibraheim Campbell said the \"chances are pretty high\" he'll be able to play Saturday after missing the last four games because of a hamstring injury. … Defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo has not registered a sack since Sept. 27 at Penn State. \"He has to get back to cutting loose (when) rushing the passer,\" Fitzgerald said. \"He is way, way overthinking that aspect of his game right now.\"",

        "prompt": "Decorative tiles can transform your overworked, underappreciated kitchen backsplash wall into the center of attention, and applying them is a straightforward DIY task to boot.\nThe kitchen is the hardest-working room in the house, with cabinets, counters, and appliances filling nearly every square inch. Yet one of its most visible, functional surfaces, the backsplash wall, typically garners no more attention than a tub of tofu at a Texas barbecue.\nBacksplash tile is an easy project you can do in a long weekend; new material options like smart tile make it even quicker and more simple. Here's how to use tile to transform this blank wall into an eye-catching focal point.\nVisit any home center or tile showroom and you'll find wall tiles in dozens of colors, styles, and patterns. The most popular choices for a backsplash include glazed-ceramic tile and glass tile. Both have nonporous surfaces that are impervious to staining and easy to clean. Natural stone tile, especially tumbled marble, is also popular for backsplashes, but before grouting you must seal the marble's porous surface to increase its stain resistance.\nMany backsplash tiles are now available on pre-spaced sheets (roughly 10 inches square), which makes them much easier to use. A newer trend, especially for kitchen backsplashes, is so-called \"smart\" or peel-and-stick tile, which combines pre-spaced tile sheets with a self-adhesive backing mat.\nThe benefits of peel-and-stick tile are speed and simplicity. You don't need to spread a messy adhesive, you don't need to use tile spacers, and you can begin grouting immediately after the tile is placed.\nThe downsides: you're limited to the styles on hand, and you have to take care when setting the tile, because the adhesive is so sticky it makes it hard to re-set any misaligned sheets. (And you'll notice misalignments more because the entire sheet is affected.) Also, these tile sheets cost more per square foot than conventional tile.\nTile is often installed with thinset mortar. But for a backsplash wall, consider using tile mastic. It costs a bit more than conventional thinset, but it doesn't require mixing and it can be applied right from the can. In addition, mastic holds faster than thinset mortar, so there's less chance of the tile sliding down the wall while you're working.\nDon't use mastic with glass tiles; the impermeable tiles prevent the moisture in the mastic from evaporating, and the adhesive may discolor over time and be visible through the tile. The other drawback of mastic is that, because it sets up so quick, you may not be able to re-set misaligned tiles.\nThere are pre-mixed thinset mortars available that work well with glass and other tile materials. Be aware that thinsets take longer to dry, so take special care to use spacers for every tile to keep them from settling or shifting before the thinset dries.\nStep 1: sand the backsplash wall with 80-grit sandpaper; both thinset and tile mastic will adhere better to a roughened surface. Wipe away the sanding dust with a damp cloth.\nStep 2: apply the mastic or thinset to the wall with a notched trowel. The ridges created by the notched trowel will dramatically increase the adhesive's bond strength. Spread only enough for a few square feet of tile at a time (less if using small individual tiles). If you're using mastic and you notice that a skin forms on the surface, scrape the wall clean and apply a fresh coat—the skin means the mastic has started to dry and won't bond properly to the tile.\nStep 3: set the first course of tiles along the countertop at the bottom of the backsplash wall. Firmly press each tile into the mastic or thinset. Use plastic spacers to maintain uniform grout joints. The size of the spacers varies depending upon the size of the tile, but for backsplash tiles, you'll probably find yourself using 1/8- or 3/16-inch spacers.\nReminder: You'll need to cut and notch tiles to fit around electrical outlets, at corners, and anywhere a whole piece of tile won't fit. The best tool for that is a wet saw, which you can rent for about $50 a day. Make sure it has the proper blade for the tile material you chose; glass tile requires a specific glass diamond blade. Once all the tiles are installed, allow the mastic to cure at least overnight. Thinset mortars may take longer to fully dry; check the manufacturer's specifications. Remove tile spacers once the site has completely cured.\nStep 4: fill the joints between the tile with grout. Use sanded grout to fill any tile joints that are 1/8 inch or wider, and use an unsanded grout for narrower joints. For glass tiles, space them tightly and use unsanded or epoxy grout that won't scratch the tile surface. Mix the grout with water to the consistency of thick yogurt and apply it to the tile with a rubber grout float.\nSmear the grout diagonally across the tiles, forcing it deep into the joints and then wiping the excess from the surface. After grouting, clean the backsplash with a wet sponge, which helps press the grout fully into the joint and sets clean lines between tiles. Be careful not to pull any of the grout from the joints. Wait 30 minutes or so for the grout to set and for a hazy film to appear on the tile surface. Then buff the tiles clean with a dry cloth. Allow the grout to cure for at least two days, then seal the grout joints with silicone sealer if necessary.\n",
        "baseline": "Step 5: caulk the edges. Any joint or edge where the tile meets another surface like the countertop should be caulked, not grouted. Use a silicone caulk designed for kitchens and bathrooms, in a color that coordinates with your design. Cut the tube tip at an angle and squeeze a uniform bead of caulk into the joint. Make sure to move the tube at a constant rate to ensure consistent coverage. Then, go over the joint with a round-edged caulking tool to create a smooth, evenly radiused seal. Wipe excess on a rag or paper towel.\nStep 6: respace electrical outlets. With the added thickness of the new tile, your outlets will likely no longer be flush to the front of the backsplash. Respace them with outlet spacers, small plastic pieces that slip between the outlet and wall box. You may need slightly longer screws. Be sure to turn off power to the circuit at the main electrical box before working with outlets.",

        "prompt": "An informational meeting for parents is scheduled this week following the suicides of three Farragut High School students this semester.\nThree Farragut High School students have committed suicide this semester, including two within the past month, prompting Knox County Schools officials to schedule a meeting Thursday for parents to air their concerns and discuss a plan for moving forward.\nDozens of students gathered in the school's parking lot Monday night in remembrance of the latest victim, a senior who, according to a Knox County Sheriff's Office incident report, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his truck Friday night near Anchor Park in West Knox County.\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee has chosen not to identify the victims.\nThe death followed the suicide of a Farragut High School sophomore less than three weeks earlier. Another Farragut sophomore took his own life in January.\nAn online petition created after the second student's death is asking for an open and ongoing discussion of the issue with students, as well as an apology from school administrators for not addressing the situation earlier.\nThe change.org petition, authored by Farragut High School junior Catherine Miller, had garnered more than 2,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\nAfter the first student's death in January, \"(O)ur school swept it under the rug,\" Miller writes. \"Administration did not discuss it with anyone. Teachers proceeded with class the next day as if nothing ever happened. I am hesitant to believe if the situation, of even the topic of suicide and mental illness, was properly discussed we would not have to mourn two of our peers. Especially in one semester.\"\nThe Knox County Board of Education's policy states, in part, that following a student death by suicide, students, faculty and staff should be informed and grief counselors should be made available at the school.\nMiller said when she initially approached school officials in the wake of the second death last month, she was told that school protocol dictated that no student assembly or official acknowledgement could be made for three months. She said counselors, however, were at the school following the second suicide.\n\"The students and the parents just didn't know, we didn't know,\" she said. \"When I made this petition ... we wanted answers and we wanted justice.\"\nSchool board member Susan Horn, whose 5th district includes Farragut, said there was much more going on among school officials behind the scenes than what was shared with students or parents.\n\"I've heard from several parents that feel the administration is doing a very good job. I've probably heard from more parents who think they're doing a good job.\"\nGrief counselors are at the school this week, Knox County Schools spokeswoman Carly Harrington confirmed. Statewide standardized testing also was postponed at both Farragut High and Farragut Middle schools, she said.\nA letter from Farragut High School Principal Ryan Siebe was emailed to parents Sunday, inviting them to an informational meeting Thursday night to share concerns and \"hear our plans for future trainings on suicide for staff, students and families.\"\nA representative of the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network also will be on hand to offer advice on how to proceed, the letter states.\n\"You may have heard but I wanted to let you know that we have lost another one of our precious students this weekend,\" Siebe's letter begins. \"Parents, please talk to your sons and daughters your own way tonight and know that we will have counselors available all week to help them with this terrible loss at school.\"\nAdditionally, the letter says the senior awards, originally scheduled for Monday night, will be rescheduled to a later date. Advanced Placement exams will not be rescheduled, the letter notes, although support services will be made available to those students as well.\nSchool officials said Thursday's meeting will not be open to the media.\nA father of two Farragut High School students, who asked not to be identified because of concerns about his children's well-being, said the letter was the first communication to parents about the suicides from the school district.\nKnox County Schools Superintendent Bob Thomas said in a statement: \"Our hearts go out to the families, students, teachers, staff and community. The loss of life among any of our students weighs heavily on us all, but the loss of life as a result of suicide is devastating. It’s a public health issue that Knox County Schools takes very seriously. Our number one concern is for the students, and we have been working with experts to help guide us as we provide support to all impacted.\"\nIn a written statement provided to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee on Tuesday, Siebe states, \"We are deeply saddened by the recent tragedies at our school, and our support and condolences go out to the families. The welfare of our students is a concern of every member of our staff, and any loss is heartbreaking to the entire community. We have been working closely with local professionals with Tennessee Suicide Prevention",
        "baseline": " Network and the East Tennessee Mental Health Association to provide us with evidence-based best practices that we are following.\"\nMiller said she's encouraged by the steps now being taken.\n\"Changes are definitely happening,\" she said. \"They are doing so much now.\"\nAccording to the latest available figures, the number of suicide deaths among people ages 10-19 in Tennessee has increased each year since 2011, with 49 deaths reported in 2014.\nDespite the stigma of suicide, open discussion is always the best prevention, said Anne Young, who chairs the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network's statewide advisory council.\n\"It's a myth that you can put the thought or notion of suicide in someone's head,\" said Young, who praised school officials for calling this week's planned assembly. \"The reason to have a conversation about suicide is to get it on the table. Once it's on the table, there's hope that something can be done.\n\"There's real therapy in saying things out loud.\"",

        "prompt": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker waits backstage before speaking at the Freedom Summit, Jan. 24, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAs the governor of Wisconsin, Republican Scott Walker hasn’t had to deal much with foreign policy. That’s not his fault, of course – governors have plenty of important responsibilities, but foreign affairs aren’t among them – but now that Walker is poised to become a leading GOP presidential candidate, he’ll have to demonstrate some working understanding of the world.\nHe certainly seems eager to try. A Republican operative recently lobbed comically easy questions at Walker, such as, “You command the [Wisconsin] National Guard. I wondered if you might want to comment on how you feel about the threat posed by ISIS and other entities abroad?” Walker responded by delivering a lengthy, and probably rehearsed, answer about his extensive work on matters of national security, including classified briefings from FBI officials.\nOn ABC’s “This Week” yesterday, Martha Raddatz approached the same issue, but without the softballs.\nRADDATZ: Let’s talk about some specific, and you talk about leadership and you talk about big, bold, fresh ideas. What is your big, bold, fresh idea in Syria?\nWALKER: Well, I think – I go back to the red line.\nRADDATZ: Let’s not go back. Let’s go forward. What is your big, bold idea in Syria?\nWALKER: I think aggressively, we need to take the fight to ISIS and any other radical Islamic terrorist in and around the world, because it’s not a matter of when they attempt an attack on American soil, or not if I should say, it’s when, and we need leadership that says clearly, not only amongst the United States but amongst our allies, that we’re willing to take appropriate action. I think it should be surgical.\nAt this point, it apparently occurred to Walker that meaningless sound bites and catchphrases weren’t going to cut it.\nEvery White House hopeful goes through a learning process, and Walker wouldn’t be the first governor who struggled with foreign policy as his campaign got underway. The bigger problem is that the Wisconsin Republican doesn’t have a strong suit to lean on when the international questions get",
        "baseline": " tough. His record in his home state probably won’t help.\nOne of his biggest applause lines [in Iowa last week] was his mention that Wisconsin requires photo identification before voting. That’s true, but Walker didn’t mention that the requirement has been blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court and may never be enforced.\nWalker boasted about the “big and bold” tax cuts on his watch – $2 billion in savings for individuals and businesses – without mentioning the projected $2.2 billion budget shortfall Wisconsin faces in the coming two years.\nThe governor would be in even more trouble if he tried to turn to his attention to job creation, which has arguably been Walker’s worst issue.\nI realize the Wisconsin Republican has quickly positioned himself as a top-tier competitor, generating considerable “buzz” and attention, but as a rule, candidates who struggle with foreign and domestic policy don’t do too well.",

When Markle wore a Stella McCartney cape dress for Queen Elizabeth II’s birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London last month, that label was suddenly a contender. But the subsequent choice of a bespoke Emilia Wickstead skirt suit for a commemoration service at Westminster Abbey a few days later proved equally tantalizing to royal watchers — especially because Wickstead created a universally admired wedding gown for the Duke of Wellington’s daughter, Charlotte Wellesley, two years ago.\nOther names being bandied about include Erdem, Burberry and Alexander McQueen; the last of those labels was responsible for the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress in 2011.\nMay. 18, 2018, 7:31 a.m.\nPrince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle at the royal wedding — stepping in after the father of the bride fell ill just days before the ceremony.\nMay. 18, 2018, 7:00 a.m.\nIt’s a simple and oft-overlooked accessory, but between Rihanna’s bishop’s mitre at the May 7 Met Gala in New York and the fascinator frenzy sparked by Saturday’s British royal wedding where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot amid a sea of stylish headgear, the hat is making a comeback.\nMay. 17, 2018, 4:25 p.m.\nRoyal weddings have long been occasions of fascination and splendor. Here’s a look at the marriages of key members of the British royal family beginning with Queen Victoria’s 1840 union with her first cousin Prince Albert.\nMay. 17, 2018, 10:45 a.m.\nQuaint and odd they may be, but the rules of the royal road are both clear and strict, and neither tabloids nor TV will change them. In the House of Windsor, princesses are born, not made – or married.\nIf the sheer volume of air time devoted to the run-up to the royal wedding is any indication, Americans apparently do want to immerse themselves in a ceremony full of arcane tradition for a royal sixth in line to the throne.\nBlame or thank a world gone mad. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is a fortuitously timed distraction from the disturbing deterioration of our own democracy, which appears to be crumbling like the British Empire we once fought to escape. But it's also a curious escape hatch given that the last few royal nuptials to elicit this much attention from American TV audiences were hardly idyllic or dreamy affairs.\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" blood-soaked \"Red Wedding\" is still at the top of that list, followed by King Joffrey's less bloody but still colorful demise. Then there's \"The Crown's\" near-loveless union between Queen Elizabeth II and Philip, \"Victoria's\" fraught marriage, the pairing that ripped apart a nation in \"The White Queen\" and the ill-fated string of mat",

His reporting failures included articles in prestigious publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet as well as in Cancer Discovery, a journal for which he serves as one of two editors in chief.\nDr. Baselga acknowledged that he had frequently failed to disclose industry connections, and said he planned to correct the record in 17 recent articles. But he disputed whether he should have disclosed his ties in dozens of other cases, saying that the articles involved early-stage research for which there was little financial implication for companies.\nSeveral institutions, including The New England Journal of Medicine and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, have said they are looking into his disclosures. The American Association for Cancer Research said it had also begun a review of Dr. Baselga’s reporting practices. Dr. Baselga appears to have violated disclosure rules while he was president of that organization in 2015 and 2016. The A.A.C.R. also publishes Cancer Discovery.\nIn the email, Dr. Thompson and Ms. Martin described the guidelines for reporting industry relationships as “nebulous,” adding that “we need to work with journal publishers and professional societies to standardize the reporting process.” They said they had been discussing the issue with ASCO, the cancer group, which has pushed for more standardized disclosure.\nA decade ago, a series of scandals relating to hidden payments by drug companies to prominent physicians prompted medical journals and professional societies to beef up their reporting requirements. But as Dr. Baselga’s case and others demonstrate, much is still left to the honor system. Medical journals have said they don’t routinely fact-check authors’ disclosures.\nIn comments to The Times and ProPublica, The New England Journal of Medicine acknowledged that the problem of failed disclosures is “widespread” and said it was putting in place a better system to track authors’ disclosures. Two of the articles that Dr. Baselga said he planned to correct were published in that journal.\nDr. Baselga has served since March on the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb, a major manufacturer of cancer drugs, and since 2017 on the board of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment to cancer centers, including to Memorial Sloan Kettering.\nDr. Baselga received nearly $3.5 million in payments from drug, medical equipment and diagnostic companies from August 2013 through 2017, according to Open Payments, a",

The bulk of that amount, about $3 million, involved a payment from Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, for Dr. Baselga’s ownership interest in a company it acquired, Seragon Pharmaceuticals, in 2014.\nBut that total amount does not include many companies with which Dr. Baselga has ties that do not report physician payments to the federal database because they are biotech start-ups without any products approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

        "prompt": "Alabama has begun routing wireless 911 calls over a statewide IP network in the first phase of its Next Generation Emergency Network (ANGEN).\nThe state's IP Next Generation 911 network will not be fully up and running until well beyond the original 18-month timetable, pointing up the need to set realistic goals in pioneering tech programs. Read more.\nWhen completed, ANGEN will be one of the first statewide IP 911 routing systems in the nation, cutting costs and improving reliability for traditional emergency voice calls, and laying the groundwork for the use of advanced text, video and data services. The first public safety answering point (PSAP) was put on the network Sept. 30, and by early November seven PSAPs were up and running, receiving wireless calls from T-Mobile, the first carrier connected to the network.\nOther national and regional wireless carriers are expected to join the network in the near term, but full operational capability for ANGEN with both mobile and traditional wireline calls at all 115 answering points in the state is probably three years off, said Jason Jackson, executive director of the state’s 911 board.\nThat will be several years beyond the initial — and ambitious —18-month timeline for the project. But Alabama still will be in select company with one of the first, if not the only, statewide system in the country, said Kevin Breault, vice president of emergency services products for Bandwidth, the project’s 911 services provider.\n“It’s a long process to overhaul and rebuild an existing 911 infrastructure,” Breault said. “The technology is the easy part.” Funding and coordinating the shift to new protocols among hundreds of PSAPs and the national, regional and local wired and wireless service providers is the real challenge.\nWhen it is completed, the legacy system of seven selective 911 voice routers from CenturyLink and AT&T will be collapsed into a single consolidated network, the Alabama Research and Education Network operated by the Alabama Supercomputer Authority. It will be served by redundant routers at supercomputer centers in Huntsville and Montgomery to provide resiliency.\nWhen a 911 call is made from a participating carrier it will be directed to one of the two points of presence in Huntsville or Montgomery. From there the call will be routed to the appropriate PSAP. The routing function is provided by Bandwidth. The appropriate PSAP is determined by location information that is forwarded by the carrier along with the call. This information also is forwarded to the PSAP and displayed on a console when the call is received.\nThe state has a history of leadership in 911 services, claiming the nation’s first 911 call in 1968 over a local system in the town of Haleyville just a month after AT&T announced designation of 911 as a national emergency number and two weeks before AT&T implemented its first 911 system in Indiana.\nMore than 40 years later, the state’s circuit-switched copper-wire system was struggling to keep up with telecom advances that included wireless mobile phones and Voice over IP. “We’ve put on Band-Aid after Band-Aid,” Jackson said.\nTo provide a comprehensive fix, Alabama applied for 911 improvement grants in 2009 under a $40 million program through the Transportation and Commerce departments. Cost was estimated at $460,000 for two routers and about $1.4 million to build out last-mile connections to each of the 115 answering points for a total cost of $1.9 million. The state received $950,000 in federal grants and committed another $950,000 of its own money, largely from a fund established originally to improve wireless 911 capabilities.\nWork on the system began in June 2012. Wireless traffic is being moved onto the new system in Phase 1 because it accounts for the majority of emergency calls in Alabama, as much as 70 percent in some places.\nPhase 2 of the ANGEN transition will begin in early 2014 by bringing in wireline calls, as well.\nThe first PSAP to tap into the IP network was Etowah County in northeastern Alabama on Sept. 30, followed by the city of Dothan in the southeast part of the state two days later. “Once the first two were done the learning curve was dramatically less, and we are turning them on much more quickly now,” Jackson said. The biggest achievement with the IP network to date is that the call takers can’t see any difference in the service. “Which is a win for us,” Jackson said.\nAs additional PSAPs, carriers and types of digital media are brought online, the system is expected to move beyond parity with the legacy. One of the first advantages will be the ability to transfer calls easily from one answering center to another. Presently, only those PSAPs that have mutual agreements can transfer calls if one center is unavailable or a call is misdirected. With the digital system, “we can transfer a call anywhere in the state with one click,” Jackson said.\nThe ultimate goal of Next Generation 911 is to combine voice, video, text and data on a single emergency communications platform, to let callers use the services they are accustomed to on their smart phones and other devices when making emergency calls, as well as provide additional information to first responders.\n“With the legacy tandem servers we couldn’t take in video or text messages,” Jackson said. Technically that would be possible with the new system, but “we don’t know how",
        "baseline": " to handle it.” He estimates it will be about three years before ANGEN is fully implemented, and incorporation of digital media in 911 services can become a reality.\nFull implementation of NG911 nationally will take even longer, Breault said. “It’s a good 10 years away,” although there will be pockets of functionality such as Alabama and smaller regions well before then.\nThe digital signaling and routing for 911 is not difficult, he said. “What we are doing now is what has already occurred in the commercial world.” But 911 services are lagging the commercial world by 10 to 15 years.\nThe biggest reason for the lag is that 911 systems are publicly funded. That means money often is tight; budgeting cycles make planning for large-scale projects difficult; and fragmented infrastructure, administration and budgeting complicate large-scale roll-out of new services. But as soon as the plans and budgets are ready, the technology will be available.",

But when he got Total's standard reply \"skirting round the issues\", Robertson decided to do something a little more dramatic. He climbed up the outside of the 324-metre Eiffel Tower without ropes.\nThe Wareham-based photojournalist is known in climbing circles around the world for his bold exploits, in particular climbing unroped on sea cliffs, a new form of the sport called deep-water soloing.\nIt was while researching a climbing trip to Burma that Robertson became aware of the scale of human rights abuses there and decided to forget his holiday and get involved. He had already planned a break in Paris when he got his letter from Total last week, and decided on the spur of the moment to step up his campaigning.\n\"I thought about climbing the Total building instead,\" Robertson said. \"The climbing looked all right but it's a bit tucked away up there in La Défense, whereas the Eiffel Tower is super-public.\"\nRobertson and a friend spent an hour on a park bench on Monday below the tower watching the movements of security forces and drawing a slogan on a T-shirt. \"I nipped into a public loo, put the T-shirt on and my rock-climbing shoes, and scampered up to this little pigeon ledge at 25ft.\"\nOnce established on the tower, Robertson climbed quickly to the first difficult section, a nearly two-metre (5ft) overhang at 90 metres.\nFacing the certainty that a fall would kill him, Robertson crossed the overhang, pulling himself up on a piece of aluminium riveted to the iron structure that he said creaked as it took his weight. \"I do so much soloing, though, and to be honest, that bit of aluminium was probably stronger than some of the rock I pull on. But it did flex.\"\nAbove the overhang, Robertson said, there was no going back. \"",
        "baseline": "After the overhang I got on to the suicide cages covering the first level. Except you're on the outside looking in. All I could see were loads and loads of people staring out. They were speechless. Quite a lot of them pointed their phones at me, but nobody said anything. Having said that, I was going really fast.\"\nAt the second level, Robertson ducked inside the iron and steel structure to avoid the authorities, but at about 220 metres he saw two firefighters and an Eiffel Tower employee waiting for him on a gantry above his head.\n\"I was surrounded. I'd done 240 metres, I thought, it might be better to come quietly.\" After being handcuffed by police and detained for questioning for three hours, Robertson was released without charge.\n\"I was expecting to go inside for a week or so,\" he said. \"If you do something like this for a cause you believe in, well, there's a price to pay for that.\"",
        "llm_baseline": "I was just thinking about the next move.I was just thinking about the next hold.I had to get to the top.I was thinking about the security guards.I was thinking about the police.I was thinking about the media.I was thinking about the people who were going to be watching me. \" He climbed to the top of the tower in 20 minutes,using the rivets and the iron work itself as handholds and anchors. \" I was climbing on the rivets,which are about 1cm in diameter,and the iron work itself is about 2cm in diameter.It<unk>s not like climbing on rock,it is a bit more forgiving. \" Robertson said he was not worried about the security guards. \" I was just concentrating on the climbing.I was just thinking about the next move.I was just thinking about the next hold.I had to get to the top. \" He reached the top of the tower in 20 minutes,and spent 10 minutes there before going down. \" I was just thinking about the next move.I was just thinking about the next move.I was just thinking about the next hold.I was just thinking about the next hold.I had to get to the top.I was thinking about the security guards.I was thinking about the police.I was thinking about the media.I was thinking about the people who were going to be watching me. \" Robertson said he was not worried about the security guards",
        "llm_senso_medium": "\" IfI ' d fallen off,my head would have been about 100 metres below me,andI really didn ' t want to fall off. \" Robertson said he was not scared,but took some time to negotiate the rest of the climb. \" I took a few deep breaths and thought it was time to get on with the climb and enjoy it rather than fear it. \" After about an hour and a half,Robertson reached the very top of the tower,and the security forces,who had been trying to rescue him from the ground,took him in an ambulance. \" I sat down for a while feeling a little bit better,and then I sat to rest. \" The campaign against Total ' s investment in Burma has been going on for more than a year,and the company has been put under sustained pressure from human rights groups to pull out of Burma. Last week,the French government told Total it would not be able to use its French-owned Coface trade credit insurance to support its investment in Burma.Robertson said he thought climbing the tower was a way",

        "prompt": "Coming off a needed palette-cleansing victory in the Carabao Cup, Tottenham Hotspur look to begin the business of closing the distance between themselves and leaders Manchester City on Saturday when they face struggling Wolverhampton at Molineux.\nTottenham Hotspur (7-0-3) had a pair of matches to forget, first being held to a 2-2 draw at PSV Eindhoven in Champions League play that all but scuttled their hopes for advancing to the knockout round despite having three matches remaining. The hangover continued Monday at Wembley Stadium, where the Lilywhites never fully recovered from a sixth-minute goal scored by Riyad Mahrez as they fell 1-0 to the reigning champions.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino's lineup deserved some scrutiny, most notably in the form of selecting Moussa Sissoko for the left wing in Spurs' 4-2-3-1 set-up when a creative tandem of Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela was there in the offering. It was Lamela, though, who was left to rue his scuffed chance during the final quarter-hour, the ball taking a slight skip on the worn Wembley pitch before he sent his shot for the upper left corner well over the bar.\nThe loss dropped Spurs five points behind City, but for all intents and purposes, it feels like 50 given the chasm in quality the Citizens enjoyed for a good portion of the match before Spurs desperately chased - and nearly caught - an equaliser late. While it would be easy to use playing at Wembley for a second straight season as an excuse since the re-opening of White Hart Lane has now been pushed back to January, defender Toby Alderweireld said his team cannot lament what has been.\n\"We never used Wembley as an excuse and we will not do that now,\" Alderweireld told Sky Sports. \"But it has affected us. I am grateful to play at Wembley, it is a very historical place, but it is not the same feeling as White Hart Lane. There we had a special home feeling.\n\"But in that way, we did very well to be successful at Wembley. But I know the club is doing everything in their power to play as quickly as possible in our stadium.\"\nThat is what made Wednesday's 3-1 victory at West Ham United to reach the Carabao Cup quarterfinals so vital to getting rid of the negative vibes. Heung-Min Son had a brace on either side of halftime for his first two goals of the season, and the relief was palpable for the South Korea international as he celebrated the goal with Pochettino.\n\"You feel sorry when a player works hard and does not get rewarded and Sonny has been ready to work more and more to change his situation,\" the gaffer told The Times. \"I never usually celebrate the goal but was a little worried for him.\"\nFernnado Llorente helped Spurs see out the match with a goal shortly after West Ham pulled within 2-1, and the spoils of the win included another London derby in the round of eight, this time against Arsenal and Pochettino's old friend and new Gunners manager Unai Emery.\nAs the preparations continue to eventually move back to White Hart Lane, Spurs did lock up an important piece of the side's nucleus to play there for years to come by extending Alli's contract through 2024. He joins striker Harry Kane and keeper Hugo Lloris as the only players with a wage packet of at least £100,000 per week, and it may also put to rest the rumours of Pochettino taking the Real Madrid job that opened up following the sacking of Julen Lopetegui.\n\"He's a massive part of wanting to be at this club,\" Alli said of Pochettino. \"The fans are amazing, the chairman, everyone, the whole club is amazing. But as players, you work with the gaffer, you want to have a good relationship with the manager and we all feel like we've got that here.\n\"We all love the way we work. The style of play, we all want to be a part of it. He's done a lot for me so far and hopefully he can keep helping me to improve.\"\nAfter an impressive start to the season in which they lost just one of their first eight matches, new boys Wolverhampton have come back down to earth some with back-to-back losses. The Wolves (4-3-3) continue to struggle offensively - their nine goals are the fewest of any club in the top half of the table - and have gone 214 minutes without a tally following their 1-0 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion last weekend.\n\"We've got a tough week ahead in training, improving on Brighton because we need to get back to winning ways,\" centre back and talisman Conor Coady told the Birmingham Mail. \"It's been an OK start for us, we've won a couple but we've been beat the last two games which isn't a nice feeling at all.\"\nCoach Nuno Espirito Santo may attempt further changes for the second straight contest after finally altering his starting XI for the first time last weekend. Adama Traore, however, failed to make much of an impact as right wing back Matt Doherty had the side's two best chances at AMEX Stadium.\nCoady is hoping the prime-time kickoff will give a boost to the team through their supporters as Wolves have claimed eight points through their first five home contests (2-2-1) in the top flight.\n\"What it",
        "baseline": " does do is get you looking forward to a game under the lights,\" Coady told the club's official website. \"There's nothing better than a game under the lights, it's brilliant, especially here at Molineux, because the crowd are electric at the best of times.\"\nWolves do not have any injuries of note, while Spurs continue to be without central defender Jan Vertonghen. With Eriksen and Alli playing 83 and 63 minutes, respectively, versus West Ham, Sissoko and Lamela are likely to be restored to Pochettino's first XI.\nThis will be the first meeting between the clubs since Wolves were last in the top flight in 2011-12. Tottenham are unbeaten in the last four matchups (2-2-0) and are 4-2-2 against them in the Premier League era. Wolverhampton's lone win in four tries against the Lilywhites at Molienux was a 1-0 victory in 2010.",

        "prompt": "Diversity On 'The Walking Dead' Wasn't Always Handled Well AMC's hit zombie drama The Walking Dead airs its midseason finale Sunday. It's now one of TV's most diverse shows, but critic Eric Deggans says it hasn't always served non-white characters well.\nAMC's \"The Walking Dead\" has been scoring top ratings with young TV viewers. This Sunday, the show airs its midseason finale. It's taking a break until February. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans has been watching the show, and as he explains, \"The Walking Dead\" is a prime example of a show that learned how to handle diversity right after a few seasons of getting it wrong. And, be warned, there be spoilers ahead.\nERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: The \"Walking Dead\" recently aired a scene which could be considered the show's manifesto. It was delivered by a character named Bob Stookey, talking to hero Rick Grimes about keeping your humanity in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.\nLAWRENCE GILLIARD: (As Bob Stookey) We push ourselves to let things go. Then we let some more go. And if you let too much go along the way, that's not going to work.\nANDREW LINCOLN: (As Rick Grimes) This is the real world, Bob.\n>>GILLIARD (As Bob Stookey) Nah. This is a nightmare, and nightmares end.\nDEGGANS: But what I noticed was that the scene included five characters, and Rick was the only white person on screen. \"The Walking Dead\" has quietly assembled one of the most ethnically diverse casts on a top-rated TV show. It has at least seven major non-white characters, including Michonne, a sword-swinging African-American heroine and fan favorite. Danai Gurira, the actress who plays Michonne, explains her characters pivotal role on AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" aftershow, \"Talking Dead.\"\nDANAI GURIRA: She's the person who will step in at those moments when someone really needs to step in. She steps in and goes and helps to get the medicine. She steps in, you know, and stabs the governor when he's trying to kill Rick.\nDEGGANS: When the show first started, critics like me argued its two African-American characters didn't reflect the diversity of its setting around Atlanta, Georgia, with a population that's more than 50 percent black. And the racial conflicts on the show were often cartoonish, as shown by this fight between white Southerner Merle Dixon and a black man, Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas.\nROBERT SINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) You got something you want to tell me?\nJUAN GABRIEL PAREJA: (As Morales) Hey, T-Dog, man, just leave it.\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) No.\nMICHAEL ROOKER: (As Merle Dixon) You want to know today? It's the day I take orders from a [bleep].\nPAREJA: (As Morales) Hey, come on, Merle, that's enough.\nDEGGANS: For a while, T-Dog was the show's only black character, given little backstory and few lines. He even complained about his situation, but only when he was delirious from an infection.\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) And I'm the one black guy. Realize how precarious that makes my situation?\nJEFFREY DEMUNN: (As Dale Horvath) What the hell are you talking about?\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) I'm talking about two good ol' boy cowboy sheriffs and a redneck whose brother cut off his own hand because I dropped a key. Who in that scenario you think is going to be first to get lynched?\nDEGGANS: The situation changed when \"The Walking Dead\" TV show began adding popular characters of color from the graphic",

And \"The Wire\" alum Seth Gilliam plays a tortured priest named Gabriel who locked himself inside his church when the zombies came.\nSETH GILLIAM: (As Father Gabriel Stokes) They started coming. My congregation - they were looking for a safe place, a place where they felt safe. Trying to pry the shutters and banging on the sidings screaming at me - and so the dead came for them.\nDEGGANS: These aren't just tokens. They're fully fleshed out characters, created as \"The Walking Dead\" has become the most popular series on TV with the young demographic advertisers crave. It's another example of how creating a cast that looks like America is good for TV stories and the TV business, even in a zombie apocalypse. I'm Eric Deggans.",

It releases its albums, including the recent “Techarí” (“Free”) and a follow-up album of remixes, on its own label, Diquela Records (distributed here by Six Degrees).\nA Gypsy guitarist, Ramón Giménez, and a heel-stamping dancer, Sonia Poveda, connect the band to Barcelona’s flamenco tradition, and Ms. Abad sometimes sings in a Spanish Gypsy dialect. Flamenco plus Afro-Cuban percussion leads Ojos de Brujo to the rumba-flamenco that’s a big part of European pop.\nBut the band doesn’t stop there. Its songs also use funk vamps, ska and reggae beats, Indian tabla drumming, hard-rock riffs, hip-hop turntable scratching and live beatboxing. There’s also rapid-fire rapping from Ms. Azad, DJ Panko and the band’s founder and main songwriter, the percussionist Xavier Turull, who sometimes plays the traditional box-shaped drum used for flamenco, the cajón.\nOnstage, Ojos de Brujo played as if musical energy could drive a revolution. A video screen behind the band showed crumbling neighborhoods, time-lapse accelerated sequences of pedestrian and auto traffic, or images of war: planes, soldiers, explosions.\nSongs rarely stayed in just one style. Ms. Abad, in a Gypsy-Indian headdress and a yellow feather boa, sang with clear pop tone, raspy Gypsy declamations or floating, quasi-Indian phrases. (Gypsy culture has been traced to origins in India.) She might switch to rapping and beat-",

But passages of traditionalist flamenco, with Mr. Giménez accompanied by six-beat handclapping, were soon overlaid with DJ Panko’s scratching or Javier Martin’s thumb-popping bass lines.\nPolitical fervor fills Ojos de Brujo’s lyrics, which praise Latin American revolutionaries like Bolivar and Zapata in “Tanguillos Marineros” and denounce “megamacromultinacionales” in “El Confort No Reconforta.” But like many of its counterparts worldwide — from AfroReggae in Brazil to Antibalas in New York — the band pushes just as determinedly toward the dance floor as to the barricades.",

In the second episode premiering on Tuesday, Nov. 8 at 5:30 p.m., \"Chain Reaction,\" Po is driving Tigress nuts with his fanboy ways while they are on a mission together. Things get worse when they are attacked by Croc Bandits and wind up handcuffed together.

Turnover of group homes staff members is quite high for a variety of reasons, including burnout and low pay.\nThe early 20th-century eugenics movement saw people with disabilities as genetically flawed and supported incarcerating them in large, crowded state institutions. Nazi Germany systematically killed institutionalized physically and mentally disabled people. In the United States, a national movement advocating the closure of large state institutions began in the 1960s. Many physically and mentally challenged people moved into group homes, some run by state governments and others by private organizations.\nAn estimated 4.3 million Americans with intellectual, developmental or physical disabilities live in group homes, their own homes or with family members, according to the federal Health and Human Services Department. Their disabilities include autism, Down syndrome, mental illness and many other medical conditions. Disabled persons living in group homes and some of those living in their own homes are cared for by staff called direct support professionals or DSPs. They are also referred to as home health and personal care aides. DSPs working in group homes and providing in-home care have high turnover rates. A 2006 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, \"The Supply of Direct Support Professionals Serving Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and Other Developmental Disabilities,\" estimated that the national turnover rate for DSPs working in group homes and in-home care was 53.6 percent between 1998 and 2003.\nA 2001 study, \"Issues in the Direct Support Workforce,\" produced by the American Network of Community Options and Resources, analyzes the reasons why turnover among DSPs working in group homes is so high. Prior to the 1960s, DSPs were typically government employees working for large state institutions. While some state institutions were brutal, mismanaged and overcrowded, DSPs had structured jobs and were often trained and supervised by medical personnel in carrying out a variety of planned programs. The shift to small group houses that are frequently run by private organizations has left many DSPs lacking needed training and supervision in an era when the medical complexity of care needed by intellectually and physically disabled persons has increased. In addition, DSP jobs are seen by most Americans as poorly paid, low status, lacking promotion opportunities and offering few employee benefits, leading to high turnover and chronic understaffing. DSPs are paid a median yearly salary of $20,170",
        "baseline": ".\nThe average DSP is a woman between the ages of 18 to 39. A third of all DSPs have college degrees, and many are minorities or recent immigrants to the United States. Faced with physically and emotionally demanding responsibilities, overwork due to staff shortages, inadequate training, low pay, few opportunities for advancement and sometimes receiving no employee benefits such as health insurance and vacation time, many leave the profession for other jobs. Job vacancies for DSPs are projected to grow by 70 percent between 2010 and 2020, due to the aging of the baby boomers. A Montgomery County, Maryland, study of DSPs found that agencies that paid their DSPs $10 per hour or higher showed dramatically lower turnover and vacancy rates. Securing added funding for DSP salaries is a complex problem as much of the care for persons with disabilities is controlled by state and federal budgets.\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Nazi Persecution of the Disabled -- Murder of the \"Unfit\"",

This is driven by a number of negative factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its feeble growth in its earnings per share, deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, weak operating cash flow and generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself.\"\nRUBICON TECHNOLOGY INC's earnings per share declined by 50.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share have declined over the last two years. We anticipate that this should continue in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, RUBICON TECHNOLOGY INC reported poor results of -$1.34 versus -$0.25 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 19.4% in earnings (-$1.60 versus -$1.34).\nThe company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 69.4% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$5.89 million to -$9.98 million.\nReturn on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior.

Consistent with the plunge in the stock price, the company's earnings per share are down 50.00% compared to the year-earlier quarter. Naturally, the overall market trend is bound to be a significant factor.

But now, researchers led by Brian MacGowan of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California have managed to squeeze targets of material into spheres rather than pancakes or more lopsided shapes, paving the way for future attempts at fusion.\nThe work was performed at Livermore’s 192-laser beam National Ignition Facility (NIF), which began operating in 2009.\nThe team used targets that did not contain the key ingredients for fusion – two isotopes of hydrogen known as deuterium and",
        "baseline": " tritium. But the symmetrical implosion of the targets suggests that NIF should be able to ignite fusion with laser pulses of 1.2 to 1.3 megajoules – well below its full 1.8-megajoule capacity.\n“From everything we can see, we’re on the right path here,” Jeff Wisoff, a top NIF manager told New Scientist.\nResearchers spent last year slowly cranking up the output of the laser, ultimately reaching a total energy of more than 1 megajoule. Now they’re pausing to mount new instruments on the 10-centimetre-thick aluminium target chamber and to install giant concrete doors to contain neutrons they expect to produce in future fusion experiments.\nIn a few months, they will begin testing a series of new targets designed to assess beam interactions and compression. If all goes well, they could try for fusion ignition by the end of the year.",

        "prompt": "In 2017, fewer officers died in the line of duty than from suicide.\nIt was a big day at David and Melissa Swailes’ home on Feb. 26, 2016. It was their youngest son’s second birthday.\n“We had planned, as a family to go to Disneyland,” said Melissa Swailes.\nBut when she arrived home that day, Melissa found David dead inside their master bathroom. He had shot himself. David was a decade-long veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department. After serving in the military and then as an LAPD officer, David began suffering symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. He had a hard time sleeping, and would go into fits of paranoia, Melissa said.\nBelieving that he’d be taken off patrol if his commanders found out about his mental illness, David kept his struggle private. He self-medicated with food, which his family thought was better than drugs, alcohol or infidelity. But on the day he promised Melissa that he’d tell his captain about his PTSD, he killed himself.\n(Melissa Swailes) David Swailes’ department graduation photo.\n“The last thing he told me was, ‘Take care of the boys. I love you. And then he hung up,” Melissa recalled, speaking of their final phone conversation before she returned home.\nNationwide, statistics show that more police officers are dying from suicide than from on-duty deaths. A 2018 study by the Ruderman Family Foundation, a private philanthropic organization, found that in 2017 there were 129 police officers killed in the line of duty compared to 140 officer suicides. The group found that little has been done nationwide to deal with mental health issues like PTSD and depression within police ranks.\nSince her husband’s death, Melissa has talked openly about her story in hopes of preventing more officer suicides, even being featured in a PSA for the LAPD, which has been working to reduce those rising numbers.\nThe department’s unique Behavioral Science Services unit, known as BSS, is on a mission to end suicides. A staff of 16 psychologists has one goal: treating the minds of close to 10,000 LAPD officers in an effort to prevent suicidal or violent and harmful behavior.\nLike many departments, LAPD officers are mandated to see a psychologist after a shooting or a major incident, but having in-house psych services makes seeing a doctor a slightly less scary experience for the many officers who might otherwise avoid “shrinks” because of the stigma associated with them. BSS is celebrating its 50th year in service, and the unit will mark the occasion with a ceremony in October.\n(Melissa Swailes) David Swailes at an LAPD Special Olympics event.\n“Officers can come in and see us anytime,” said Denise Jablonski-Kaye, PhD, a psychologist in the LAPD’s Behavioral Sciences Services Unit, who sat down with ABC News at police headquarters to talk about the unit’s objectives.\n“We don’t charge for services. We even validate officers’ parking. There’s no cap on the number of sessions that they can have. And they’re talking to somebody who talks their language, who understands their job, who understands the agency,” she explained.\nBSS is the longest running in-house police psych unit in the country. Psychologists on staff spend time at LAPD stations, go on ride-alongs, deploy to the field to help officers during stressful events and employ early intervention methods to recognize officers who may be in the primary stages of stress, addiction and anxiety issues. LAPD personnel can also call BSS to check on officers who might be showing signs of problems in their lives.\nFor officers who need help, doctors are available around the clock.\nMembers of BSS have to walk a fine line where they’re not prematurely sidelining an officer just because they might be having a bad day or because something in their lives is making them emotional — they have to make sure the person actually poses a danger to themselves or others.\n(Melissa Swailes) The Swailes family enjoying an LAPD picnic.\nEven if an officer has their service weapon taken away, they are able to get it back and return to the field after treatment, once they’re cleared by doctors and department leadership.\n“We absolutely have people right now, here today, who have had their gun taken away, and returned, and they’re back on the job. They’re doing well. They’re happy and healthy. This was a moment in time that was terrible and awful for them, but they got through it,” said Jablonski-Kaye.\nThe cause of the officers’ stress doesn’t always have to be on the job, either. Many officers seek help from BSS because of issues at home, and it’s still all free and confidential.\n“The main issues that they come for are relationship problems, and that’s what you generally see in the general population as well. Their relationship isn’t going well. They",
        "baseline": "’d like to get out of the relationship they’re in. Or, they’re in too many relationships. It’s usually relationship problems,” according to Jablonski-Kaye.\n(Melissa Swailes) David Swailes taking a selfie on patrol.\nThe LAPD has historically seen about two suicides per year within its ranks, but there has not been a suicide in the department since July 2017. “My mission really has been zero suicides in [the] LAPD,” Jablonski-Kaye said.\n“The year that we lost David Swailes we also lost a female detective, and both deaths had a very significant impact on the department. Both of these deaths caught us all by surprise, and for me, I felt that I needed to do more, have a greater impact, and work to get the department to really see saving our officers as a priority,” she added.",

        "prompt": "U.S. Army 1st Lt. William A. Warner Jr. was killed in late 1944 in Germany, and he was buried at Adrennes American Cemetery in Neupré, Belgium.\nMERRITT ISLAND — In late 1944, intense enemy gunfire pinned down U.S. Army 1st Lt. William A. Warner Jr.'s infantry company near an undisclosed German village, during the waning months of World War II.\nMoving at the head of his troops, Warner led his squad on a daring assault targeting the enemy strongpoint. But he was cut down by machine-gun fire — creating questions that remain unanswered to his relatives a full 74 years later.\nWednesday morning, Warner's daughter, Jeanne Hall, was finally awarded his Silver Star, Purple Heart and other long-belated military honors during a solemn ceremony at the Brevard Veterans Memorial Center.\nHall was just 3 years old when her father was killed overseas at age 30. She received the medals and a flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol in her father's memory from Rob Medina, U.S. Rep. Bill Posey's director of community and military relations.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, to me this was an emotional moment. It brings back the life and memory of a hero. And that's what this nation was founded on,\" Medina told the audience.\n\"He placed his life in a leadership capacity on the altar of freedom. Freedom is not free. Blood is shed. And Lt. Warner shed his blood so that we can be free,\" Medina said.\n\"We honor you, Miss Hall, for the sacrifices laid on that altar by your father,\" he said.\nAn Alabama native, Hall lives in Melbourne Beach. The retiree who works as an H&R Block enrolled agent never knew much about her father's war years — \"just how sad my grandmother and my mother were,\" she recalled.\n\"My grandmother's three children all went off to war. My aunt was a Navy nurse. And my father's brother served in World War II and the Korean War,\" Hall said.\n\"I had made inquiries in the past, and my mother had, but there was no information at that time,\" she said of her late father's military service.\nMore than a year ago, Hall's friend Charlotte Neal — who attended Huntsville High with her in Alabama — contacted Posey's office and asked for research help. However, Medina said only limited historical resources were available.\n\"A lot of the information regarding the circumstances surrounding 1st Lt. Warner were destroyed in a fire back in 1973 from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis,\" Medina told the crowd.\n\"But they persevered. And we were able to obtain those documents to confirm his gallantry,\" he said.\nIn addition to the Silver Star and Purple Heart, Hall received her father's European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one bronze service star, World War II Victory Medal and Presidential Unit Citation. Medina also pinned a Gold Star Lapel Button to her royal-blue blouse.\nVolunteers will help Hall get a shadow box to display the medals, said Donn Weaver, chairman of the Brevard Veterans Council.\nWarner was buried in 1945",

The regiment landed on Utah Beach on July 4-5, 1944, then advanced into Germany.\nMedina said the date of Warner's death — possibly Dec. 1, 1944 — remains unknown, as does the location of his fateful battle. If more documentation emerges, he may become eligible for additional military honors, Medina said.\nNeal's late husband, Mike Christian, a Navy A-6 Intruder bombardier-navigator, was a Vietnam War prisoner of war from 1967-73. A Melbourne resident, Neal reconnected with Hall in Brevard County 48 years after their high school days.\n\"Very emotional: I realized it a couple days ago when I sent an email to her classmates that we went to high school with in Alabama.

The system would constantly notify me that usb's and such weren't getting enough power. Occasionally the system wouldn't turn on or had trouble turning on because of this low power issue. It might boot for a second than shut down, then boot again, then shut down. Well usually after several tries the thing starts up again and works fine, even under stress of some games. About a month ago I was having the same issue of starting up the computer than it shutting down. Then the computer just died. The motherboard showed no signs of life at all. The troubleshooting LED's wouldn't turn on, nor would any of the case fans or lights.\nAt this point I figured it was the PSU so I bought a 750 watt one to replace it. Still the same issue. (tested the PSU on another motherboard and it worked).\nNow I figured it would be a dead P67 motherboard. So I recently bought another one. The new motherboard also won't work. No troubleshooting LED's, no spinning fans but I feel heat coming from the motherboard.\nAnyone have an Idea what's wrong with my system? Dead CPU? Dead motherboards?\nWhat does it mean when the troubleshooting LED's on the mobo won't even light up?\nRe: Two Dead AsRock P67 Extreme 4 Gen 3 motherboards?\nWe can best help you when you add a detailed hardware list to your forum signature.\nBe sure to include brand and model numbers, bios version etc. and include a link to your specific memory kit.\nStep #1 in the middle of post #5 in http://forums.tweaktown.com/gigabyte...tml#post295784 has instructions for editing your forum signature.\nIf your 750 watt psu is a cheapy model, that might be part of the problem.\nThere are many reasonably priced, high quality power supplies available.\nI'm a firm believer in buying a quality power supply that passes the demanding tests performed by Jonnyguru, HardOCP, HardwareSecrets, PCPER, TechPowerUP, etc. Sometimes there are",

She denied having offered an apology to settle the matter and called for the inquiry into Mr Austin to also be halted.\nIn an interview with the Evening Standard, Barking MP Dame Margaret – who is herself Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust – said the Labour Party had become a “hostile environment for Jews”.\nAsked if she believed there was a “purge” of Mr Corbyn’s critics under way, she replied: “I have absolutely no doubt that there are those in the leadership who want to get rid, whether it is through deselection or disciplinary action, of any opposition.\nThe Hamlins letter, dated August 1 and published on Tuesday on Mr Austin’s Twitter feed, said that the Dudley MP, whose adoptive father was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis, had been subjected to a “Kafkaesque” disciplinary process.\nA letter on July 19 informing him that he was under investigation for “abusive conduct” in Parliament, gave no details of the alleged incident, but “senior party sources” were quoted in the press claiming that he had intimidated party chairman Ian Lavery.\nIn a July 24 meeting with chief whip Nick Brown, he was told that complaints had been made by Mr Lavery and left-wing MP Chris Williamson.\nA letter from Mr Brown two days later said there had been complaints that he “approached other MPs unasked and asserted your point of view in a loud and aggressive manner, thereby creating an incident”.\nMr Brown also said there had been “other incidents of a similar nature”. He formally warned Mr Austin against “any repeat of such behaviour” and issued a reprimand for what he said were “a number of complaints”.\nHamlins said it was “completely inappropriate and contrary to the rules of natural justice” for Mr Austin to have been issued with a warning and reprimand without being given details of the allegations against him or an opportunity to defend himself.\nThe lawyers demanded immediate details of the substance of complaints and the identity of the person conducting any investigation, as well as an assurance that the probe would not be led by anyone from Mr Corbyn’s office.\nThe inquiry into Dame Margaret came after a heated exchange last month in which she was said to have called Mr Corbyn an",

In the week after their worst stretch of the first half of the season (four victories, five losses), the Yankees won three of four games from the National League-best Atlanta Braves and the first two games of the Mets series, from which they have wrenched the promised excitement because they are so good.\n''They're such a well-balanced club,'' Mike Piazza, the Mets' catcher, said with admiration after the Yankees won convincingly yesterday at Shea Stadium, 7-2.\nThe Mets did some things wrong, but so did the Yankees, and the Mets still could not beat them. The Yankees uncharacteristically made three errors, but the Mets were able to score only one run with them. The Mets committed two errors, and the Yankees scored six runs as a result.\n''I dropped that ball, then they got a hit and a home run, and before you know it, we're down by two,'' said the Mets' John Olerud, talking about his dropped throw at first base in the fourth inning that preceded Darryl Strawberry's single and a home run by Tino Martinez, the Yankees' second decisive three-run home run in the series.\nIn the seventh inning, Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez hit Jorge Posada with the ball when he tried to throw him out at third base, and the Yankees proceeded to score three more runs and make the Mets wonder if they could do anything to salvage the last game of the series tonight.\nOn Friday night, Piazza said, ''We had them on the ropes and weren't able to punch a big inning.'' And the Mets lost, 8-4. Yesterday, he added, the Mets squandered the opportunities the Yankees handed them. And the Mets lost.\nSo",

But the Braves won primarily with pitching and at times found themselves short in other areas. The Yankees short in any area? If they are, no one has uncovered it yet.\nSo can anyone beat this team?\nBut even Cone acknowledged that the Yankees have an uncanny knack for having a different player or players step up each game and get the big hit or make the big play or throw the big pitch that results in a victory.\nThe Yankees behave themselves.

        "prompt": "Microfishing targets smallest fish by CINDY DAMPIER CHICAGO TRIBUNE | December 5, 2017 at 1:00 a.m.\nCHICAGO — Gerry Hansell’s well equipped for a lucky weekday afternoon spent fishing — microfishing, to be specific. It’s the art of chasing not trophy bass nor trout, but tiny species most fishermen regard as bait, if they regard them at all.\nHansell’s rod is so small it collapses to fit in a pocket. His hook? So minuscule as to be nearly invisible. And he’s brought an almost embarrassing surplus, a whole cup of wigglers he retrieved from the back of his fridge. He cracks the lid of the cardboard cup and shrugs. Today he will need only a tiny chunk of flesh to bait his hook. His entire expedition won’t require even one whole worm.\nMicrofishing involves line fishing for species that rarely grow above a few inches in length, some warier and rarer than others. The activity has been slowly attracting a devoted following in the U.S. The Midwest contains a healthy concentration of microfishing enthusiasts.\n“People are interested in something novel, something new,” says Ben Cantrell, who started the website micro-fishing.com.\nHansell, an avid angler who has been microfishing for about a year, chooses a trickle of water off the main stream, peering into puddle-depth pools.\nWithin minutes, he feels a tug and hoists his thrashing quarry from the stream, slick, wet, shining in the sun. He holds up a fish barely longer than one joint of his finger.

He quickly discovered that a community of microfishermen already existed. Among them was Cantrell, a mechanical engineer, who started microfishing in 2008.\nTo pursue new species, anglers must research available species in each waterway and then cross-reference their catch with field guides and other fishermen for positive identification.\nMicrofishing involves line fishing for species that rarely grow above a few inches in length, some warier and rarer than others.",

        "prompt": "Split decision: In the backdrop of efforts to shore up Michigan's beleaguered racing industry is the question of how to split purses between the two remaining tracks: Northville Downs and Hazel Park Raceway (pictured).\nThe Michigan Senate last week passed two bills, 504 and 505, which would update Michigan's horse racing statute. They now move to the House agriculture committee for consideration.\nRep. Dan Lauwers, a Republican from St. Clair County's Brockway Township and committee chairman, told Crain's he expects to hold a hearing on the bills as soon as this week.\nA separate package was introduced in the House by Rep. Jon Bumstead, R-Newaygo, but House Bills 5600 and 5601 have not moved. Lauwers said he expects to take up the Senate bills.\nLANSING — After years of sparring about the best way to split the pot, Michigan's two remaining horse tracks have found some common ground when it comes to divvying up the money from bets placed on horse races.\nThat consensus, though, hasn't yet reached other parts of the business that owners of both tracks say will be necessary if the industry is going to be relevant in the 21st century — namely, the introduction of electronic wagering.\nPast efforts didn't bear fruit. And now the tracks — Hazel Park Raceway, which holds thoroughbred races, and Northville Downs, which runs standardbred harness races — find themselves on opposite sides of proposed legislation that initially attempted to resolve the issue.\nExecutives at Northville Downs say the bill as written is a nonstarter, even after a controversial provision that would have allowed some Internet-based wagering at the tracks was stripped from the bill on the Senate floor.\nIn response, Hazel Park Raceway and its affiliated horsemen's group, the Howell-based Michigan Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, say they intend to ask the Michigan Gaming Control Board to pursue online wagering as an administrative rule change, rather than in statute.\nThe practice, known as advance deposit wagering, would allow people to place bets on simulcast races from their cellphones or tablets without having to visit a track. Current law requires anyone betting on horse racing to do so from within a track.\nHazel Park and Northville Downs consider online betting on horse races an extension of what they already do, replacing paper with the mobile devices that people carry everywhere. The Michigan Lottery has introduced online games, which track owners believe is essentially the same thing.\nAnd because more than 95 percent of the tracks' wagering revenue comes from people who place bets on simulcast races, rather than live ones, the interest in electronic wagering is also financial. The tracks say they're competing for business against out-of-state mobile wagering sites that don't pay state taxes and don't offer a cut of the proceeds to support either track and their affiliated horse owners' group.\nEarlier versions of Senate Bill 504, sponsored by state Sen. David Robertson, included a provision that would have allowed the horse track with the larger handle during the past five years to operate advance deposit wagering.\nBy numbers alone, Hazel Park had the larger simulcast handle — $56.6 million in 2015, compared to $45 million for Northville Downs, according to Michigan Gaming Control Board figures.\n\"I would have had to take everybody to court,\" said Mike Carlo, Northville Downs' operations manager. \"That was the biggest slap in the face I've ever seen in this industry.\n\"In our world, we live under the purview of our license,\" he added. \"Basically, what it would have done is it would have said that Hazel Park has a different license to operate pari-mutuel wagering in a manner that Northville Downs can't.\"\nThe bill that passed the Senate does not include that language. Instead, it would allow Michigan's racing commissioner to draft administrative rules to govern the practice.\nThe Michigan Gaming Control Board, which regulates the horse industry along with Detroit's three commercial casinos, opposed the earlier version of the bill. Robertson, R-Grand Blanc Township, said the board and harness racing groups wanted the language removed.\nA 2004 amendment to the Michigan Constitution requires a statewide vote for any expansion of gaming. The board has not yet publicly said whether it would consider authorizing advance deposit wagering.\nRobertson, track owners and horsemen's groups all say they don't believe the practice would violate the constitutional provision.\n\"The (board) will have to see what the options and its authority are if the bill becomes law,\" gaming board spokeswoman Mary Kay Bean said via email.\nThe bill could get a hearing in the House agriculture committee this week after clearing the Senate last week in a 30-7 vote.\nThe bill would alter how purses are distributed between the state's two remaining tracks: Hazel Park Raceway and Northville Downs (pictured).\nRobertson's bill would be the first update to Michigan's 1995 horse racing statute. Among other things, it would rewrite the formula that distributes revenue from wagers.\nCurrently, all wagers placed on simulcast races at Hazel Park and Northville Downs are pooled into a common purse, where it's split between the tracks and horsemen's groups. Track owners say that setup made more sense years ago, when Michigan had more horse tracks in operation.\nBut waning interest in horse racing led to the closure of seven tracks since 1998, leaving just two tracks. Hazel Park and Northville Downs essentially compete for the same audience, despite the fact that they don't race the same breeds of horses, and have lost money as the wagering pool decreased. Thus, competition for market share has become increasingly important.\nToday, the common purse is divided in a way that offers roughly 65 percent of the proceeds to the harness racing standardbreds, after winners and a 3.5 percent state tax are paid, with the rest going to the thoroughbreds.\nRobertson's bill would eliminate the common purse in favor of a \"site-specific\" model, meaning all of the wagers placed at Northville Downs and Hazel Park would stay at the respective tracks.\n\"Horse racing has had very tough times. It's been diminishing as a sport, and this is an attempt to try to amend the law in a way that will help all of racing,\" Robertson said. \"This language is archaic.\"\nNorthville Downs agreed to the funding formula change, which ultimately is a concession that would award them a smaller share of the simulcast purse pool than they receive now.\nBut Carlo and the Michigan Harness Horsemen's Association say the change triggers a problem with a different section of the bill, which they believe would require Hazel Park's owners to sign off each time Northville Downs wanted to simulcast a thoroughbred horse race.\nTheir fear is that Hazel Park and thoroughbred groups could block Northville Downs from simulcasting the Kentucky Derby, for instance, since the money collected under the new model would not be shared with Hazel Park and thoroughbred owners.\n\"Since the dawn of simulcasting, all tracks have taken all breeds,\" said Tom Barrett, president of the harness horsemen's group. \"We are only going to support a bill that treats both tracks the same.\"\nGeorge Kutlenios, president of the thoroughbred horsemen's association, said his group doesn't intend to prevent Northville Downs from showing thoroughbred races.\n\"I don't know why we would not want to send a signal,\" Kutlenios said. \"The more signals, the more product you have to offer. I can't even envision a scenario where that makes sense.\"\nThe fight over simulcast revenue in some ways explains the desire for advance deposit wagering.\nSimulcast wagers contributed $3.6 million in state tax revenue last year, a drop of 9 percent from 2014, according to the gaming control board. And the roughly $106 million wagered on live and simulcast races last year is well below the $261 million bet in 2007.\nKutlenios said he has heard some industry estimates peg the amount wagered illegally in Michigan through services in other states at between $90 million and $120 million.\nRobertson also sponsored Senate Bill 505, which would make it a felony to accept wagers on live or simulcast horse races in Michigan without a license. That bill also moved to the House.\nProponents say they want to stop",
        "baseline": " vendors like TwinSpires, which is owned by Churchill Downs, from taking unlicensed wagers from potential track visitors that otherwise could be used to support Michigan's race tracks.\n\"There are people right now on site using their phones but not wagering even through us,\" said Dan Adkins, vice president of Southfield-based real estate developer Hartman and Tyner Inc., whose owners have an ownership stake in Hazel Park Raceway.\nCarlo, of Northville Downs, said Michigan's horse tracks could make inroads into the market for advance deposit wagering if a third-party vendor managed it on behalf of both tracks, rather than allowing one track to operate at the expense of the other.\n\"We're in favor of it being in place somehow and some way,\" he said, \"but I don't think we have figured out the best way for our industry in Michigan.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the ownership structure of Hazel Park Raceway.",

In addition to its 32-acre hospital campus, it includes two school-based clinics, junior chef training, medical care and education for at-risk mothers and infants, youth health screenings and residential development in the Hickory Townhomes Project.\nAvondale is home to 12,500 residents, 90 percent of whom are African-American. It is historically one of the city’s most dangerous and impoverished neighborhoods, beset by poor health for children and adults.\n• $10 million in community development will place a high priority on residential housing throughout the neighborhood, with specific projects to include Burnet Avenue revitalization and Hickory Place. The latter project has sold eight townhomes for market prices approaching $200,000. Another eight are under construction and a final set of eight could rise before the end of the year. Housing efforts will be coordinated by the Avondale Community Council, Avondale Comprehensive Development Corp. and other developers, including the Uptown Consortium.\n• $1.55 million in grants to nonprofits already working in Avondale to improve child and community health through a variety of programs. Those include the Gabriel’s Place food ministry, Avondale Youth Council, Center for Closing the Health Gap, Every Child Succeeds and Greater Cincinnati Urban League.\n• A renewed commitment to workforce development, such as job-readiness classes offered by the Urban League. Children’s officials say the center will “maintain a high standard for workforce diversity.” The jobless rate in Avondale is historically high, reaching about 40 percent during the height of the Great Recession, say neighborhood agency heads.\nIn addition to Children’s building on its own investment in Avondale, the neighborhood’s Reading Road corridor is undergoing a housing transformation under the $29.5 million, five-year Choice Neighborhoods grant operated by nonprofit developer The Community Builders.\nTo ensure success, Children’s officials say, three oversight committees are in place.

        "prompt": "A screenshot of game’s main screen.\nFor $13, the recently released Wii U game A Day At The Carnival doesn’t give you much. The mini-game collection takes place in a desolate wasteland, with nothing to be seen except gravel, sky, and oddly colored tents. Sound will only come from the Wii U controller’s speakers. Sometimes, its graphics don’t fit on the screen. If you decide to play skeeball, good luck figuring out how to aim. If you throw the ball, you can’t even see where it lands.\nWho makes a game like this? The credits trace the game back to Thornbury Software, the founder of which is Robert Thornbury, a 59-year-old former factory worker in Winchester, Indiana who says he used to work 22-hour days between the factory and making games. A Day At The Carnival is what it is, he argues, because it is for kids.\nBy earning enough points in the games, you can win teddy bears.\nIt’s not inherently clear why targeting games to children would excuse some of the problems in A Day At The Carnival, but Robert Thornbury is clear that he’s probably not making games for me or you. While making another of his games, 2016’s Call of the West, he said he was approached by people he knew in Winchester. A lot of whom had grandchildren, and they wanted him to make games suitable for the whole family to enjoy.\nYou can, in fact, beat the skeeball and dart throwing games in A Day at the Carnival quite easily. As long as you aim in the general direction and press the throwing button, you’re sure to score some points.\nHe says that his neighbors have responded positively to his games.\nThe game does have at least one fan there. On Nintendo’s social media service Miiverse, someone called AppleFun! excitedly shares their scores with other players. A checkmark on their post indicates they actually own the game.\nUser AppleFun! posted this journal in the game’s Wii U community.\nHowever, on that same service, other users are much more negative. They’ve called it a “pile of trash” and “awful,” among other things.\nOne user comments that he would prefer to give 13 dollars to another person rather than spend 13 dollars on A Day at the Carnival.\nAnother user expresses disdain for the graphics in A Day at the Carnival.\nBecause of all the negative comments that he received about his game online, Thornbury attempted to change the description for the game on Nintendo’s website to establish that Carnival was geared towards children. The company has not changed the description. Thornbury says he thinks they won’t change it either because they like the controversy, or maybe because they are busy.\nIn this minigame, you walk through a tunnel that shakes, rattles, and rolls.\nSome makers of bad games come off as greedy charlatans trying to make a quick buck, others like dreamers who can’t turn their ambitions into compelling reality. Thornbury seems different. When we spoke, he sounded earnest but overwhelmed, remarking that his company can’t compete with giants like Naughty Dog and Microsoft. His creations aren’t innovative, but focus on the desire to serve up some nostalgic pleasures by making games about archery and carnivals. When he talks about the games he has made or hopes to make, he sounds like a man who got the passion to program long ago, but has had little time to get the training to meet modern expectations. You can see it in the screenshots on Thornbury Software’s website or in A Day At The Carnival as it runs sluggishly on the Wii U: these are games that look like they were built for Windows 95.\nThornbury is unsure about exactly when he first learned to make games. But he says he remembers that that back when he was in school, he had to create a tic tac toe game, a chess game, and a checkers game. Thornbury says he developed his programming skills decades ago by working with DOS, and later with Windows. He launched Thornbury Software in 1992 after he wanted to market a checkers game that he wrote.\nThese days, he programs the games, while his business partner, Tannis Stants, does the artwork and animation. The company’s first major game was 2016’s The Call of the West, which is available as a PC game. It’s about a girl named Abby who decides to explore the Wild West. The next three games, A Day at the Carnival, Archery, and Shooting Range were designed to be “quick and dirty games” to be played on the now-defunct Playstation Mobile.\nIn this skeeball game, you’ll notice that the graphics are offscreen and that it’s relatively easy to win a teddy bear. However, you can’t see where the ball lands.\nUntil recently, he wasn’t primarily a game developer. Over the years, he’s had to work factory jobs to make ends meet. He assembled locks for Honda hoods at a Marujun plant. Last year, after Marujun was bought out, he began working at a TOA factory, where he welded Subaru frames together. Thornbury estimated he worked 40 hours a week at the factory, and another 50 hours at Thornbury Software.\nThornbury left his factory job a month ago. He says his company now employs six people and is profitable, though he declined to share any sales numbers.\nWhile his post-factory work schedule is better, he hasn’t really stopped working. Typically, he starts his morning around seven o’clock and checks emails and Facebook. He said that he keeps a notebook of",
        "baseline": " things he has to do around the office. On the day I interviewed him, Thornbury said he had six pages worth of things to do. This week, they have a brainstorming session for future games.\nNow that Thornbury’s back to working with the company full time, they have big plans. They are remaking Call of the West, seeking investor help, and plan to start using the Unreal Engine.\nThey’re also moving over to more grown-up games, and instead of doing a first-person shooter, they’re going to focus on third person shooters. Thornbury thinks that switching to content for older audiences will give them the ability to develop more complex storylines, and now that they have Unreal, they can make better graphics.\nThornbury hopes people think his games are fun, or at least play his games and find themselves craving other stuff to play.\nYou can check out the company’s full list of games here.",

        "prompt": "Imagine if it were a friend, a family member, or even a guy down the street to whom it happened. Imagine if the full weight of the federal government’s ponderous and powerful law enforcement, judiciary, and intelligence communities put their sights squarely on them, joined by ignorant and eager fellow travelers from media and the entertainment industry.\nConstantly and gleefully they attack that person and tear apart the lives of their friends, family, and business associates, ripping apart life after life on an expedition rivaling that of Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in expense, effort, and likelihood of finding the intended result.\nEven better, imagine if it were you.\nRepublicans celebrating victory after the exoneration of the president have even forgotten the true tragedy of what has happened to President Donald J. Trump. Too many treated this like a game won and have forgotten that the president and all those around him have paid a steep price for the entire time that this investigation has taken place.\nSo, just for a minute, imagine that Donald Trump does not have billions of dollars. Imagine that he is not the president of the United States. Forget that he has an abrasive style that might or might not rub you the wrong way. Imagine that he is another child of God, like you and me. Then put yourself in this human being’s shoes.\nIf this were you, how would you process it? Armchair pundits on either side sugarcoat it, saying “if you are innocent, you have nothing to worry about.” That wipes away the very real human response to a continual Sword of Damocles hanging over your head. We know that in many cases, such as that of Conrad Black, when prosecutors want your head they can and will manipulate the law and facts to serve you up like a spiral ham on Easter to a waiting jury. An investigatory group that spent two years and over $20 million has every incentive to comb through every detail to find something, anything, to justify what was spent.\nIn reality, no human being could endure this easily. You see the collateral damage done to friends and associates, their lives and reputations ruined to no good end. You fear for those friends and family that you love and care about, wondering who might be next sacrificed to the frivolous whim of investigators, politicians, and the media.\nThe insider jackals that pursued Donald Trump from even before the time where his presidential campaign showed signs of actual vitality used every measure at their disposal to destroy the man publicly, privately, and legally.\nIronically, the same liberals who argued against the expanded intelligence capabilities post 9/11 proved themselves right and George W. Bush supporters wrong by using the very same controversial tools to harass and destroy innocent American citizens for political motives. These included the use of secret courts and chummy back passage relationships at the highest levels. In doing so they resurrected the spirit and some of the methods of the Okhrana right here in the United States of America against its own duly elected head of state.\nOur greatest legal thinkers and jurists feared just this kind of persecution of any individual American citizen. They urged caution and restraint. John Marshall, in his opinion on United States v. Burr (1807) had to weigh the case of an infamous character. Aaron Burr infuriated his own Democratic-Republican Party by trying to steal the presidency from Thomas Jefferson. He then sealed his political fate by killing Federalist Alexander Hamilton in a duel. After authorities stopped Burr’s fruitless expedition to conquer Spanish territory, a vengeful President Jefferson declared him a traitor against the United States without a modicum of evidence.\nJohn Marshall, with every reason to despise Burr personally, penned in his opinion “if any conduct on the part of the court could warrant a sentiment that it would deviate to the one side or the other from the line prescribed by duty and by law, that conduct would be viewed by the judges themselves with an eye of extreme severity, and would long be recollected with deep and serious regret.” He and others of the Founding Father generation feared that political and social passions could pervert government and justice and sought to restrain, rather than expand, certain powers.\nChief Justice Earl Warren served during a time when presidential power expanded tremendously. This court, once referred to as liberal, in case after case fought diligently to defend the rights of individuals in the face of potentially crushing government power.\nIn this case, however, those pursuing",

They looked at his phraseology, his abrasive style in business, his occasionally aggravating campaign style, and, most importantly, his honest aspiration to return Middle America to the table of power at the expense of connected elites, namely the very people attacking him. In a bad imitation of a Tom Clancy thriller, they concluded that he must have something incriminating, then determined to find whatever it was and nail him to a cross with it.\nAgain imagine this is you, because very few people can imagine themselves as Donald Trump. Now consider the fairness. Should an innocent person endure such torment just because his character leads one to believe that he must have committed a crime, somewhere, somehow? Should this ever happen to any American citizen, no matter how powerful or vulnerable?\nIs this not both a legal travesty of justice and a human tragedy that no innocent person should ever experience based on so little actual, believable evidence?\nImagine if it were you.",

        "prompt": "Tough love from the Congressional Oversight Panel involves ripping the Band-Aid--otherwise known as TARP--off the mortally wounded banking system.\nWarren is one of a very small circle of experts who, during the boom years, accurately diagnosed the frailty of American finance capitalism. In scholarly articles, blog posts and several widely praised books, she has focused on the ways post-1970s wage stagnation has squeezed the middle class, leading to a drop in savings, a massive spike in consumer debt and more hours of labor spent to purchase core middle-class goods like healthcare and housing. The cumulative effect of these changes, as she argued in her talk at Berkeley, is families taking on far more risk than those of a generation earlier, and an economy skating on very thin ice.\nFast-forward eighteen months to the frenzied, panicked week in September after the fall of Lehman Brothers, when Henry Paulson sent his original three-page TARP proposal to Congress with the notoriously tone-deaf provision that Treasury’s decisions would be “non-reviewable…by any court of law or any administrative agency.” The provision was nearly unanimously panned, and the final Emergency Economic Stabilization Act stipulated several oversight mechanisms, including the creation of a five-member Congressional Oversight Panel. Appointed by leaders in Congress from both parties, the COP was given the task of reporting every thirty days on the program’s effectiveness, transparency and protection of taxpayers.\nOn top of that, the panel got a late start. By the time House minority leader John Boehner got around to appointing Representative Jeb Hensarling on November 19–giving the panel the requisite quorum–it had only eight days to produce its first report.\nAnd yet somehow the COP has managed to raise a considerable ruckus. Meeting at least once a week, the panel (which includes Warren, Hensarling, former Republican Senator John Sununu, AFL-CIO associate counsel Damon Silvers and Richard Neiman, superintendent of banks for the New York State banking department) has churned out four rigorous, detailed reports.\nIndeed, the report found that Treasury has already overpaid by a staggering $78 billion, or almost a third of the money it had spent at the time of the report. “They described a transaction to do one thing,” Warren says, “and it was designed from its inception to do something very different.” She doesn’t say what that “something” is, but it’s clear: subsidize the banks’ losses.\nSo what now? Charged with oversight, not with crafting policy, Warren is insistent on not offering substantive suggestions for",
        "baseline": " how the new administration should handle the TARP funds. But given that she’s a bankruptcy law professor, I pressed her on the policy options on the table and asked her to describe what a version of bankruptcy for some of the troubled banks might look like.\nThis is more or less what the FDIC has been doing, largely under the media radar, with numerous small, failed banks at an alarming rate of about two a week for the past few months. Of course, that would mean facing up to massive losses in wealth for equity holders of the banks that go under. Those folks tend to have some muscle in Washington, and their hope is essentially to get the government to take the losses for them. Worrisomely, their interests seem to have been taken to heart by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President Obama’s top economic adviser, Larry Summers, who appear to be doing their damnedest to avoid any resolution of the crisis that involves banks owning up to their losses.",

This is an initial rendering of the project, which may change designs as it makes its way through City Hall and the Design Review Board.\nWith a unanimous vote, the City Council, in its dual role as the Housing Authority, agreed to partner with an affordable housing developer on Tuesday to build a roughly $15.5-million project that will give preference to veterans.\n“It's a great day for Glendale,” said Mayor Frank Quintero, a Vietnam War veteran.\nThe site at 327-331 W. Salem St. was set to become Central City Lights, a 36-unit project by Advanced Development and Investment, Inc. But that project was canceled, and last April the city sued ADI, alleging the Los Angeles developer bilked the city of millions of dollars.\nADI had requested about $6.9 million in redevelopment and federal funding for its $15.7-million project that was to include artist live-work lofts, according to a city report.\nPATH Ventures, another Los Angeles developer, pitched a similarly sized project several months ago for the site, but city officials turned down their offer, saying they wanted more control over the property.\nInstead, the City Council approved partnering with Thomas Safran & Associates for Veterans Village on four adjoining lots comprising 27,910 square feet. The low-income, multifamily housing project will include 44 units.\nEach unit is set to range in size from about 600 to 1,100 square feet, include one-, two- and three-bedroom units and cost between $474 and $1,315 per month. The complex may also include a community room, library lounge, fitness room, computer labs and other amenities.\nDepending on the number of people in their household, future Veterans Village residents must make between $17,730 and $58,680 a year.\nThomas Safran & Associates also developed Garfield Gardens, a 30-unit complex, in 2010 at 305 E. Garfield St. Councilwoman Laura Friedman described that project as one of the best affordable housing developments in the city.\nThe preliminary project design, which still must be reviewed by city officials and the Design Review Board, includes an arts-and-crafts-style traditional design, a partial stone façade, balconies and a central clock tower.\nThe city's part of the deal will include $5.3 million in cash and land, according to a city report. Much of the city funding comes from federal grants. The developer plans to also apply for about $8 million in federal tax credits that can be sold to profitable organizations or individuals in exchange for project financing.\nAndrew Gross, principal at Thomas Safran & Associates, said the developer may be awarded the tax credits next July. Once that happens, the developer may begin construction in September. The project may be complete in early 2015",
        "baseline": ".\nThe council also entered into an agreement to develop another project that may house senior veterans.\nCommunity Development Partners is set to rehabilitate a two-story apartment building at 311 E. Cypress St. The 18-unit project is reserved for low-income seniors, but six units will be given priority preference for veterans.\nThe city plans to contribute about $1.5 million in federal grants to the roughly $4.2-million project. Community Development Partners also plans to apply for $2.4 million in tax credits to cover development costs.\nThe monthly rent will range from $448 to $961 for studios and one bedrooms and applicants must have a similar income range, depending on family size, as Veterans Village.\nThe Cypress project may be complete in about 12 months, with construction possibly beginning next March, city officials said.\nThe city is not accepting applications for both projects.

The museum has one of the world’s largest collections of cuneiform tablets from early Mesopotamia, many of them written by ancient scribes who used a reed stylus to etch pictograms into clay.\n“It really struck the world in just the right nerdy place,” said Ms. Blanchard, noting that a number of people, including home schooling parents, classroom teachers and scholars of ancient languages, had taken the idea and run with it.\nCuneiform, which is pronounced “cune-AY-uh-form” and means wedge-shaped writing, was devised by the Sumerians more than 5,000 years ago and survived until about 79 or 80 A.D. It emerged at roughly the same time as early Egyptian writing, and served as the written form of ancient tongues like Akkadian and Sumerian, which thrived in what is now southern Iraq. Because cuneiform was written in clay (rather than, say, on papyrus) and important texts were baked for posterity, a good amount of it survives today.\nSchoolchildren who visit the Penn Museum get to try their hand. “The deepest part of every symbol is the upper left, because that’s where you start with your reed, and then you just swirl it around,” Ms. Blanchard said.\nAncient schoolchildren did the same thing, and some of their efforts are on view at the museum, written on hand-held practice tablets. “There’s like a first-day tablet, where you can see someone practice the first wedge over and over and over again, like I practiced an ‘A’ in school,” Ms. Blanchard said.\nMs. Blanchard’s title at the museum is “keeper,” which involves caring for the artifacts in the Near Eastern collections and helping visiting researchers and scholars find the right items to advance their work. “It’s a combination of putting small things in boxes and knowing where jars of dirt came from,” as she put it once in an interview. The cuneiform tablets are in the Babylonian collection, which is not in her purview, but they inspired her nonetheless.\nIt was a holiday party several years ago that prompted Ms. Blanchard to contemplate the similarities between clay tablets and cookie dough. She has been making cuneiform cookies annually ever since, usually for the same holiday party. “Last year, I tried to make a brownie ziggurat,” modeled on an ancient temple, “but it did not go over as well,” she said.\nAlthough Ms. Blanchard surmises that shortbread might also be a good medium for cuneiform, it was the gingerbread that went viral, inspiring copycats online.\nInspired by Ms. Blanchard’s cuneiform cookies, Esther Brownsmith, a Ph.D. student in the Bible and Near East program at Brandeis University who has been studying Akkadian for years, went all out: For a New Year’s party, she baked four tablets of gingerbread, each on a 13-by-18-inch pan, and copied part of the Enuma Elish, a seven-tablet Babylonian creation myth, onto them. A stunning step-by-step description of this feat has drawn thousands of “likes” on her Tumblr blog.\nMs. Brownsmith said a friend emailed her a link to",
        "baseline": " the Penn publicist’s article about Ms. Blanchard’s cookies. “My first thought upon seeing her how-to was, ‘Oh my God, this is completely brilliant and completely my thing,’” Ms. Brownsmith said in an email interview.\nAt the time, she was studying the Enuma Elish for an Akkadian exam, so the tablets she baked — each of which took her about half an hour to inscribe — counted as homework.\nNow that she is teaching freshmen, Ms. Brownsmith has assigned (in English) one of the two best-known texts written in cuneiform: the Epic of Gilgamesh. (The other is the Code of Hammurabi.) Gilgamesh was a mighty king from the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, the name of which is thought to have morphed into Iraq. And Ms. Brownsmith has translated part of the epic into snacks.",

However, investors need to be aware of the avenue of direct exposure in bonds, for the sake of wider choice.\nThe biggest drawback of the direct bond route is lack of liquidity in the secondary market. This problem is, however, not there in one segment of the bond market: Tax-free PSU bonds. These bonds are rated top notch, i.e., AAA, and have implicit government support.\nThe interest payments on these bonds are free of tax, but there would be capital gains tax if you sell before maturity at a profit. The method for dealing in these bonds is similar to that of dealing in equity shares: You have to have the basic set-up with your stock broker. These bonds are listed in the capital market segment of exchanges, and hence can be dealt with in a manner similar to that of equity stocks.\nReturns on these bonds are attractive, even at current levels after a rally and yields having come down from higher levels earlier. In market parlance, the yield is referred to as YTM, which stands for yield to maturity. In simple terms, the yield is the return you would get, if you hold the bond till maturity, expressed as compound annualised interest rate. The YTM on tax-free PSU bonds currently is around 6.1%.\nThe proper perspective to look at the yield on tax-free bonds is the ‘pre-tax equivalent’ and compare it with a taxable instrument, though technically it is tax-free. Taking the tax-free bond yield at say 6.1% and the tax rate at 30.9%, the pre-tax equivalent comes to 6.1% / (1-30.9%) = 8.83%. The yields available in the market for taxable AAA rated PSU bonds is much lower than 8.83%, hence it makes sense to buy these bonds.\nThe other option is taxable PSU bonds / private sector bonds / bonds rated AAA or lower. Primary issuances of bonds happen from time to time as issuers access the market for raising resources, and you can purchase these for relatively small amounts as well.\nIt is advisable to go with higher rated bonds, AAA or at least AA, to reduce the",

The issue of liquidity becomes relevant again: If you want to sell in the secondary market before maturity, while it is possible to sell, liquidity in instruments rated less than AAA is on the lower side.

It is possible to trade relatively small quantums as well, for instance, when a desperate seller is on the exchange, offering a high YTM to encash his holding. However, to take advantage of such offerings, you need to actively track the website of the exchange and need guidance from your debt broker.\nYou may purchase tax-free AAA rated PSU bonds from the secondary market, as these issuers are not coming with primary issuances as of now, and subscribe to primary issuances of AAA / AA rated issuers, preferably for a tenure matching your cash flow requirements.",

Few countries have managed to match the returns of the S&P 500 in the U.S., due to a combination of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, along with a strong U.S. dollar against many major foreign currencies. For investors in exchange-traded funds, finding single-country ETFs with positive returns has been a challenge.\nHowever, there are a few countries that have managed to thrive even in a difficult environment. Let's take a closer look at iShares MSCI Israel (NYSEMKT:EIS), Global X MSCI Norway (NYSEMKT:NORW), and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (NYSEMKT:KSA), which are the best performers so far this year among single-country ETFs with more than $100 million in assets under management.\nData source: ETFdb.com. As of Sept. 18.\nWhat's notable about this list of three single-country ETFs is that two of the most important economies in the Middle East are represented. The Israel ETF tops the list, and although a 13% gain might not seem like much, it's impressive in the current environment.\nThe iShares ETF shows the breadth of Israel's economy. Two companies that are well-known to U.S. investors, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Check Point Software Technologies, dominate the fund, combining to make up almost 30% of the ETF's assets. But you'll also find some high-flying smaller technology players, along with exposure to Israel financial institutions and a host of other sectors. With the tech boom lifting stocks across the globe, Israel has benefited greatly from its outsized exposure to the industry.\nFarther south, the Saudi Arabia ETF is even more surprising to investors because of its almost complete lack of direct exposure to the energy sector. Most of the kingdom's energy enterprises are state-owned and unavailable to investors. Instead, three-quarters of the fund's assets are invested in financials and materials stocks, with powerhouses Saudi Basic Industries and Al Rajhi Bank having 16% and 12% allocations within the ETF, respectively. Obviously, banking institutions have substantial indirect exposure to energy, but Saudi Arabia has also worked hard to try to diversify its economic exposure and find ways to plan for a future in which its vast oil resources will be depleted.\nFar from the warm waters of the Mediterranean and Red Seas, Norway has also managed to buck the trend toward poor-performing stock markets in 2018.

If no plan is found worthy of acceptance, the assets shall go into liquidation, it ruled.\nThe court noticed that both ArcelorMittal and Numetal were technically ineligible to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, because of their links to entities that had defaulted on payments.\nBut a bench of Justices RF Nariman and Indu Malhotra invoked its extraordinary powers to give them two weeks to pay up the dues and resubmit bids.\nSection 29A of the code bars promoters of defaulting companies or related parties, and connected people from bidding for stressed assets unless they have paid their dues.\nArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, was a promoter of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, which together owed Rs 7,000 crore to banks in India and defaulted on payments. Numetal, led by Russia’s VTB Bank, had a member of Essar Steel’s promoter family, Rewant Ruia, as an investor when it made an initial bid. Essar Steel has outstanding debt of more than Rs 37,000 crore.\nArcelorMittal said it had exited the defaulting companies, claiming that this allowed it to make an offer. Nevertheless, it offered to pay off the dues if it was allowed to bid. Numetal argued that it was an independent entity with no ties to Essar Steel promoters, and therefore the Ruia family’s liabilities couldn’t be fastened on it.\nThe court refused to accept the arguments. “We… hold that, whether the first or second resolution plan is taken into account, both would clearly be hit by Section 29A(c), as the looming presence of Rewant Ruia has been found all along, from the date of incorporation of Numetal till the date of submission of the second resolution plan,” the bench said.\n“It is absolutely clear that LN Mittal, who is the ultimate shareholder of the resolution applicant, viz. AMIPL (ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd), is directly the ultimate shareholder of AMNLBV (ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV, which had invested in Uttam Galva and KSS Petron) as well, which is an LN Mittal Group company. When the corporate veil of the various companies … is pierced, both AMIPL and AMNLBV are found to be managed and controlled by LN Mittal, and are therefore persons deemed to be acting in concert…,”",
        "baseline": " it said.\nThe bench clarified Section 29A saying that apart from repaying dues, the Act did not stipulate any other mode to become eligible, including by selling shares and thereby existing as a member of a company whose account had been classified as nonperforming.\nArcelorMittal had offered Rs 42,000 crore for Essar Steel, while Numetal had said it would match the rival offer provided the Ruia family’s liabilities weren’t tied to it. In a far-reaching judgement on the Insolvency and Resolution Code, the court also clarified that the resolution process could not be challenged before the committee of creditors finalises a resolution plan.\nThe only exception would be on Section 29A, which bars any defaulting promoters or connected persons from bidding for ailing companies facing resolution.\nThe bench said the 270-day window for closing a resolution plan would exclude any litigation in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal or the Supreme Court.",

The best, surest, fastest, most effective and honest way to a flat belly for men includes a combination of aerobic exercise, core strengthening, a healthy diet and overall strength training.\nTo get a flat stomach you need to lose the flab, and that means aerobic exercise to burn it off. At a minimum, you need 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity five days a week but should shoot for closer to 60 minutes to lose the weight and flatten the stomach. Of course, if you up the intensity you can cut your workout time in half. Take a brisk walk, go for a run or do laps in the pool, whatever exercise you enjoy that gets your heart rate pumping.\nWhen you want a flat stomach, you need to think about your entire midsection, which includes not only your ab muscles but also your lower back and pelvic muscles. This area of your body is referred to as the core. You may consider it just for women, but if you want to work out your core and improve the look of your abs, sign up for Pilates. Pilates works to strengthen and lengthen all the muscles in your midsection. You can also work out your core with various floor exercises such as the reverse or bicycle crunch, the plank -- both front and side -- and pelvic tilts.\nThe ab diet isn't any different from any other diet that helps you lose weight.

You also want to replace your high saturated fat man-foods, such as cheeseburgers, bacon and butter, with foods rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as salmon, peanuts and olive oil. Watch calories if you want flatter abs. Use smaller plates, cups and bowls to help control portions.\nWhen trying to flatten your stomach, you don't want to limit your resistance training to your abs; you also want to include whole-body muscle-building exercises two to three days a week to balance your workout and body strength. Choose eight to 10 exercises that work out your major muscle groups, including chest, legs, hips, back and arms and do one set of eight to 12 reps using weight heavy enough to tire out your muscles on the last rep. In addition to making you leaner and stronger, the added muscle increases metabolism and helps burn more fat.",

    {
        "prompt": "Many of the greatest brands in the world share synonymous character traits - they are brave, irreverent, unapologetic, and the majority have a sense of humour.\nMost importantly, they innovate, the master currency of differentiation.\nThink Apple, Starbucks, Nespresso, Nike, or Virgin. You'll have a list of your own that spring to mind, but ultimately re-writing the script is what they do best. And in a market that is divided into leaders and followers, for every one of those brands, we can cite dozens of their competitors who try in vain to replicate them.\nThe world is rich in extraordinary travel brands, each seeking to earn their own corner of the market - opulence, decor, modernity, adventure, or eco-tourism, to name a few. But the last decade has seen a new breed of disruptors across all industries, those who understand a new set of savvy and discerning consumers who hold higher expectations, and a voracious appetite for novelty and surprise.\nSouth Africans that \"do the Mauritius thing\" are familiar with the white sandy beaches, swaying palm trees, water sports, and endless buffet evenings. And resorts wrestle over the quality of these primary features. But in such a competitive space how often does one encounter something really new, pioneering, disruptive perhaps?\nLUX* Resorts & Hotels is making a big play across the Indian Ocean, one of the fastest growing brands in the region. And it's a rapidly evolving space with literally dozens of well-known hotels undergoing overhauls in the past five years.\nAnd although the white, bright and light rooms from globally renowned designer, Kelly Hoppen, have often been the talking point, it is now the creative liberty of the brand which is stealing more of the limelight.\nIts CEO, Paul Jones, formerly of One&Only is fixated on the element of surprise and innovation at memorable touch-points in the resort - the reason why I found my sunglasses resting on a square cleaning cloth in my room, my name sewn into my gown, a happy birthday pillow on the bed for my wife with a small bag of gifts, or even a towel wrapped in the shape of a cake with rose petals as decoration.\nYes, absolutely, LUX* Belle Mare's heated pool (at 2,000 square metres) is the largest on the island, and the beach is arguably the best (according to the locals). The guys at the boathouse were patient and humorous and instructed my daughter with real care to get her on waterskis, but that's a standard that LUX* seems to expect as a foundation, a canvas to work from.\nThe colours that make a splash are things like the Mari Kontan thatched rum bar, their own craft microbrewery, the K-Bar next to the pool, or its own coffee shop, Cafe LUX*, which roasts its own beans and allows guests to participate in a roastery tour at the resort. A stone's throw away, there is the tiny Tea",
        "baseline": " House where you can sample any one of 88 oriental teas in glass infusers, and then settle into a new library and wingback armchairs in silence.\nAdjacent is a world-class spa, merchandised like a parfumerie you would find in London's Knightsbridge, or stairs which will take you to a gym with the latest equipment, and a new set of Pilates machines to fight the buffet belly under the tutorials of trained instructors.\nThe kids, of course, have the Kids Club, table-tennis, pool table, jungle gym and tennis courts but so do the majority of premium resorts. It was Junk Art which caught our attention next door, an art studio devoted to arts and crafts - but only using recycled materials - so the kids made cardboard cameras, musical instruments, and even a fidget spinner. The only issue with Junk Art was trying to get the kids out of there - they stayed two and a half hours one afternoon.",

        "prompt": "The City Council cited a lack of consensus for taking no position on a measure to require oil and gas set backs of almost half a mile from developments.\nThe oil and gas industry doesn't have the backing of the Fort Collins City Council this November.\nThe council abstained Tuesday night from taking a position on Proposition 112, a ballot measure that would prohibit oil and gas wells from going in within 2,500 feet of homes, schools, hospitals, parks, open spaces, waterways and more. Council members lacked consensus on the measure. The council typically takes positions on statewide issues only if there is unanimity.\n\"This is a discussion of competing values,\" council member Ross Cunniff said. \"I think it's up to the voters to decide how they want to weigh in on this one.\"\nThe council's legislative review committee recommended formal opposition to the measure. The full council's vote is just a show of support, neutrality or opposition to statewide measures.\nCompeting rallies gathered in front of City Hall before the meeting, with a pro-112 group at the main entry. Anti-112 activists grouped together along Laporte Avenue and the parking lot. But once inside the council chambers, the public commenting was decidedly pro-112, with about 22 people supporting the half-mile setbacks and about seven opposing them.\n\"I think it would have been better if (council members) all wanted to support 112,\" but abstention also works, Kevin Cross of the Fort Collins Sustainability Group said after the vote. He was dismissive about the negative effects of the setbacks. Horizontal drilling is economically viable from greater than 2,500 feet and the industry's employment base in the state is overstated, he argued.\nCouncil member Ken Summers most vocally opposed the measure from the council and warned a downturn would hurt Fort Collins by way of its neighbors in Weld County, one of the heaviest oil-and-gas-producing counties in the country.\n\"We don't put fences around Weld County to keep all the oil and gas workers in Weld County and keep them out of Fort Collins,\" he said, noting many Fort Collins residents and people who come to the Choice City for fun work in the industry.\nHe added, \"The oil and gas industry is not some monolithic evil empire. It's a lot of small businesses that are endeavoring to work and raise families and just to do what every American desires to do in terms of enjoying a quality of life, having an income and a job.\"\nThe City Council in August approved a setback for new developments that prevented them from being built within 500 feet of an existing oil and gas well, which is extended to 1,000 feet for high-occupancy buildings. However, that ordinance incentivized the capping and monitoring of wells by lowering the setbacks for new developments to 150 feet if they meet a set of environmental requirements, potentially opening up land for",
        "baseline": " new homes.\nThe council also narrowly voted in May to support a lawsuit, Martinez v. Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, that seeks to bar Colorado oil and gas drilling that could impact human health and contribute to climate change.\nMeanwhile the council voted to support Proposition 110, a sales tax for transportation, but opposed another measure, Proposition 109, that would pay for it with existing state money. Council member Gerry Horak warned that Prop 109 would sap limited money from other state needs, such as education.\nProposition 110 raises the state sales tax by 0.62 percentage points, or 62 cents on $100 spent on applicable goods, but would funnel the bonded $6 billion into state projects, city and county projects and multimodal projects.\nThe council also formally opposed Amendment 74, which would hold state and local governments liable if laws or regulations cause private property to lose value — a proposal opponents warn would lead to a flood of lawsuits against tax-funded entities because of unclear wording.",

Volunteers do patrols at night to help the toads cross the road safely without being killed by motorists. There is also a barrier system on some of the main roads with buckets to catch the toads which are then carried across the road to a nearby pond.\nJ’kul said some nights it was tough going out in the rain.\nShe said the beginning of breeding season was usually mid- to late-July coinciding with the first rains and often a full moon.\nThis year it was on July 20 and when volunteers went out in the Silvermine area they found 19 live toads and 12 dead ones.\nThen,",

They then alert the other volunteers that they are on the move.\nWhile in amplexus (mating), the male holds on to the female's back for up to two weeks until she drops her eggs.\nWhy go out in the rain at night to save a toad? “Until people have had a one-on-one experience with an animal they don't get it.

        "prompt": "Revelations from WikiLeaks published this week show how boundlessly and comprehensively American intelligence services spied on the German government. It has now emerged that the US also conducted surveillance against SPIEGEL.\nDER SPIEGEL's headquarters in Hamburg, Germany: The newsmagazine filed a complaint Friday with the country's federal prosecutor after discovering it had been US spying target.\nWalks during working hours aren't the kind of pastime one would normally expect from a leading official in the German Chancellery. Especially not from the head of Department Six, the official inside Angela Merkel's office responsible for coordinating Germany's intelligence services.\nBut in the summer of 2011, Günter Heiss found himself stretching his legs for professional reasons. The CIA's station chief in Berlin had requested a private conversation with Heiss. And he didn't want to meet in an office or follow standard protocol. Instead, he opted for the kind of clandestine meeting you might see in a spy film.\nOfficially, the CIA man was accredited as a counsellor with the US Embassy, located next to Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate. Married to a European, he had already been stationed in Germany once before and knew how to communicate with German officials. At times he could be demanding and overbearing, but he could also be polite and courteous. During this summer walk he also had something tangible to offer Heiss.\nThe CIA staffer revealed that a high-ranking Chancellery official allegedly maintained close contacts with the media and was sharing official information with reporters with SPIEGEL.\nThe American provided the name of the staffer: Hans Josef Vorbeck, Heiss' deputy in Department Six. The information must have made it clear to Heiss that the US was spying on the German government as well as the press that reports on it.\nThe central Berlin stroll remained a secret for almost four years. The Chancellery quietly transferred Vorbeck, who had until then been responsible for counterterrorism, to another, less important department responsible dealing with the history of the BND federal intelligence agency. Other than that, though, it did nothing.\nOfficials in the Chancellery weren't interested in how the CIA had obtained its alleged information. They didn't care to find out how, and to which degree, they were being spied on by the United States. Nor were they interested in learning about the degree to which SPIEGEL was being snooped on by the Americans. Chancellery officials didn't contact any of the people in question. They didn't contact members of the Bundestag federal parliament sitting on the Parliamentary Control Panel, the group responsible for oversight of the intelligence services. They didn't inform members of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the agency responsible for counterintelligence in Germany, either. And they didn't contact a single public prosecutor. Angela Merkel's office, it turns out, simply made a farce of the rule of law.\nAs a target of the surveillance, SPIEGEL has requested more information from the Chancellery. At the same time, the magazine filed a complaint on Friday with the Federal Public Prosecutor due to suspicion of intelligence agency activity.\nBecause now, in the course of the proceedings of the parliamentary investigative committee probing the NSA's activities in Germany in the wake of revelations leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, details about the event that took place in the summer of 2011 are gradually leaking to the public. At the beginning of May, the mass-circulation tabloid Bild am Sonntag reported on a Chancellery official who had been sidelined \"in the wake of evidence of alleged betrayal of secrets through US secret services.\"\nResearch conducted by SPIEGEL has determined the existence of CIA and NSA files filled with a large number of memos pertaining to the work of the German newsmagazine. And three different government sources in Berlin and Washington have independently confirmed that the CIA station chief in Berlin was referring specifically to Vorbeck's contacts with SPIEGEL.\nAn Operation Justified by Security Interests?\nObama administration sources with knowledge of the operation said that it was justified by American security interests. The sources said US intelligence services had determined the existence of intensive contacts between SPIEGEL reporters and the German government and decided to intervene because those communications were viewed as damaging to the United States' interests. The fact that the CIA and NSA were prepared to reveal an ongoing surveillance operation to the Chancellery underlines the importance they attached to the leaks, say sources in Washington. The NSA, the sources say, were aware that the German government would know from then on that the US was spying in Berlin.\nAs more details emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that representatives of the German government at best looked away as the Americans violated the law, and at worst supported them.\nJust last Thursday, Günter Heiss and his former supervisor, Merkel's former Chief of Staff Ronald Pofalla, were questioned by the parliamentary investigative committee and attempted to explain the egregious activity. Heiss confirmed that tips had been given, but claimed they hadn't been \"concrete enough\" for measures to be taken. When asked if he had been familiar with the issue, Pofalla answered, \"Of course.\" He said that anything else he provided had to be \"in context,\" at which point a representative of the Chancellery chimed in and pointed out that could only take place in a meeting behind closed doors.\nFormer Chancellery chief Ronald Pofalla during questioning before the parliamentary committee investigating the NSA affair in Berlin. \"Of course\" he had been familiar with the issue, the former senior Merkel staffer said.\nIn that sense, the meeting of the investigative committee once again shed light on the extent to which the balance of power has shifted between the government and the Fourth Estate. Journalists, who scrutinize and criticize those who govern, are an elementary part of the \"checks and balances\" -- an American invention -- aimed at ensuring both transparency and accountability. When it comes to intelligence issues, however, it appears this system has been out of balance for some time.\nWhen SPIEGEL first reported in Summer 2013 about the extent of NSA's spying on Germany, German politicians first expressed shock and then a certain amount of indignation before quickly sliding back into their persona as a loyal ally. After only a short time and a complete lack of willingness on the part of the Americans to explain their actions, Pofalla declared that the \"allegations are off the table.\"\nBut a number of reports published in recent months prove that, whether out of fear, outrage or an alleged lack of knowledge, it was all untrue. Everything the government said was a lie. As far back as 2013, the German government was in a position to suspect, if not to know outright, the obscene extent to which the United States was spying on an ally. If there hadn't already been sufficient evidence of the depth of the Americans' interest in what was happening in Berlin, Wednesday's revelations by WikiLeaks, in cooperation with Süddeutsche Zeitung, filled in the gaps.\nSPIEGEL's reporting has long been a thorn in the side of the US administration. In addition to its reporting on a number of other scandals, the magazine exposed the kidnapping of Murat Kurnaz, a man of Turkish origin raised in Bremen, Germany, and his rendition to Guantanamo. It exposed the story of Mohammed Haydar Zammar, who was taken to Syria, where he was tortured. The reports triggered the launch of a parliamentary investigative committee in Berlin to look also into the CIA's practices.\nWhen SPIEGEL reported extensively on the events surrounding the arrest of three Islamist terrorists in the so-called \"Sauerland cell\" in Germany, as well as the roles played by the CIA and the NSA in foiling the group, the US government complained several times about the magazine. In December 2007, US intelligence coordinator Mike McConnell personally raised the issue during a visit to Berlin. And when SPIEGEL reported during the summer of 2009, under the headline \"Codename Domino,\" that a group of al-Qaida supporters was believed to be heading for Europe, officials at the CIA seethed. The sourcing included a number of security agencies and even a piece of information supplied by the Americans. At the time, the station chief for Germany's BND intelligence service stationed in Washington was summoned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\nThe situation escalated in August 2010 after SPIEGEL, together with WikiLeaks, the Guardian and the New York Times, began exposing classified US Army reports from Afghanistan. That was followed three months later with the publication of the Iraq war logs based on US Army reports. And in November of that year, WikiLeaks, SPIEGEL and several international media reported how the US government thinks internally about the rest of the world on the basis of classified State Department cables. Pentagon officials at the time declared that WikiLeaks had \"blood on its hands.\" The Justice Department opened an investigation and seized data from Twitter accounts, e-mail exchanges and personal data from activists connected with the whistleblowing platform. The government then set up a Task Force with the involvement of the CIA and NSA.\nNot even six months later, the CIA station chief requested to go on the walk in which he informed the intelligence coordinator about Vorbeck and harshly criticized SPIEGEL.\nNot long later, a small circle inside the Chancellery began discussing how the CIA may have got ahold of the information. Essentially, two possibilities were conceivable: either through an informant or through surveillance of communications. But how likely is it that the CIA had managed to recruit a source in the Chancellery or on the editorial staff of SPIEGEL?\nThe more likely answer, members of the circle concluded, was that the information must have been the product of \"SigInt,\" signals intelligence -- in other words, wiretapped communications. It seems fitting that during the summer of 2013, just prior to the scandal surrounding Edward Snowden and the documents he exposed pertaining to NSA spying, German government employees warned several SPIEGEL journalists that the Americans were eavesdropping on them.\nAt the end of June 2011, Heiss then flew to Washington. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, the issue of the alleged contact with SPIEGEL was raised again. Chancellery staff noted the suspicion in a classified internal memo that explicitly names SPIEGEL.\nChancellor Merkel's former intelligence coordinator Günter Heiss has claimed that information provided by the CIA wasn't \"concrete\" enough for the German government to take action.\nOne of the great ironies of the story is that contact with the media was one of Vorbeck's job responsibilities. He often took part in background discussions with journalists and even represented the Chancellery at public events. \"I had contact with journalists and made no secret about it,\" Vorbeck told SPIEGEL. \"I even received them in my office in the Chancellery. That was a known fact.\" He has since hired a lawyer.\nIt remains unclear just who US intelligence originally had in its scopes. The question is also unlikely to be answered by the parliamentary investigative committee, because the US appears to have withheld this information from the Chancellery. Theoretically, at least, there are three possibilities: The Chancellery -- at least in the person of Hans Josef Vorbeck. SPIEGEL journalists. Or blanket surveillance of Berlin's entire government quarter. The NSA is capable of any of the three options. And it is important to note that each of these acts would represent a violation of German law.\nSo far, the Chancellery has barricaded itself behind the argument that the origin of the information had been too vague and abstract to act on. In addition, the tip had been given in confidentiality, meaning that neither Vorbeck nor SPIEGEL could be informed. But both are weak arguments, given that the CIA station chief's allegations were directed precisely at SPIEGEL and Vorbeck and that the intelligence coordinator's deputy would ultimately be sidelined as a result.\nAnd even if you follow the logic that the tip wasn't concrete enough, there is still one committee to whom the case should have been presented under German law: the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control Panel, whose proceedings are classified and which is responsible for oversight of Germany's intelligence services. The nine members of parliament on the panel are required to be informed about all intelligence events of \"considerable importance.\"\nMembers of parliament on the panel did indeed express considerable interest in the Vorbeck case. They learned in fall 2011 of his transfer, and wanted to know why \"a reliable coordinator in the fight against terrorism would be shifted to a post like that, one who had delivered excellent work on the issue,\" as then chairman of the panel, Social Demoratic Party politician Thomas Oppermann, criticized at the time.\nBut no word was mentioned about the reasons behind the transfer during a Nov. 9, 2011 meeting of the panel. Not a single word about the walk taken by the CIA chief of station. Not a word about the business trip to Washington taken by Günter Heiss afterward. And not a word about Vorbeck's alleged contacts with SPIEGEL. Instead, the parliamentarians were told a myth -- that the move had been made necessary by cutbacks. And also because he was needed to work on an historical appraisal of Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND.\nOfficials in the Chancellery had decided to deceive parliament about the issue. And for a long time, it looked as though they would get away with it.\nThe appropriate way of dealing with the CIA's incrimination would have been to transfer the case to the justice system. Public prosecutors would have been forced to follow up with two investigations: One to find out whether the CIA's allegations against Vorbeck had been true -- both to determine whether government secrets had been breached and out of the obligation to assist a longtime civil servant. It also would have had to probe suspicions that a foreign intelligence agency conducted espionage in the heart of the German capital.\nThat could, and should, have been the case. Instead, the Chancellery decided to go down the path of deception, scheming with an ally, all the while interpreting words like friendship and partnership in a highly arbitrary and scrupulous way.\nGünter Heiss, who received the tip from the CIA station chief, is an experienced civil servant. In his earlier years, Heiss studied music. He would go on as a music instructor to teach a young Ursula von der Leyen (who is Germany's defense minister today) how to play the piano. But then Heiss, a tall, slightly lanky man, switched professions and instead pursued a career in intelligence that would lead him to the top post in the Lower Saxony state branch of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Even back then, the Christian Democrat was already covering up the camera on his laptop screen with tape. At the very least \"they\" shouldn't be able to see him, he said at the time, elaborating that the \"they\" he was referring to should not be interpreted as being the US intelligence services, but rather the other spies - \"the Chinese\" and, \"in any case, the Russians.\" For conservatives like Heiss, America, after all, is friendly territory.\nIf there was suspicion in the summer of 2011 that the NSA was spying on a staff member at the Chancellery, it should have set off alarm bells within the German security apparatus. Both the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which is responsible for counter-intelligence, and the Federal Office for Information Security should have been informed so that they could intervene. There also should have been discussions between the government ministers and the chancellor in order to raise government awareness about the issue. And, going by the maxim the chancellor would formulate two years later, Merkel should have had a word with the Americans along the lines of \"Spying among friends is not acceptable.\"\nIf it is true that a foreign intelligence agency spied on journalists as they conducted their reporting in Germany and then informed the Chancellery about it, then these actions would place a huge question mark over the notion of a free press in this country. Germany's highest court ruled in 2007 that press freedom is a \"constituent part of a free and democratic order.\" The court held that reporting can no longer be considered free if it entails a risk that journalists will be spied on during their reporting and that the federal government will be informed of the people they speak to.\n\"Freedom of the press also offers protection from the intrusion of the state in the confidentiality of the editorial process as well as the relationship of confidentiality between the media and its informants,\" the court wrote in its ruling. Freedom of the press also provides special protection to the \"the secrecy of sources of information and the relationship of confidentiality between the press, including broadcasters, and the source.\"\nBut Karlsruhe isn't Washington. And freedom of the press is not a value that gives American intelligence agencies pause. On the contrary, the Obama administration has gained a reputation for adamantly pursuing uncomfortable journalistic sources. It hasn't even shied away from targeting American media giants.\nIn spring 2013, it became known that the US Department of Justice mandated the monitoring of 100 telephone numbers belonging to the news agency Associated Press. Based on the connections that had been tapped, AP was able to determine that the government likely was interested in determining the identity of an important informant. The source had revealed to AP reporters details of a CIA operation pertaining to an alleged plot to blow up a commercial jet.\nThe head of AP wasn't the only one who found the mass surveillance of his employees to be an \"unconstitutional act.\" Even Republican Senators like John Boehner sharply criticized the government, pointing to press freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. \"The First Amendment is first for a reason,\" he said.\nBut the Justice Department is unimpressed by such formulations. New York Times reporter James Risen, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, was threatened with imprisonment for contempt of court in an effort to get him to turn over his sources -- which he categorically refused to do for seven years. Ultimately, public pressure became too intense, leading Obama's long-time Attorney General Eric Holder to announce last October that Risen would not be forced to testify.\nThe Justice Department was even more aggressive in its pursuit of James Rosen, the Washington bureau chief for TV broadcaster Fox. In May 2013, it was revealed that his telephone was bugged, his emails were read and his visits to the State Department were monitored. To obtain the necessary warrants, the Justice Department had labeled Rosen a \"criminal co-conspirator.\"\nThe strategy of criminalizing journalism has become something of a bad habit under Obama's leadership, with his government pursuing non-traditional media, such as the whistleblower platform WikiLeaks, with particular aggression.\nBradley Manning, who supplied WikiLeaks with perhaps its most important data dump, was placed in solitary confinement and tormented with torture-like methods, as the United Nations noted critically. Manning is currently undergoing a gender transition and now calls herself Chelsea. In 2013, a military court sentenced Manning, who, among other things, publicized war crimes committed by the US in Iraq, to 35 years in prison.\nIn addition, a criminal investigation has been underway for at least the last five years into the platform's operators, first and foremost its founder Julian Assange. For the past several years, a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia has been working to determine if charges should be brought against the organization.\nThe proceedings are hidden from the public, but the grand jury's existence became apparent once it began to subpoena witnesses with connections to WikiLeaks and when the Justice Department sought to confiscate data belonging to people who worked with Assange. The US government, for example, demanded that Twitter hand over data pertaining to several people, including the Icelandic parliamentarian Brigitta Jonsdottir, who had worked with WikiLeaks on the production of a video. The short documentary is an exemplary piece of investigative journalism, showing how a group of civilians, including employees of the news agency Reuters, were shot and killed in Baghdad by an American Apache helicopter.\nComputer security expert Jacob Appelbaum, who occasionally freelances for SPIEGEL, was also affected at the time. Furthermore, just last week he received material from Google showing that the company too had been forced by the US government to hand over information about him - for the time period from November 2009 until today. The order would seem to indicate that investigators were particularly interested in Appelbaum's role in the publication of diplomatic dispatches by WikiLeaks.\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has referred to journalists who worked with material provided by Edward Snowden has his \"accomplices.\" In the US, there are efforts underway to pass a law pertaining to so-called \"media leaks.\" Australia already passed one last year. Pursuant to the law, anyone who reveals details about secret service operations may be punished, including journalists.\nThe German government isn't too far from such positions either. That has become clear with its handling of the strictly classified list of \"selectors,\" which is held in the Chancellery. The list includes search terms that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, used when monitoring telecommunications data on behalf of the NSA. The parliamentary investigative committee looking into NSA activity in Germany has thus far been denied access to the list. The Chancellery is concerned that allowing the committee to review the list could result in uncomfortable information making its way into the public.\nThe roof of the US Embassy in Berlin appears in the foreground, with the cupola of the German parliament building, the Reichstag, in the background. It is believed the US conducted esponiage from its Berlin Embassy.\nThat's something Berlin would like to prevent. Despite an unending series of indignities visited upon Germany by US intelligence agencies, the German government continues to believe that it has a \"special\" relationship with its partners in America -- and is apparently afraid of nothing so much as losing this partnership.\nThat, at least, seems to be the message of a five-page secret letter sent by Chancellery Chief of Staff Peter Altmaier, of Merkel's Christian Democrats, to various parliamentary bodies charged with oversight. In the June 17 missive, Altmaier warns of a \"grave loss of trust\" should German lawmakers be given access to the list of NSA spying targets. Opposition parliamentarians have interpreted the letter as a \"declaration of servility\" to the US.\nAltmaier refers in the letter to a declaration issued by the BND on April 30. It notes that the spying targets passed on by the NSA since 2005 include \"European political personalities, agencies in EU member states, especially ministries and EU institutions, and representations of certain companies.\" On the basis of this declaration, Altmaier writes, \"the investigative committee can undertake its own analysis, even without knowing the individual selectors.\"\nCommittee members have their doubts. They suspect that the BND already knew at the end of April what WikiLeaks has now released -- with its revelations that the German Economics Ministry, Finance Ministry and Agriculture Ministry were all under the gaze of the NSA, among other targets. That would mean that the formulation in the BND declaration of April 30 was intentionally misleading. The Left Party and the Greens now intend to gain direct access to the selector list by way of a complaint to Germany's Constitutional Court.\nThe government in Berlin would like to prevent exactly that. The fact that the US and German intelligence agencies shared selectors is \"not a matter of course. Rather, it is a procedure that requires, and indicates, a special degree of trust,\" Almaier writes. Should the government simply hand over the lists, Washington would see that as a \"profound violation of confidentiality requirements.\" One could expect, he writes, that the \"US side would significantly restrict its cooperation on security issues, because it would no longer see its German partners as sufficiently trustworthy.\"\nAltmaier's letter neglects to mention the myriad NSA violations committed against German interests, German citizens and German media.\n1. Do they also stop, or alter, Emails from readers?\nFor me, this is no surprise, the Spiegel brings a form of journalism which is too near to the truth for most nationalist governments. Although the (by name), Democratic party in the USA is more moderate and social, than the Republicans are, it is still handles in a way which could be compared with the most extreme radical national and religious governments around our globe. It would seem that America has accepted many ideas and methods. which in the last century were used by Stalin, Hitler, Benes and General Wadislaw Sikorski. Perhaps we should refer to these agencies as secret-, rather than intelligence services.\nNot Mrs. Merkel failed but the Greek state failed because one cannot spend more than one makes without going bankrupt.\nThe Merkel government and German banks' attempt at destroying Greece, and enacting a de facto anti-democratic coup",

This is not \"national security\". This is economic espionage for the benefit of the financial elite. The NSA actions are not even remotely in keeping with its \"national security\" mandate. Yet another reason for the NSA's fear of exposure in the German press.\nI have no illusions about the deeply corrupt American State. It is no longer a reflection of the American nation.

They had an unbelievable amount of people working out there; all kinds of friends and people from around other beaches.\"\n\"Everybody was pitching in to help them (residents) make it through the day,\" Watts said. \"It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just helps out.\"\nAccording to provincial Emergency Measures Organization officials, a total of seven permanent homes were literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes from Lake Dauphin around supper time on Friday, pushed by north winds gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour.\nDoug Davis had just taken a shower and was about to sit down on his couch and relax at his home along Ochre Beach on Friday night.\nThen he heard the ice coming.\n\"All of a sudden,\" said Davis’s wife, Elaine, \"that was it.\"\nWithin the next five minutes, a wall of ice rose from the lake so powerful that it plowed though the Davis’s two-storey home, pushing furniture from one bedroom into another. It pushed the bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.\nThe Davis family wasn’t alone. In all, 27 homes and cottages were damaged or destroyed – although no injuries were reported.\nA local state of emergency was declared in the municipality, and residents along the beach were evacuated on Friday night.\nThe provincial Emergency Social Services were called to the scene Friday night to assist residents in finding temporary lodging. Structural experts from the Office of the Fire Commissioner were also on hand to determine whether some residents could be allowed to attempt clean up or collect belongings. On Saturday, the residents and volunteers were allowed to return to the area and begin digging the ice on homes that were declared structurally stable.\nAll for a natural event that was over in just 15 minutes.\n\"They (homeowners) heard it before they saw it (the ice) coming up their decks,\" Watts said. \"Then it came right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt. We were very lucky.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Watts was standing on an adjacent beach, looking over the damage.\n\"The ice is up taller than the cottages and homes,\" he said. \"It kind of dwarfs them.\"\n\"This is nothing you can predict,\" Watts said. \"Water, you can see it coming up. There’s nothing you can do to prevent this. Sometimes, it’s just the luck of the way the wind is blowing. You can just hope for the best, and the best was no one got hurt.\"\nIce from Dauphin Lake smashed into this home at Ochre Beach Friday. About 23 homes were destroyed and 27 affected. No injuries were reported.\nHowever, Watts said many of the cottagers and home owners affected by the ice wave were also just recovering from severe flooding in 2011. In fact, a few of the homes were newly constructed.\n\"That’s what’s so devastating,\" he said. \"These people have rebuilt their homes and got their lives back together. Now they have to start over again.\"\nIn fact, the Davis’s were just in the process of seeking out contractors to rebuild the foundation of their home, due to lingering flood damage.\nInstead, on Saturday morning, Elaine was surveying an entirely different dilemma.\n\"We’re looking at a front room filled ice and we’re trying to shovel it out,\" she said. \"There are huge chunks. It breaks my heart to",
        "baseline": " see our house....everybody’s houses. The feeling is indescribable. She’s gone.\n\"But you salvage what you can. There’s not much a person can do. You just have to take a deep breath and do what you have to do.\"\nDavis was even more concerned about weather reports on Saturday that high winds were being predicted this weekend.\n\"Mother nature’s not done with us yet,\" she said. \"You never know.\"\nHowever, on Saturday night, the winds had begun to die down, Watts said.\nRandy Turner spent much of his journalistic career on the road. A lot of roads. Dirt roads, snow-packed roads, U.S. interstates and foreign highways. In other words, he got a lot of kilometres on the odometer, if you know what we mean.\nUpdated on Saturday, May 11, 2013 at 12:42 PM CDT: Updated, edited.",

        "prompt": "Waltrip's final race will be at Sonoma this June.\nIn his 19th season as a race analyst for Fox Sports, NASCAR Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip is set to end his broadcasting career at this June’s race at Sonoma, Fox’s final NASCAR race of the season.\nThere had been reports that the 72-year-old Waltrip was considering retirement, and that sparked a debate from those for and against the move, which spiraled out of control at times over the past few days.\nIn an exclusive conversation with Mike Organ of The Tennessean, Waltrip said he chose this Bristol race weekend as the right time and place to announce his retirement. Not only is Bristol Motor Speedway in Waltrip’s native Tennessee, it is the place where he had his biggest success, winning 12 races from 1978-92 (including seven in a row from 1981-84).\nWaltrip began his broadcasting career with Fox right after retiring as a driver. As one of the original on-air people from Fox’s first year in NASCAR, his career began in difficult fashion, calling his brother Michael (now a Fox NASCAR analyst) to his first career victory in the 2001 Daytona 500, which is more remembered for Dale Earnhardt’s fatal crash.\nEarly on, Waltrip’s reputation as an outspoken figure on the grid made him a perfect race analyst. Over the years, he combined that with a more light-hearted style, culminating with his traditional “Boogity, boogity, boogity” catchphrase before each race, which fans either seemed to love or hate. Waltrip was nominated for a Sports Emmy in 2007 for Outstanding Sports Personality.\nWaltrip told Organ there are multiple reasons why now is the right time to move onto the next chapter. Those thoughts of retirement started in 2017; Waltrip originally felt that was the right time, considering his number was 17 for a sizable portion of his career. But feeling he wasn’t quite ready to bow out, Waltrip kept going. Now, though, he’s enjoying babysitting his newborn granddaughter. And after missing out on seeing his daughters grow up, he wanted to be around more to see his granddaughter grow up.\nAnother sign that it was time for Waltrip to contemplate retirement was the insertion of Jeff Gordon to the crew. It’s nothing that Gordon or Fox, did but Waltrip noticed Gordon was more in-tune with the more modern aspects of the sport than he was because Gordon just retired. That was where many, including I, noticed that Waltrip could have been better served in another role on Fox’s NASCAR crew than being in the booth with Gordon.\nKind of like CBS with Phil Simms and Tony Romo, the athlete-turned-analyst who had been retired for 20 years can only do so much around someone fresh out of the game. CBS put Simms into the studio for Romo, who is regarded as one of the best NFL analysts out there because he just retired and knows the modern intricacies of the game as only someone who played would know. Gordon raced these cars and raced against these drivers and Waltrip didn’t. And when the two of them were in the booth at the same time, even those outside the media could notice that Gordon was able to explain some things better than Waltrip.\nTo Fox’s credit, they remained loyal to Waltrip and kept him in the booth. I, for one, had been vocal in wanting to see Waltrip in the",
        "baseline": " studio where he could interact with his brother and not be in a position where he can be directly compared to Gordon. That isn’t a slight on Waltrip, it’s just the nature of the beast as a former athlete-turned-analyst. If Romo and Gordon choose to have 20-year broadcasting careers, they aren’t going to know as much about the formations or the cars as those things evolve and some newly-retired athlete will come in and eventually be better than them.\nNow that this retirement is official, the NASCAR community can come together to wish Waltrip well as he embarks on the next chapter. Even those who may have been on the side of wanting him to bow out or didn’t care for his lighthearted broadcasting style cannot discount how important Waltrip has been to the sport over the past 45 years. This June will definitely be the end of an era in NASCAR broadcasting and his replacement will have some big shoes to fill.",

        "prompt": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking China's support on Crimea.\nAs the United States and Europe threaten Russia with trade sanctions, Moscow is looking east to Asian countries that might act as an economic bulwark.\nThe Kremlin's calculations rely heavily on China -- already the second largest importer of Russian goods and a voracious energy consumer.\nIncreased Russian reliance on China would be helped along by a thaw in relations between Moscow and Beijing in recent decades. The countries share a border, often team up on U.N. Security Council votes and frequently trade military equipment.\nShould the West pursue new sanctions to isolate Russia -- possibly in response to further incursions into Ukraine -- those ties will be put to the test. Moscow could also widen the search for support to Japan and India.\nEnergy supplies are likely to feature prominently in any shift to the East.\nRussia sends more than 7 million barrels of oil a day to the world markets, and its total energy trade earns 70% of its $515 billion in annual export revenue, according to the U.S. Energy information Administration.\nIt has long pursued a natural gas deal with China, but a final agreement between state-owned behemoths Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corp has been delayed by a disagreement over pricing.\nNow, Russia may be willing to accept a lower price in exchange for the security of having another dedicated buyer for its gas. Elsewhere in Asia, Russia could pursue additional business with South Korea and Japan, two traditional U.S. allies that are also big energy importers.\nEurope and the U.S. have imposed sanctions on top Russian officials and oligarchs, and one Russian bank, in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea. They have also warned of tougher measures to come if it destabilizes other parts of Ukraine.\nThrowing a wrench into energy markets, however, is something western countries hope to avoid given Europe's reliance on Russian gas.\nThere are signs, though, that Russia should not presume total Chinese cooperation if it is forced to pursue alternative markets for its exports.\nBeijing has",

Putin specifically thanked India -- right after China -- for \"understanding\" Russian actions in Crimea.\n\"We are grateful to the people of China, whose leaders have always considered the situation in Ukraine and Crimea taking into account the full historical and political context, and greatly appreciate India's reserve and objectivity,\" Putin said last week.",

The work was farmed out to EDS – HP's services wing and specialist hoover of government cash. It was intended to make it easier for the spooks to cope with various difficulties they face in the modern era, for instance peer-to-peer communications services such as Skype or torrents.\nThe IMP plan was widely criticised at the time, which helped stall the project until after the election.\nIt would appear that IMP is now rebranded as the \"Communications Capabilities Development Programme\".

The most notable comes in the form of a wilderness guide (Eric Balfour) who happens to come across their camp around dinner: the fish he’s happy to share seem like a remarkably less friendly gesture when he pulls out a knife damn near twice their size and guts them. The firelight conversation that follows, with the guide acting distantly mysterious and Alex’s jealousy rising, stays just on the edge of explosion, and even its end offers no relief: now there’s a weirdo out there in the woods, too.\nAs Alex and Jenn tromp towards a lake he promises will be worth it, more ill omens add up. Stepping over a bear track gives way to catching a sniff and a glimpse of a disemboweled deer; taking a marginally more overgrown path gives way to wandering through brambles that don’t seem to have been tramped down before. Alex gets both more reassuring and withholding; Jenn is both more wary and more concerned about ruining the experience for her boyfriend.\nThe psychology is at times a little simple, if not",

Sitting in the tent in the middle of the night, a gray translucent sliver is all we can see, and the uncomfortable claustrophobia that follows when Alex and Jenn’s shadows slightly obscure its edges becomes outright fear when something outside completely blacks it out. Once things firmly go to hell, the camera pulses in and out of focus, which suggests heavy breathing, a quickening heart and the confusion of terror all at once.\nThe result is 90 straight minutes of rising tension, never so much relieved as occasionally back-pedalled to take another mad run at Alex and Jenn and us.

        "prompt": "Does Trump really have ‘absolute power’ to declare a national emergency? Let’s examine the statute.\nEditors’ note: We are reposting this analysis, first published on January 10, 2019, when President Trump had suggested he might declare an emergency at the border.\nWe’ve heard a lot this week about the National Emergencies Act (NEA) of 1976, thanks to President Trump’s claim that the lack of a wall on the southern border constitutes not just a “Humanitarian and National Security crisis,” not just “a crisis of the heart and … of the soul,” but “a national emergency.” He has threatened to invoke the NEA to address that emergency — thus bypassing Congress, as well as that pesky constitutional requirement that all funds spent by the government be appropriated by the legislative branch.\nDoes the president have, as he says, “the absolute right” to do this? Well, very little about presidential power is supposed to be absolute. But the NEA can now be added to the list of statutes passed by Congress during its post-Watergate resurgence that were meant to rein in the presidency but have, in fact, empowered it.\nThe National Emergencies Act was passed in 1976 to reboot the system. It started by phasing out existing emergency powers and setting a one-year (though renewable) limit on future states of emergency. There remain more than 120 provisions in law that are on standby if needed. But under the NEA, presidents had to specify which powers, in which laws, they were activating (i.e., not all of them at once). Any ongoing emergency could be terminated at any time by Congress, which was supposed to regularly consider just that question.\nSo where do we stand? Well, as of 2019, the United States has been in a continuous state of emergency for four full decades — since 1979.\nThat particular emergency was declared by President Jimmy Carter, to freeze Iranian assets after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. It has been renewed every year since, by six other presidents. But others have been added, too, as Lawfare’s Catherine Padhi usefully documents; in fact, CNN counts 31 of them. All but two utilize powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, which allows presidents to impose financial sanctions on hostile foreign actors. Sometimes this has provided a way for presidents to unilaterally implement their policy preferences, as when President Ronald Reagan applied IEEPA sanctions against Nicaragua in 1985 as a substitute for those Congress had refused to enact.\nIs the wall such a project? That’s far from clear — and courts would quickly be asked to decide. The president’s own words might not help his case. He said that declaring an emergency would come “if I can’t make a deal” rather than because of the objective situation on the border. Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman goes as far as to argue that orders to the military to build the wall under these circumstances would be illegal — so illegal that a soldier could be prosecuted for following them.\nBut usually courts are loath to overrule presidential determinations of this sort by substituting their own judgment of what constitutes an “emergency.” In fact, nothing in the statute says there actually has to be a national emergency — only that the president declare that there is one. I’ve written before on presidents’ use of statutory interpretation in their favor; they find new meaning in old laws when they can’t get new laws passed. Trump’s action would do just this — it would build a wall, without first building consensus in Congress.\nAll this means that efforts to constrain executive authority can sometimes legitimate it. The NEA and IEEPA fit into laws passed after Watergate and the Vietnam War that were designed to limit presidential unilateralism and regain for Congress a real say in questions of war and peace, spending and ethics. But the NEA and IEEPA, like the War Powers Resolution, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and the Ethics in Government Act, were what the legal scholar Gerhard Casper has called “framework statutes.” They were laws designed not to solve a particular policy problem but to channel information and authority through new procedures and veto points. At the same time, they took presidential claims that used to be explicitly extralegal and gave them a new statutory grounding.\nBut to make such a framework work? That requires legislators to hold up their end of the bargain, and time after time, Congress has failed to",
        "baseline": " enforce its own prerogatives. For instance, since the NEA’s passage, Congress has never rescinded a declared emergency. These days, it is hard to imagine that it could. The NEA originally allowed legislators to cancel emergency powers with a concurrent resolution — a legislative vehicle that does not require presidential signature to become effective. But a 1983 Supreme Court ruling said such measures were not legally binding. A 1985 amendment to the NEA fixed that problem — but by requiring presidential signature, which also means the possibility of presidential veto.\nPerhaps an “emergency” will remind legislators of their past attacks on the “imperial presidency.” Otherwise, as Justice Robert Jackson wrote, dissenting in the infamous Korematsu case, the powers they provide “li[e] around like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.” And what “plausible claim” comes next?",
        "llm_baseline": "never done so.The NEA was supposed to be a way to force presidents to justify their use of emergency declarations and to give Congress a chance to terminate them.But Congress has never done so.The IEEPA was supposed to be a way to force presidents to justify their use of sanctions and to give Congress a chance to terminate them.But Congress has never done so.The Impeachment of Power Act was supposed to be a way to force presidents to justify their use of force and to give Congress a chance to terminate them.But Congress has never done so.The NEA and IEEPA are not part of the president s power toolkit,and the president has the power to declare an emergency whenever he wants. But the president does not have the power to declare an emergency whenever he wants.He has to do it in a way that is consistent with the Constitution.But the president does not have the power to declare an emergency whenever he wants.He has to do it in a way that is inconsistent with the Constitution.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

Well… Rockies fans do.\nNo doubt, the Rockies making the postseason would add to an already action-packed October.\n» Since I did this with the Broncos — making a preseason prediction — it only makes sense I would do this with the other major Denver-area sports teams that are kicking off their seasons.\nFor these next couple paragraphs, I will pretend to be a more in-tune hockey analyst than I actually am and pick the Avs to crack 100 points and comfortably make the playoffs, and perhaps even hang tough in a first-round series.\nExpect this young team to take that next step.\n» Speaking of young teams that should take that next step, the Nuggets should take a little more than just a mere step forward this season.\nAfter missing the playoffs last year by literally the slimmest of margins, the Nuggets should return to the court hungrier, wiser and perhaps even more talented than they were last year.\nIt adds up to a young but explosive team. It adds up to arguably one of the best collections of offensive talent — note, I said offensive — in league history. It adds up to 52 wins and home-court advantage in the first round.\n» Did I mention, life will go on even if the Rockies’ season doesn’t? That holds true particularly at the local high school level.\nTechnically, the Rockies’ season will still be intact when Greeley West and Greeley Central renew their football rivalry Friday — regardless of whether the Rockies’ postseason hopes are still intact.\nFor at least one of these teams, the excitement level will only intensify after Friday’s game. And, the intensity certainly won’t be lacking 7 p.m. Friday at District 6 Stadium.\nCheck back later this week for a preview and game coverage.\n» A lot will be at stake in this game between West and Central.\nA",

They would need just another win or two to carve themselves a spot in the playoffs, with such a strong 10-game regular season schedule.\nThe game has contrasting implications for Central.\nThe Wildcats (2-2) likely need this win to again be on track for a long-sought-after playoff appearance. Despite Central’s grit, it’s tough to identify more than one or two games the rest of the way in which the Wildcats won’t be significant underdogs.\n» This week’s box score: Five dimes and a reminder that youth is rarely served in professional sports… unless you’re the Avs or Nuggets.\nBobby Fernandez is The Tribune’s sports feature writer.

        "prompt": "These three companies have some of the most recognizable brand names in the world. Here's why our team of contributors thinks that each is a great candidate to buy and hold for the long term.\nThe forces of capitalism ensure that almost every company in the world will face a healthy amount of competition. One smart way companies look to overcome the competitive pressure is to make their brand names synonymous with the products or services they offer. Any company that can do so successfully stands a much better chance of increasing its market share over time, which usually leads to higher profitability.\nThat's a big reason we Fools love to buy stock in companies that have created a strong brand name that resonates with its customers. With that in mind, we reached out to a team of our Foolish contributors and asked them to highlight a big-brand company that they believe is a compelling buy today. Read on to find out which companies they like and see if you agree.\nRich Duprey: With all the speculation swirling that Kraft Heinz might make a play for cereal maker General Mills, it's worth noting that Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is the perennial favorite of M&A rumor-mongers. Its combination of powerhouse brands and a global footprint makes it a tempting target, though Warren Buffett has previously said it's too richly valued for him to make a bid on it.\nYet it could make a buyout candidate for someone, particularly a company that wanted to fend off an unwanted acquisition attempt. It's why General Mills has often been thought of as a possible buyer, because it, too, keeps cropping up in takeover talks.\nBut beyond the potential catalyst of a merger, investors should think about adding Mondelez International to their portfolios anyway. It holds the preeminent position in three important categories, including candy, chocolate, and biscuits, while generating 85% of its revenues from the snacks market. It was that growing segment that was the inspiration for Nelson Peltz to advocate that PepsiCo buy Mondelez, split off its drinks business into a separate unit, and focus on the public's snacking habits.\nOf course, Pepsi rejected his overtures and he ended his campaign, accepting instead a seat on Mondelez's board of directors. At less than 10 times earnings and only 21 times estimates -- which, considering analyst growth forecasts, gives it an enticing PEG ratio of less than 1 -- the global snack company should make a tasty morsel for investors.\nBrian Feroldi: You'd be hard pressed to find a company that's done a better job of making its brand name synonymous with beer than Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). The company spends billions of dollars each year to promote its huge stable of brands, which I think has been money well spent. The company now counts 19 brands in its lineup that each pulls in more than $1 billion in worldwide revenue, which creates a moat that competitors have found unable to breach.\nThat moat should help the company continue to churn out profits for decades, but the reason I think Anheuser-Busch InBev is an exciting investing idea today is that it's in the process of buying SABMiller, the No. 2 beer maker in the world. Regulators are still working out the details, but the company believes it's on schedule to close in the second half of the year. Once that happens, this company will control more than 30% of the worldwide beer market, making its already huge moat that much stronger.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev's rationale for the deal is that buying SABMiller will immediately give it a foothold in the emerging markets where it doesn't already have a big presence. Africa looks to be an area of particular interest, as consumer purchasing power in the region is growing quickly and SABMiller holds a strong position in the area. That will position the company for decades of above-average growth as those markets mature.\nWith shares trading for about 24 times next year's earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 3.1%, this is a fairly priced company that's poised to dominate for decades to come.\nDaniel B. Kline: Declining soft-drink sales have been ongoing bad news for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), but the company's stock has mostly recovered. The beverage brand has been trading in the $45 range -- close to its $47.13 52-week high. That's good news when you consider that the company is in the midst of a transformation and net revenue dropped by 4% in Q1 2016, where the company reported earnings per share of $0.36, down from $0.45 in the same quarter a year ago.\nThose numbers weren't awful, and the company's April 20 earnings report showed that the company's long-term transformation has started to work. Overall global volume was up 2%. The company has also stopped the bleeding in sparkling beverages (anything carbonated, including",
        "baseline": " soda), posting zero growth, but also zero decline. In addition, still-beverage sales grew by 7% -- a very encouraging sign that Coke has been able to move away from its reliance on soda.\nThe market has been wary of Coca-Cola because the company still has exposure in soda, a product line that suffers from negative press because of the health problems excessive consumption can lead to. But much of the suffering may be over in that market, and the bottom appears to have been found. Now, 18 months into CEO Muhtar Kent's transformation efforts, the needle is moving in the right direction.\nInvestors are overlooking Coca-Cola because of the soda stigma. But this isn't a cigarette company that had no other products to sell once its market became poisoned. Coke has the product lines and the distribution channels to sell consumers whatever they want to drink in the moment. That ultimately should lead to growth, even if soda sales remain stuck in neutral or go back into decline.",

With these sales added to new registration figures, the number of people a year buying motorcycles new or second-hand now exceeds half a million, with increasing numbers of journeys being ridden by motorcycles, scooters and mopeds.\nMCI director, Craig Carey-Clinch, says: \"The predictions for 2003 were not good, with a major foreign war, uncertainty in the economy and housing market making people think twice about buying new vehicles.\n\"However factors such as continuing traffic chaos and congestion charging, mean that interest in new motorcycles is sustained, with strong second-hand sales showing that biking in the UK remains vibrant and attractive to both commuter and leisure vehicle users.\"\nThe so-called \"born again\" biker brigade continue to pursue their lost youth, with most opting for the bigger bikes that they always yearned for, and can now afford.\nThe market is enjoying a new respectability, with the leather-clad Harley rider just as likely to be the managing director of a multi-national as a teenager.\nThe major players continue to include Kawasaki, BMW, Harley-Davidson, Honda, Ducati, Peugeot, Veloce and Triumph.\nHowever, leader of the pack is Suzuki, which cites dealer development, competitive pricing and customer loyalty for its achievement as the UK&apos;s best-",
        "baseline": "seller of motorcycles above 125cc last year.\nAlthough overall UK bike sales last year were four per cent down on 2002, Suzuki motorcycle registrations grew by two per cent giving them an overall market share rise of three per cent.\nThe importer was the only Japanese manufacturer to increase sales in the over 51cc category, claiming the best-selling motorcycle of the year title in the process.\nOfficial annual new registration figures issued by the Motor Cycle Industry Association, place the Suzuki GSX-R600 in pole position, with 2,403 buyers. In second place was the Suzuki GSX-R1000, with impressive sales of 2,380 to win the big bike war.\nThe GSX-R1000, which was the only big bike in the motorcycle total top ten, costs £8,549.\nNick Barnes, Suzuki GB general manager, says: \"For 2004 our strategy will be to freeze and in many instances reduce prices, thereby bucking the trend set by other manufacturers.\"",

        "prompt": "More than 30 residents at Warrigal Warilla must undergo a complete health and medical review due to concerns raised by the nation’s aged care watchdog. The Federal health department has slapped sanctions on the facility citing “an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety and well-being of care recipients” following information received by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC). The health department had “serious concerns” in relation to six areas of health and personal care, including medication, pain and behavioural management and palliative care. Additional failures which led to the decision to impose sanctions were in the vital areas of nutrition and hydration; emotional support; privacy and dignity and infection control. “The health, safety and well-being of older people who reside in aged care services is of paramount importance to the government,” a health department spokesman said. The action is another blow for the Warilla facility after a 48-year-old female staff member was charged in early January for allegedly assaulting five patients under her care between October and December. The woman will appear at Port Kembla Local Court on February 27. Under the sanctions, the Arcadia St facility will not be eligible for federal funding for any new care recipients for six months. It also stands to lose its approval as an aged care provider unless it complies with all 44 national standards of care by July 16. Warrigal has also been forced to appoint an advisor and administrator to help the home get back up to standard, and must provide training to all staff. As well, Warrigal CEO, Mark Sewell said the facility had taken further measures to improve standards since the unannounced audit, which took place over six days early last month. He said the Warilla facility had met all 44 standards in July last year, and he was confident all concerns would be addressed by this July. “We are very sorry that this recent situation has developed so quickly over the December/ January holiday period and want to reassure our residents, their families and our staff, we are doing everything we can to turn this situation around as quickly as possible,” Mr Sewell said. “… The special sanction period is for six months and means we wont be admitting any new residents to the home whilst we focus fully on the improvements to the health management of the residents who live at the home, especially the small number of residents the commission has asked us to focus on. “We have confidence that we can turn this situation around very quickly.” Mr Sewell said 31 residents had been specifically mentioned in the audit as needing improvement to their health management. “All of these residents are having a complete health and medical review and we will be implementing every recommendation made by the doctors, nurses, and other health professionals,” he said. The facility currently houses 82 residents ranging in age from 82 to 98, who are cared for by 117 staff. “Their health conditions are complex and include dementia, high care, complex behaviours, dialysis and multi-faceted health issues,” Mr Sewell said. Residents and relatives were informed of the health department’s decision at a meeting on January 30. The health department and ACQSA are continuing to monitor the service. ACQSA – which began operations on January 1, 2019 – will integrate and streamline the governance roles of the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner and the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, creating a new one-stop-shop. It has received funding of almost $300 million over four years; including an additional $48.2 million to expand monitoring, secure aged care quality and employ a network of dozens of additional senior compliance officers. The commission will be underpinned by a new aged care Charter of Rights and is set to enforce a new, single set of Quality Standards, the first upgrade of standards in 20 years.\nThe health department and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are continuing to monitor the service.\nMore than 30 residents at Warrigal Warilla must undergo a complete health and medical review due to concerns raised by the nation’s aged care watchdog.\nThe Federal health department has slapped sanctions on the facility citing “an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety and well-being of care recipients” following information received by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC).\nThe health department had “serious concerns” in relation to six areas of health and personal care, including medication, pain and behavioural management and palliative care.\nAdditional failures which led to the decision to impose sanctions were in the vital areas of nutrition and hydration; emotional support; privacy and dignity and infection control.\n“The health, safety and well-being of older people who reside in aged care services is of paramount importance to the government,” a health department spokesman said.\nThe action is another blow for the Warilla facility after a 48-year-old female staff member was charged in early January for allegedly assaulting five patients under her care between October and December.

Daniel McDuff has a shocking solution -- literally.\nDaniel McDuff works at the MIT Media Lab -- also home to fellow WIRED 2015 speaker Hiroshi Ishii -- where he builds scalable tools to enable the automated recognition of emotions and physiology. One of the instruments he designed was the 'Pavlov Poke', a tool designed to wean users off addictive social media sites.\nMcDuff, who is a WIRED Innovation Fellow, worked with Robert Morris to create code that will display on-screen alert if a distracting site is visited too frequently. An Arduino is connected to the computer via USB and when a shock is triggered, the Arduino activates a relay and starts the shock circuit, triggering a current through conductive metal strips placed on the keyboard.\nMcDuff is also interested in emotion, and how it relates to computing -- \"I see emotional connections between humans and devices as being really important,\" he told the audience at WIRED 2015 at London's Tobacco Dock. In 2011, Daniel collaborated with Affectiva to produce the first demonstration of large-scale emotion measurement, using webcams to capture viewers' facial expressions during Super Bowl commercials.\nOur devices, McDuff says, are able to track not only our outward expressions -- a smile or a furrowed brow, for example -- but also the inner manifestations of emotion. Using signal processing, and by looking at the light reflected from the human face, we can measure heart rate, respiratory rate and blood flow. \"Emotions matter,\" McDuff told the WIRED 2015 audience. \"They make us feel alive, they filter what we remember about experiences, they influence what we choose to do and where we choose to go. We're surrounded by amazing tech, but despite the amazing cognitive intelligence computers have, they have no emotional intelligence. They just don't understand humans the way we do.\"\nEmotions matter. They make us feel alive, they filter what we remember about experiences, they influence what we choose to do and where we choose to go.\nEmotionally intelligent tech could have many manifestations; a mirror that could tell how bad your night's sleep was when you looked in it, a fridge that recognised what you were eating and advised you on your diet, or a car that could help you understand exactly the impact of your stress levels as you drove to work. The potential of emotionally aware computing, he says, are devices that can sense, understand and adapt to emotions. \"I have two main passions,\" McDuff told WIRED 2015. \"Education and healthcare. There's been this massive proliferation of high quality online courses, but there's no way for teachers to get feedback from their students -- when they're struggling, or when they're engaged. It would be amazing if we could allow students to simply turn on their webcam and contribute the data back.\" \"In terms of healthcare, there are a number of conditions that are extremely hard to track. Depression, for example, is a condition that affects many people, but clinicians have no good way of understanding how people's feelings are changing throughout treatment -- is a drug having a positive effect, is therapy working? By using this kind of sensor data, we could",
        "baseline": " quantify how people feel, give this data to their clinicians and ensure better care for patients.\"\nSmart watches or smart phones could also help someone who suffers from depression. By tracking blood flow, heart rate, respiratory rate and sympathetic nervous system response, sufferers of depression could share stats with friends, families and clinicians in order to track treatment.\nWhat about those detractors who are worried about the negative potential of a computer that can measure how we feel? McDuff says it's \"crucial that we think about the social impact\" of such technology. \"It's important that people actively opt in to share their data. We often mask our emotions -- we smile when we're sad -- and having the ability to mash our emotions is really important. We're focusing on ways to manage how and when emotions are measured.\" \"Ultimately, I believe that this technology will help us interact much more naturally with the people around us, to live healthier lives, and ultimately help us care for one another more effectively.\"",

Since a short but brutal civil war in 2007, Fatah has ruled the West Bank while Hamas has controlled Gaza.\nAs I wrote when the unity deal was first announced, it’s important to recognize the extent to which internal Palestinian political dynamics have driven this move. Facing broad popular discontent with their division, the creation of a unity government offers a political advantages for both factions. Reconciliation is hugely popular amongst Palestinians. In March 2011, tens of thousands turned out in both Gaza and the West Bank to call for an end to the division. An April 2013 poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center found that over 90 percent favored reconciliation between the two factions.\nWith the negotiations with Israel (which he entered against the wishes of the majority of his own party) ended for the moment, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas clearly saw reconciliation as something to boost his flagging popularity and at a time when he is in a relatively stronger position vis a vis Hamas.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called upon the international community not to accept the new government, since it is supported by Hamas, who both Israel and the United States classify as a terrorist group. The new Palestinian government “doesn’t bolster peace, it bolsters terror,” Netanyahu said in comments",
        "baseline": " on Israel Radio.\nThe U.S. and its partners in the Middle East Peace Quartet (the United Nations, EU, and Russia) have held that, in order to join a Palestinian government, Hamas must meet three conditions, known as the “Quartet principles”: Recognize Israel, accept past agreements signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and renounce terrorism.\nWhile past efforts at reconciliation have fallen apart quickly, this current effort appears, for the moment, to have legs. A key outstanding question has to do with the future of Hamas’ armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. A Hamas source said last month that they would not disband their militia, but instead envisioned a “Hezbollah model” in Palestine, which sounds encouraging to no one. A monopoly over the use of force is regarded as the defining feature of a state, and the record on governments whose parties maintained their own armed forces is not a good one.",

These, to him, are those who do not want Nigerians to enjoy the good things of life as they are now doing under the Buhari administration. In this interview with JOSEPH JIBUEZE, Sagay speaks on the state of the judiciary and what is being done with recovered funds, among other issues.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has blamed the judiciary for frustrating corruption cases. How would you assess the judiciary ahead of the new legal year?\nLet me start by saying that the President was right. The judiciary, acting as presidential tribunals, was a disaster. They did many terrible things, particularly in 2007. That was a most shameless act at a high level, where they could open their eyes and write that a ballot paper without serial number is a valid ballot paper. It never happened anywhere in the world. That was most shameless. There have been a lot of improvements since then, even though we still have corrupt judges. There is no question about that – at all levels. But the level of corruption has gone down. There is an attempt to fall in with the spirit of the anti-corruption struggle that the Buhari administration has introduced.\nI always say that the Chief Justice’s directive that special courts should be designated by Chief Judges of various courts in the country for corruption cases only, and the establishment of a monitoring group, are very excellent ideas. They were ideas we were pursuing for which we were not successful because the National Assembly to whom we sent the bills refused to consider them. But the Chief Justice did it administratively and they’re operating and doing very well. You heard recently that two former governors were sentenced to lengthy imprisonments and it was by one of these courts. So, I’m encouraged by that. But, we’re still watching the Judiciary. Everything is not perfect yet. We’re still far away from the type of Judiciary we had, particularly the type of Supreme Court we had when Eso, Oputa, Mohammed Bello, Obaseki, Karibi-Whyte, Nnamani were there. Then we had the best Supreme Court in the world. It has dropped sharply since then. So, we are nowhere near there. And I keep telling the present crop of judges, including the Supreme Court justices who are all my juniors, that they should aspire to what we had before. They’re not there yet and I want to see them positively aspiring to that.\nSome have said the holidays judges enjoy are too long – from July to September, in addition to Easter and Christmas vacations. In view of court congestion, would you recommend a reduction?\nI have a slightly different opinion. The work of a judge is very, very demanding, mentally and extremely demanding. They have to do a lot of reading to write a single judgment, and do a lot of analysis, and after that begin to crunch their brains about where the law is, and not only law, where justice is leading them. So, if they have a two-month holiday, I don’t mind. My complaint against them is the callousness with which some judges – and many judges do it – will not sit and they will not tell you before hand. You come there prepared; you’ve given up the whole day just for the case, you’re in court and you’ll be told the judge had gone somewhere. The registrar would just tell you the judge had gone somewhere. That’s an insult on the lawyers and an insult on the people of this country, for a judge to just take off, and they have our phone numbers. Nobody will call you. That’s number one. Number two, their conferences are too many. One conference today, another one tomorrow – seminar in Dubai. There is too much laxity, a sort of I don’t care attitude about the sufferings of lawyers and their clients. I do not have the feeling that judges are concerned.\nHave you had a personal experience?\nWhen I was much younger, about 20 years ago, I went to the Court of Appeal, then presided over by the present Emir of Ilorin. I got there and they had pasted something at the gate, after I had left my office. So, I wrote a stinker to him, which he did not take well. He too wrote a stinker back and when next I appeared before the court they gave me hell in a case I was handling before them. But that’s not the right spirit. They were wrong. So, for me, what they should do is cut down on holidays, be more sensitive about their role in the society, and be more concerned about the fate of parties, who want their cases to end. They should also show more respect to lawyers, because when you leave the court without notice that you’re not going to be there and a lawyer comes, that’s an insult to that lawyer. You’re both lawyers for goodness sake. That you’re on the Bench doesn’t make you a different person. That lawyer can become a judge tomorrow. That is lack of respect! And it’s very bad.\nWhat else can be done to address delays?\nTo conclude this part, because it’s a very important point you’re raising, the cases that are outstanding are so many. They go on for 10 years and yet are not concluded. There is need for them to be conscious of this. There is need for the government to provide recording equipment. If you go to London, where I have appeared several times as an expert witness on Nigerian law, the judge has a computer in front of him, and there is a lady who is recording in addition to the computer, and the judge is very relaxed because he is asking questions and not writing anything – very relaxed. At the end of the day, before you go, you get the proceedings. They just roll it out of the computer and you take it home. So, you can see that the judges are living longer; they’re fresher. The judges here have to take everything by hand. You say something, they’ll write. You have to wait for them, and speak very slowly because you know they can’t write at the rate at which you’re speaking. So, it takes a long time. There is strain; they suffer from all sorts of diseases – back diseases, brain diseases as a result. So, we must – there’s no choice – introduce recording equipment. That will hasten proceedings.\nSome courts too are not very honest. At times the vote is prepared and given to them to buy these equipment; they will not buy it. The next year, they will apply again for another vote on the same thing. That is also there. There are lots of problems. We just have to sit down and think of the people of this country; think of the service we’re delivering as one major arm of government and be proud of what we’re doing. As it is now, they cannot be proud. None of us is proud of what is happening now, because cases are taking so long. It’s scandalous. Some cases take over 20 years. The Supreme Court is so congested now that if you file an appeal, don’t expect it to be heard in five years. It’s not good. For me, it’s a failed system that is being run now. The Chief Justice, the National Judicial Council and all these top judges should meet and think of a way out. Maybe one other thing they can do to help them is to have clerks made up of young, brilliant law graduates attached to them to do their research and even write their preliminary judgments, which the judge will then go through and improve upon. But they need to get together and do something.\nWhat is your reaction to claims that the anti-graft war is selective, and that the focus seems to be on those in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)?\nNo. The PDP was in power from 1999 to 2015. They were the ones who had access to Nigeria’s assets and resources. And they had an inclination and orientation of simply helping themselves to state assets without looking back. I mean, it was just a horrible thing. I’ll just give you one example. When they were there, they were fraudulently obtaining petroleum subsidy amounting to N380billion a year, saying they had supplied petroleum products, which they never supplied. You’ve seen all the recoveries that have been made. Look at what they did during the elections when Diezani brought her billions to bribe INEC officials all over the place, including Rivers State. That’s why I laugh when Wike says he has been elected. The Rivers State chief electoral officer was bribed. And she deliberately distorted that election and ensured that it was rigged in favour of Wike. A lot has happened since then. Our reserves dropped from over about $50billion to less than $2billion. They were spending money like water. In the last days, Jonathan was travelling round the West, dolling out huge amounts of dollars to Obas and so on. Look at the former National Security Adviser; look at the amount of money, just walking into Central Bank to take away $46million in sacks. It was so primitive and brazen. That is why they are the ones being prosecuted; because their impunity was so high that I don’t think it’s been experienced in this country before.\nSome still say the EFCC only goes after those in the PDP. They say for instance, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom was accused of corruption after his defection to PDP. Consequently, the state’s account was frozen . To them, the EFCC is being used as a political tool. Are you worried about that?\nNo, I’m not worried at all about that. There must be a good reason they went after him. I don’t have the details. But that man himself…I don’t want to say much. This is a man, who says today oh I’m going to PDP, tomorrow he says no I’m not going again. Then the third day he said I’m gone. And not that he went on his own volition. He said youths forced him… I mean, what sort of human being is that? Is he fit to be governor, a man who doesn’t have his own mind? So I don’t know what he’s done with security money.\nYou’re right, but I can tell you one thing. The EFCC from what I know is investigating all former governors and keeping a tab on serving ones. It has their records, and progressively, given its capacity, one by one, they’re going to be called to answer. There’s nothing they can even do to him. He can’t be arrested. They can investigate him, put down the records of what they found, waiting for him to finish his tenure. Right now nobody can touch him. As for freezing Benue State’s account, I can’t support it. I don’t know why, but the government has to function. I don’t want people to suffer because there are no funds for basic government functions. I don’t know if they really did that; we have to be careful because it looks extreme to me.\nSome still wonder where all the huge recoveries made by the Federal Government are going. How is the money being spent?\nThis issue has been explained again and again and again. This money, one, is being paid to the Central Bank, every kobo. This is Buhari’s government for goodness sake. This is not PDP. Every kobo is being paid to the Central Bank. And in the last two years, N1trillion has been withdrawn from it. For last year, N500billion was used to pay N5,000 each to the poorest households in this country based on the United Nations standards, which was scientifically followed, to get them out of nothingness. The Federal Government is feeding 10.5 million school children every day; children, who otherwise would not have had any nutritious meal. In fact, because of that, enrolment has gone up. Many parents are sending their children to school so that they can eat. It’s going to increase because not all states have joined. As a result, cooks have been given employment – a large number of cooks. Egg sellers all over the country are supplying eggs. Farmers are making sales. The multiplier effect has been tremendous. Young men, who have no skills are being trained and they’re paid N30,000 a month for the period of the training. A lot of young people, particularly women and young farmers, who need capital for their little businesses are being loaned N300,000 each without interest. All they need to do is to pay back the principal sum for their businesses to grow. That’s what the money is being used for. The money is not just being spent. It is budgeted for and approved by the National Assembly.\nWhat is your reaction to the Department of State Services (DSS) siege on the National Assembly, which prevented lawmakers from accessing it?\nIt is most embarrassing. I was watching television when suddenly we saw DSS men blocking people from entering the National Assembly. My initial reaction was that this must have been ordered by the Presidency to avoid violence because we heard some people were going to invade the place. But I was shocked later to find out that there was no such directive; that in fact, it was the initiative of the DSS itself, which is totally illegal. They don’t have that power. They’re supposed to operate under the President’s directive. So, what they did was grossly illegal. They portrayed us in a very bad light, and shutting down parliament in effect. Parliament could be shut down in order to avert worse things. If PDP and APC are going to exchange blows, destroy things and kill themselves, the place could be shut down. But that was not happening. What DSS did was unconstitutional, illegal, and was against the interest of Nigeria as a democratic country. And as soon as the Acting President got to know, he took immediate steps, ordered them out of the place, and of course, dismissed the head of the DSS for doing such a patently illegal thing.\nNigerians have criticised the Buhari administration for not responding to the allegation that Finance Minister Mrs Kemi Adeosun skipped the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme and forged an exemption certificate. What do you think?\nLet me tell you this. I don’t know why the government has not reacted. But, let me tell you my reaction. This woman is a brilliant and extremely valuable member of this government. A lot of the good things happening now – the welfare that Nigerians are enjoying or are going to enjoy, because it takes time, and the way our economy is booming, how we got out of recession – are due to her expertise, her commitment, her sacrifice. There is nothing in this world that will make me remove such a woman from the government. The PDP can weep from now until there is no tear in their body; she is going to be there. We cannot afford to lose that woman.\nWhat about the allegation that she skipped Youth Service?\nYouth Service…Who cares about Youth Service? I don’t bloody care whether she did Youth Service or not. It is irrelevant as far as I am concerned.\nWhat about the allegation that she forged an exemption certificate?\nI don’t believe it. I don’t see anything serious about not doing Youth Service. I don’t see anything serious about it. That’s my own bias, not government’s. I’m telling you now. If you ask me – if I were President Buhari, I would never, ever touch that woman because she’s damn good. The enemies of this government want to reduce his capacity to provide good governance by engaging in social media attacks and trying to get rid of her. It will not work.\nBut the government is not reacting, don’t you see it as an issue?\nI don’t know why. Governance continues.\nBut if the law says every Nigerian under 30 must serve their fatherland, isn’t it a violation of the law to skip NYSC?\nI have nothing against anybody taking part in NYSC. Why not? That is what the law requires. What I am saying is that if, per chance, somebody for some reason misses it, that’s not the end of the world. I did not do NYSC; I graduated before it was introduced. And it hasn’t affected me negatively in any way. So, I’m not going to allow bad belle PDP-type to try to reduce the capacity of this government to do good things and bring welfare to the people of this country by removing a very valuable member of this government. Let me put it this way. I look at the whole picture. If you remove Adeosun from this government, it will adversely affect the government and, therefore, adversely affect the welfare and well-being being enjoyed by this country because of her work. So, I’m not going to allow a little quirk about NYSC to affect that greater value that she is rendering to this country. I am saying that if I were the President, I will not bat an eyelid over that. But that does not mean I am downplaying the importance of the NYSC. No. But I am not going to allow it upset the functioning of the government. Every rule has an exception. There is no rule that is absolute. There are many people in this country today who didn’t do NYSC and they’re working one way or the other because they have a good reason for not serving.\nAs a matter of honour.\nNot as a matter of law?\nNo, no, he’s not compelled by law to do so. He needs to be removed by two-thirds majority. But as a matter of honour. He got there because he was in APC even though he got there by subterfuge, which is typical of him. He got there in a cheeky, fraudulent manner. Nevertheless, for him to be removed, they need a vote of two-thirds, not of the Senate, but of those present and voting at a meeting. So, it doesn’t have to be everybody. It’s those who happen to be there. Once they meet the quorum of one-third, and he is there, he can be removed by two-thirds of that one-third.\nWhat is your message to Nigerians ahead of 2019 elections?\nNigerians don’t appear to appreciate that they’re very lucky to have the present government; that they have a government that is totally committed to the welfare of this country. I think probably since the First Republic and perhaps during the Murtala Mohammed regime and of course, the first coming of Buhari, we’ve never had a government of this type where everybody is charged to sacrifice at little or no expense to the government for this country; where there is zero tolerance for corruption; zero tolerance for self-help; where you have a group of highly committed Nigerians, who are experts in their fields trying to raise us from the pit into which the PDP has pushed us.\nIf we don’t allow this government to continue – I call it the government on the rescue – for four years at least, beyond 2019, then this country is doomed. We’re very lucky to have the team we have now. And it is in our own interest to support them to achieve the goals they have set for this country. I always say that if I were Buhari, I probably would have thrown in the towel out of anger. I’m short tempered when I see the way Nigerians are not showing appreciation for the good that is being done. Let us eliminate those, who benefited from corruption, and they’re many – the elite, people in our own class, they were the ones sharing the money. There was easy money. We need them to get back what we have lost and to build on that to begin to gradually move away from this status of underdevelopment.\nIf you see all the projects – when did you go to the East last? Enugu-Onitsha, the East-West Road, railways, the airports are being upgraded, so much is being done. Abuja has its own city rail. Then there’s a train from Abuja to Kaduna. There’s one from Lagos to Ibadan, virtually completed. They’",

All these roads – some will be tolled, and the money will be gradually repatriated to the lenders. And the people of Nigeria will enjoy a high standard of living that we’ve never been used to.\nThey’re trying to inculcate a culture of integrity and honour, where Nigerians will work hard for what they earn, not to go and steal, grab and loot as has been the case so far. So, if we miss this government, if there’s any mistake and it doesn’t come back in 2019, I say good luck to Nigerians.",

        "prompt": "Editors' Note: Updated at 9:14 a.m. ET on Dec. 6 to include new information that OnePlus' future phone will be \"one of the first\" with the Snapdragon 855.\nWAILEA, Hawaii — The Snapdragon 855 mobile processor may have just been announced, but it's already gotten at least one phone maker to reveal its plans for the new chipset. OnePlus, which specializes in affordably priced flagship phones, originally said on stage at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Tech Summit on Wednesday (Dec. 5) that it would be the first to launch an 855-powered device next year. Now, however, the company is walking back that statement.\nCredit: OnePlus/QualcommOnePlus' 2019 flagship will actually be among the first with the new chipset, according to Engdaget, which confirmed the clarification with a OnePlus spokesperson.\n\"We appreciate the opportunity to clarify that we will be one of the first to have access to, and use, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855,\" the statement given to Engadget reads. \"We apologize for the miscommunication.\"\nApparently, the Chinese version of OnePlus' slide deck that was shown at the summit correctly said the startup's next phone would be \"among the first\" to receive the 855, while a mistranslation in the English version wrongly called it the first, full stop. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau had taken the stage early during the Day 2 keynote of Qualcomm's event to make the announcement.\nIt could have been a big win for OnePlus, as the Snapdragon 855 figures to power a lot of flagship Android phones in 2019. Verizon and AT&T have already announced plans to build 5G-ready phones with Samsung next year, and so have LG and Sprint. Since 5G compatibility is a major feature for the Snapdragon 855, it's a safe assumption those chips would run on Qualcomm's latest chipset, too. Yesterday's announcement suggested that OnePlus would beat them to the punch.\nLau didn't disclose exactly when its Snapdragon 855-powered phone would debut. Typically, OnePlus introduces a new flagship every five months. This fall's OnePlus 6T debuted in October, five months after the OnePlus 6's May unveiling. It's unclear if OnePlus intends to speed up that release schedule so that it can be earlier to the market with the Snapdragon 855.\nBut the",
        "baseline": " new phone apparently won't be called the OnePlus 7, at least based on what Lau told Cnet in an interview. Instead, this 5G-ready, Snapdragon 855-powered device will be separate from OnePlus' regular phone lineup. That could be because this phone will likely cost far more than the sub-$550 starting prices OnePlus charges for its current flagships. Lau estimated that 5G compatibility could add $200 to $300 to the phone's cost.\nQualcomm is revealing more details about the Snapdragon 855 today. But we already know that the new chipset will feature support for an embedded fingerprint sensor — something OnePlus already features in the 6T — an improved AI engine, and an updated image signal processor that adds intelligence to smartphone cameras. We'll have additional information about the Snapdragon 855 as it becomes available.\nIn addition to delivering one of the first Snapdragon 855 phones, OnePlus said it would have the first 5G phone available in Europe, using EE's mobile network.",

        "prompt": "When George Roman III started coming to the Canfield Fair 60-plus years ago, it was a simpler time.\nHe grows nostalgic reflecting on those days, when grandparents, parents and kids would pile into their car and head out for a long day at the fairgrounds, picnic lunches in tow.\nHe remembers, too, the days in the 1950s when he and his neighborhood friends would return to comb the fairgrounds for scattered soda bottles after the fair ended. They’d return the bottles to their local grocery store for the 2- and 5-cent deposits that people had paid for them.\nReminiscing on those days, his voice seeps nostalgia.\n“I think it’s a lot of hustle and bustle now. Way back when I started coming to the fair, it was more laid back and easygoing,” said Roman, now the fair director for concessions, grandstand and special attractions.\nLike countless other lifelong fairgoers in the community, Roman has seen the fair evolve to an event that retains many of its traditional features but is constantly updated with modern twists.\nToday’s fairgoers have greater concern for safety and security than when he was a kid. In the 1950s, parents didn’t think twice about sending young children to the fair without adult supervision, he noted.\nThe Mahoning County Agricultural Society started the fair in 1847 as a way to celebrate agriculture. The Vindicator obtained a copy of “The Enduring Traditions,” a book on 150 years of the Canfield Fair written by Charlotte Agustin.\nInside its pages, the beginnings of the fair are given life. Then, fairs were very important to farmers.\n“Unless you can keep up a love and interest in all the various productions of the soil, and its domestic animals, you cannot keep up with your fairs, and if the fairs are not kept up, your fields will not be,” reads an excerpt from Eben Newton’s speech at the Oct. 7, 1862 fair.\nThe founders of the fair “knew that only by attending a fair can people be educated, and only with excited attention can that learning become a lasting enrichment for all,” the book states.\nFrom the beginning, the fair has been filled with dances, music, contests, pageants, parades and animals.\nThe early days brought performances by local talent. After World War II, fairgoers wanted something new.\nIn 1957, Fair Board Director William Kilcawley arranged for the Lennon Sisters to perform.\nField crops and livestock were always an important part of the fair. Back in 1847, there were four vegetable and two fruit and flower classes, according to “The Enduring Traditions.” That first year also brought 30 cattle, six sheep, three swine and 12 horse classes.\nMedical displays began in 1952, and the international exhibits came in 1962. In 1848, the “Ladies’ Fair” featuring arts and crafts was introduced.\nOne aspect of the Canfield Fair that cannot be forgotten is the food.\n“The appeal of food is one of the strongest motivations for repeated visits to the Canfield Fair,” the book reads.\nBack in 1861, one concession sold $200 worth of candy. Isaly’s was a mainstay at the fair in the 1900s with its cones, milkshakes, ice cream sandwiches and swiss cheese on rye bread.\nToday, it’s the DiRusso’s Italian sausage sandwiches, Molnar’s cinnamon rolls and Richardson’s french fries that are among the top concessions.\nRoller coasters got their start at the fair in 1885 when a primitive version was introduced. During the Civil War, swings were the fair’s only ride attraction. Bates Amusement Co. now brings in metal giants to spin its riders around and upside down.\nThe first year of the fair 1,500 people attended. In 2015, the fair drew 282,386 visitors over its six days. In 1979, 539,437 attended the fair — setting an unbroken record.\nAdmission fees didn’t start until 1851 after five acres were purchased for a permanent fair location. Back then, it was one shilling or 12.5 cents to attend the fair. This year, the admission fees range from $6 to $8 for adults depending on the day.\nDespite the changes that have come with time, the fair remains what it’s been for the past 170 years: a tradition and a celebration of Mahoning Valley farms.\nTo commemorate the 170th anniversary of that tradition, The Vindicator looked through the trove of archive files on the fair, which feature decades of headlines noting new attendance records, expansions and improvements at the fairgrounds. They also chronicle weather events – from idyllic sunny days, to gales that left the fairgrounds empty and flooded.\nWorth noting: As the longest-running media to cover the fair as the sum total of all daily newspapers published in Youngstown since 1869, The Vindicator on-site archives on the Canfield Fair starts in 1921, where a story notes attendance of 35,000 at the 75th Canfield Fair.\nHere are some other milestones The Vindicator crowed about during the fair’s history.\nIn July 1925, a new grandstand and race track are dedicated.\nIn 1936, fair attendance hits 100,000 people.\nIn 1937, the admission price goes up 15 cents, to 40 cents.

John Carney Jr. and Rear Adm. Meredith Austin, Fifth Coast Guard district commander.\nManley drowned nearly two years ago saving his then-17-year-old stepson, Andrew Short, off the coast of Sandbridge, Virginia, after being caught in a rip current.\nIndian River Coast Guard Chief James Pond said Manley’s sacrifice on Sept. 27, 2015, was an inspiration to all Coast Guardsmen.\n“Every day, men and women of this station train to assist anyone in danger out at sea. What your father did is an inspiration to me and my crew,” Pond said, fighting tears as he addressed Manley’s son, Michael Manley Jr., 5, and stepson Andrew Short, now 19.\n“Your father could certainly have served alongside us any day,” Pond said.\nThe Lifesaving Medal is one of the oldest medals in the U.S., and can be awarded to both civilians and members of the military. It is awarded to those who “performed a rescue or attempted rescue at the risk of his or her own life” and who demonstrated “such extraordinary effort as to merit recognition,” according to the Medals and Awards Manual of the U.S. Coast Guard.\nOnly 1,900 or so Silver Lifesaving Medals have been awarded since an Act of Congress established the award in 1874.\nManley, who was a civilian, was also honored with the Carnegie Medal for heroism in February.\nShe said Manley, at 6 feet 3 inches tall, 230 pounds and bedecked in tattoos, had an appearance that belied his inner kindheartedness.\nShe described Manley as a “gentle giant” with a golden heart, who would help anyone with anything whether or not they’d asked for it; who gave money to the homeless, helped strangers and opened the door for anyone, anywhere.\n“It wasn’t because it was the easy thing to do,” she said. “It was because it was the right thing to do. He never wanted anything in return for anything he did, and he’d also be very embarrassed that we were making a big deal out of it today.\nWhat Manley did was recounted by Andrew Short, who said he owes his life and his future to Manley.\nThe skies were clear and the water looked beautiful and calm, he said.\n“Like a villain in disguise,” Short said.\nLike any 17-year-old at the beach would have done, he dove in and swam out. A few short moments later, he said, he realized something was wrong.\n“I turned my head and saw that I was about a football field away from the shore. I got a knot in my stomach like something wasn’t right,” he said.\nShort tried to turn back, swimming straight to shore against the current, and quickly realized he was in trouble.\nManley was right beside him in an instant, he said, telling him to calm down, to relax, to not swim against the current. The words soothed him, Short said, giving him “that extra punch to keep going,” and he made his way to the shore.\n“It felt like it took me 15 minutes, but it was probably only a couple of minutes,” he said. “I’ve never been so exhausted in my life.\n“It was that close, it was just so close,” he said.\nShort finally lifted his head off the sandy shore to tell Manley that he was safe. He said he saw Manley trying to swim back in but, eventually, he vanished.\nManley was pulled out to sea by the same current that nearly killed his stepson. A search was performed by local rescue teams — 911 had been called as soon as",

John Carney Jr. spoke about Manley’s 2015 sacrifice.\nAddressing Short and Michael Manley Jr., the governor said they will be here to remind the world of what Manley did.\n“We are eternally grateful for his service that day,” he said.\nAndrew Short said he’s still trying to answer the question of how to spend his life. He’s strongly considering becoming a motivational speaker, helping young people who went through similar experiences come to grips with their struggles and carry on.\n“I feel like if I could talk to people who have been through things like I have, I could show them that it’s not the end of the world,” he said. “I could show them that I lived through it and so can they.",

We don't want the police to be against us.\"\nBuses loaded with police in flak jackets can be seen in the streets leading up to the square. The justice ministry issued a warning reminding citizens that the police have the right to disperse demonstrations regardless of the nature of the protests.\nProtests against Mr Sargsyan have been held in other parts of Armenia - the second largest city of Guymri and the city of Vanadzor.\nHow did Sunday's meeting fall apart?\nMr Pashinyan was previously jailed over his part in protests against Mr Sargsyan in 2008. He recently described the campaign he leads as a \"velvet revolution\", referring to the peaceful protests in 1989 that ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia.\nHe met Mr Sargsyan at a hotel in Yerevan on Sunday morning, in the presence of dozens of journalists.\nThe exchange was brief. After the prime minister said he was glad his rival had \"responded to my numerous appeals to negotiate\", Mr Pashinyan struck an uncompromising note.\n\"I think there is a misunderstanding,\" he said. \"I have come here to discuss the terms of your resignation and the terms of a peaceful and smooth transition of power.\"\nMr Sargsyan said that \"this is not a dialogue, this is blackmail\" and left.\nAddressing the assembled reporters afterwards, Mr Pashinyan called on his supporters to continue their protests, which have continued for more than a week.\nHe was detained shortly afterwards, as riot police using stun grenades dispersed protesters.\nHis supporters then gathered outside a police station where they believed he was being held before they set off towards the capital's central Republic Square.\nWhy is there such anger at Serzh Sargsyan?\nHe has been accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home.\nHis government has also been criticised by the opposition for its close ties to Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin also moved between the positions of president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power.\nWhile he was president, the country shifted from a presidential system to a parliamentary republic, vesting real power in the office of the prime minister.\nHe stood for prime minister despite promising he would not.\nHis supporters argue that the tough veteran of the Nagorno-Karabakh war with Azerbaijan in the late 1980s has provided the national security Armenia needs.\nSerzh Sargsyan, who served as president from 2008 until this year, has been left largely unchallenged for years because of a lack",
        "baseline": " of clear rivals and alternatives, Armenian affairs analyst Richard Giragosian tells BBC News.\n\"Pashinyan was the exception with his unique combination of charisma with a good sense of street politics, which only makes this current confrontation more serious.\" he says.\nThe power of the ruling Republican Party is potentially even more dangerous as it \"undermines the necessity for consensus and compromise\".\n\"The real question now is what lies ahead. After such polarisation and dissent, the launch of parliamentary politics seems destined to fail, undermined by an inherent lack of trust or public confidence.\"\nHowever the crisis plays out, \"there is little or no foreign policy dimension\", he adds. \"It is not about Russia and not about Europe. It is local politics and economics.\"\nThe small landlocked country saw an economic recovery last year, the World Bank reports.\nHowever, it is vulnerable to developments in Russia, its biggest trading partner after the EU and a major destination for its migrant workers.",

I never have consumed marijuana and I’m not an investor in the new industry.\nBig picture: Nobody in the panel of former and current mayors at Vail’s State of the Town meeting mentioned impacts of recreational marijuana when describing Vail’s future. This given that the governor has said we are into uncharted territory that will bring great change.\nGet with the program: The operative word for marijuana is really cannabis and the substance giving the high is THC.\nAreas of focus: The amendment talked about retail sales, production (growing) and assembly, testing and distribution. To this list you must add smoking clubs and places for consumption. Hotels are just starting to think about the impacts of smoking the product in rooms and halls.\nIt’s in the brownies: Most think of smoking, but consider that the product is also sold in foodstuffs.\nTransition: The proponents of the amendment made the analogy that going down to your local marijuana shop will be like going down to your local liquor shop. Perhaps, but did they really understand the growing pains after Prohibition was repealed in 1933?\nBig bucks: If cannabis-related commercial space (including retail) is up for grabs to the highest bidder, there is so much money involved, they will outbid just about anybody else. For perspective, consider a group of investors trying to purchase a metal building in Westcliffe for growing cannabis. The newish building was constructed for a metal fabrication shop that went out of business. The sticking point is not price, but whether the town will allow it. Note that cannabis grown at higher altitudes (Westcliffe is at 7,900 feet) has a higher THC content. Further, the predictions are",

If it’s just like a liquor store, is it by default West Vail? But if the council wants to ensure vibrancy and no empty storefronts, why not allow the new retailers to lease higher price-per-square-foot locations in town?\nBuilding walls: Not allowing retail cannabis in Vail will not dampen consumption. It certainly will increase demand for taxi service and rental cars to go downvalley.\nLemons into lemonade: Instead of fearing the cannabis revolution, perhaps Vail should embrace it with panache? We could start by allowing only medical marijuana as part of the health and wellness theme!\nBut someone has to be first, so it’s Colorado and Washington state.

But Banach’s research — which comes shortly after a Lancet study that found moderate carbohydrate intake is best for longevity — suggests that weight loss achieved through a low-carb diet may come at the expense of general health, at least when it’s followed for a long period of time.\nThe new study — which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal — used diet and health data from almost 25,000 people collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2010. The researchers found that over an average of 6.4 years of follow-up, people who consumed the lowest amount of carbohydrates had a 32% higher risk of total mortality, a roughly 50% higher risk of dying from vascular diseases and a 36% higher risk of dying from cancer, compared to people who ate the most carbs.\nThe researchers also reviewed seven separate studies on carbohydrates and health, involving around 447,500 people in all. Together, these studies pointed toward similar, if more modest, results. Low-carb diets were associated with a 15% higher risk of total mortality, a 13% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and an 8% higher risk of cancer mortality, compared to high-carb diets.\nIt’s not totally clear why low-carb diets are linked to these health risks, and observational studies like this one can never prove",
        "baseline": " cause-and-effect, only uncover patterns in a particular dataset. But Banach says there are always consequences when cutting out an entire food group, especially if it’s not thoughtfully replaced with healthy alternatives. In the case of carbs, the study says, dieters may run into trouble if they eliminate things like nutritious but carb-heavy fruits, or replace carbohydrates with meat and dairy products. Diets heavy in animal products, versus plant products, may increase a person’s risk of heart disease, and processed meat has been linked to cancer.\nDon’t take that as license to binge on bread, though. Even though low-carb diets appear to come with more risks than high-carb diets, Banach says plenty of existing data, including that from the recent Lancet study, suggests moderation when it comes to carb consumption. Very high-carb diets tend to be heavy on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and snack foods, which are low in nutritional value.",
        "llm_baseline": "lower risk of heart disease and death from any cause.But Banach says that the study’s findings can be explained by the fact that low-carb diets are usually high in saturated fat and protein,which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems.“The main problem with low-carb diets is that low-carb diets are usually high in saturated fat and cholesterol,which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems,” he says.“It is a very dangerous combination.“The study also found that people on low-carb and highcarb diets were associated with a higher risk of death from respiratory diseases,but Banach says that this is probably due to the fact that people with respiratory diseases are more likely to be on low-carb diets than people on highcarb diets in the first place.“Thestudy’s findings are in line with a growing body of research suggesting that low-carb diets may not be the best way to improve your long-term health.A 2018 study published in the Lancet found that people who ate the most carbohydrates had the lowest risk of death from any cause,while a 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that people who ate the least carbohydrates had the highest risk.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

        "prompt": "A political action committee called Nashville Plan \"B\" has brought attention to possible alternatives to the Let's Move Transit Plan.\n\"Don't let politicians convince you there are no alternatives,\" an animated video chimes.\nThe video has made the rounds on social media and advocating for a \"Plan B\" in the Nashville transit debate.\nThe group was formed by two millennials against the city's $5.4 billion transit plan . It was filed as a political action committee with Metro Nashville last week.\n\"We would lease a large fleet of passenger vans then use rideshare technology to create routes instantly based on demand,\" their promotional video states.\nJohann Porisch and John Maddox said they wanted to join the debate but noticed there was something missing from the major anti-transit plan platforms: an alternative.\n\"Instead of inflexible light rail which only runs on one corridor, the van picks people up in front of their homes,\" Porisch said.\nIt's a modern take on vanpooling, which has been in the Midstate since the 1990s.\nNewsChannel 5 Traffic Anchor Rebecca Schleicher rode along with VanStar in August , after the program reached 900 riders across Middle Tennessee. It's run by a federally-funded group and many of its rider fees are covered by companies who want their employees to have a different option to get to work.\nCBS News recently reported on a small fleet of 10 vans that's seen some success in Arlington, Texas where transit options are almost non-existent.\nBut for some, it's a tough sell just three weeks before early voting begins on the citywide transit referendum.\n\"Any idea that someone can come up with a different idea on the back of a napkin is not really realistic,\" said Ethan Link, a volunteer and transit advocate for Transit for Nashville.\nLink works with unions and is constantly in contact with folks in the construction and healthcare industries. He said the city's plan that would build five light rail lines and overhaul the bus system as well as build neighborhood transit centers, sidewalks, bike lanes and cross walks is the best option for Nashville's future.\n\"What I do have confidence in is a well-engineered, well-planned program that the community has had input on, and that's what's on the ballot on May 1,\" he said.\nSo far, the largest rallying cry against the city's plan has been the price, which is $5.4 billion to put in place, but will eventually reach almost $9 billion over the next two decades when the day-to-day operations costs are also factored in.\nTo pay for the plan, the city proposed a series of tax increases. The one Nashville residents will feel the most is the sales tax increase from 9.25 percent to 10.25 percent over the next five years. That tax increase would sunset in 2068.\nA study commissioned by the Nashville Chamber of Commerce said the sales tax impact on an individual in Nashville will be 34 cents a day, or $10 a month. The Chamber has come out in support of the city plan.\n\"We shouldn't have to pay much higher taxes for a transit solution here,\" Porisch said.\nHe said his idea for a 416-van fleet would cost closer to $60 million to run on a daily basis.\nAnother complaint about the city's plan is that it only covers the Metro Nashville area.\n\"Our traffic problems come form Williamson, Rutherford, Sumner counties,\" Porisch pointed out",
        "baseline": ".\nYet, the city plan leaves the option open for surrounding counties to connect by holding referendums of their own.\nCounty mayors are closely watching what happens in Nashville, waiting to make the pitch that raising money to connect to light rail lines and bus routes will benefit their own citizens.\n\"These are the starts of a plan that expands to those other counties and its up to those counties to participate,\" Link said.\nThe guys with Nashville Plan \"B\" argue the city plan is too permanent in a changing world.\n\"Once those steel tracks go down they're never going away,\" Porisch said.\nHe planned to put his proposal on the desks of every Metro Council member Tuesday night before the Council's regularly-scheduled meeting and also provide the plan to the MTA Board.\nHe said he didn't know if city officials would take it seriously, but he hoped they would be open to an alternative plan, because he likes the thought of a Plan B.",

        "prompt": "None of the members of the African Children's Choir wanted to talk about what had happened to them in their homeland of Uganda. That was understandable.\nFew children would want to describe what it was like to watch the brutal murder of their parents.\nThe 24 singers, who spent four months touring Europe and have just begun a one-year tour of the United States, are orphans between the ages of 6 and 13 who were selected from auditions throughout Uganda, a small East Central African country of 14 million and the site of some of the bloodiest civil violence of the past 20 years.\n\"One boy, Ivan, his father was in a store when the soldiers came and wrapped him in cable wire,\" said Jackie McCauley, the choir's director, after a recent performance at the First Presbyterian Church in Inglewood.\n\"The soldiers stabbed him, dragged him back to the house and robbed it. They then took his father away. Ivan never saw him again.\"\nShe said another boy saw his parents shot down in cold blood.\n\"The guerrillas came into the village first and took their food,\" McCauley said. \"Then some soldiers showed up and when there was no food, they accused the village of collaborating with the guerrillas. The soldiers then started shooting randomly and he saw his parents shot as they tried to flee.\"\nAn estimated 500,000 people, almost 4% of the population, died between 1971 and 1985 in a series of wars and purges under dictator Idi Amin and former President Milton Obote.\nBut the horror of the past was not evident as the singing, cheering children marched onto the stage in Inglewood.\nThe church was filled to capacity by an enthusiastic crowd, which was treated to a 90-minute performance that included both tribal and American gospel music. The Christian songs were sung in either English, the official language of Uganda; Luganda, the native tongue, or Swahili, the pan-African language.\nDan Newhall, the pastor of the church, said he found the choir inspiring.\n\"Anybody who felt Inglewood rocking that night, that wasn't an earthquake,\" Newhall said. \"That was the people stomping and clapping at my church.\"\nIn one song, the choir told the story of David and Goliath as two of the boys acted it out. The larger boy towered over the smaller and strutted back and forth. The boy playing David began an exaggerated swinging motion with his arm before slaying Goliath with an imaginary stone from a slingshot, eliciting wild applause from the audience.\nThe choir, sponsored by the Ambassadors of Aid, an interdenominational Christian group, also performed at churches in Long Beach, Redondo Beach and Los Angeles. After the Inglewood performance, the choir left on a tour that includes performances at churches in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Canada and several Midwest and East Coast cities before it returns to the Los Angeles area in December. The money raised will be used to fund six orphanages in Uganda.\nOn the road, the choir travels in its own bus and performs three or four times a week, according to McCauley. Each day's travel is limited to eight hours, she said, and the children stay with families who belong to the churches at which they perform.\n\"It's hectic,\" McCauley said. \"You learn that patience is a virtue. But the children are well disciplined. We make sure they're in line.\"\nMcCauley, a 25-year-old native of Alberta, Canada, said discipline is maintained by using positive reinforcement, not punishment.\n\"These kids have been abused all of their lives,\" McCauley said. \"Many have been tortured. They're used to physical punishment. What they respond to is love.\"\nBecause many of the children, especially the older ones, lack much in the way of a formal education, three accredited teachers travel with the choir and school the children when they are not performing.\n\"We teach them in a manner similar to a correspondence course,\" McCauley said. \"They are tested on an individual basis. For instance, Tom, who is 15 and used to be in the choir and is now our soundman, his level of schooling in Uganda was very low. But through this method, he doesn't feel humiliated and he will eventually finish. If he was back home, they would put him in school with 8-year-olds.\"\nPeter Kasozi, 26, a Ugandan minister who travels with the choir, said distance has helped heal the children's emotional wounds.\n\"The children used to talk about running and hiding from soldiers,\" Kasozi said. \"Now they talk about good things. In California, they've been talking about pizza.\"\nMcCauley said her group's goal is to teach the children about different cultures and help them maintain their own.\n\"We don't have them saying they want to stay here,\" McCauley said. \"What we try to do is open their eyes to what unity in a country can do.\"\nUnity is something that has been in short supply in Uganda's recent history.\nA landlocked country about the size of Oregon, it gained its independence from Great Britain in 1962. In 1966, Obote took power. In 1971 he was overthrown by a coup headed by Amin.\nIn his eight years in power, Amin reportedly ordered the deaths of 300,000 Ugandans, most of whom were suspected of opposing his rule.\n\"During his first few years, Amin was not so bad,\" Kasozi said. \"But when he decided he wanted to become 'President for Life,' he proved to be a bad man.\"\nIn 1979, neighboring Tanzania invaded Uganda to topple Amin, and reinstalled Obote. Obote went on his own reign of terror, and 200,000 more reportedly died then and in the civil war that followed.\nKasozi said the terror of the civil war, which lasted from",
        "baseline": " 1980 until 1985, was what really hurt the children.\n\"The soldiers came to clear villages of the guerrillas (who opposed Obote),\" Kasozi said. \"They had no strategy. They just chose anybody who they suspected of being able to oppose them and they killed them.\"\nObote was overthrown in 1985 and in early 1986 Yoweri Museveni was named president. Despite some remnants of fighting with insurgents loyal to Amin and Obote, the country has returned to relative peace.\nMcCauley said the children have adjusted well to Western life, but have had some trouble coming to terms with what they see on television and in the movies. The children, she said, believe everything they see.\n\"When we were in Europe we showed them two Disney movies, 'Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang' and 'Herbie the Wonderbug,' \" McCauley said.\n\"When we got to America, they were expecting to see flying cars.\"",

Members of the Unite union are also joining the action.\nNearly 900 NHS staff who work in estates and facilities across the Trust’s three hospitals are threatened by the plan to outsource them to the wholly owned subsidiary company, WWL Solutions.\nThey are worried that their terms and conditions could be cut – and that new starters will get inferior pay and pensions, with staff fearing they could all ultimately be moved to a private-sector company.\nThe health workers being transferred tend to be the lowest paid within the NHS, such as porters and cleaners, according to the union.\n“What happens if the new company goes bust? It’s a risk we don’t want to have to take.\n“I’ve never been in this situation before and it’s nerve-wracking and stressful to be going on strike. But we are all determined and staff are being very supportive of one another.\nFreedom of Information requests by Unison found last month that Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust has spent over £154,000 on consultants to create the WWL Solutions subsidiary – in",

These workers love the NHS.\nNHS Trusts across the country are shelling-out huge amounts of money on consultants, with companies advising trusts on the setting up of wholly owned subsidiaries – which staff are then outsourced to.\nThe amount spent by just 15 Trusts in England on setting up these new ‘sub cos’ is already in excess of £3.2 million, according to the FoI requests.\nThe battle against these plans is stepping up, with Labour figures such as Lisa Nandy MP joining the picket lines this week.",

Strain, and serve up with a dash of Angostura bitters for garnish.\nMuddle lime wedges. Build drink over light ice, adding pisco and bitters. Top with ginger beer.\nStir, serve up, garnish with orange peel.\nServe over ice. Top pisco with tonic. Garnish with a citrus wheel.\nMeg McFarland sipped her first pisco sour – a frothy mix of clear Peruvian brandy, sugar, egg whites, bitters and lime juice – in Lima almost 16 years ago.\nAnd she has since made it her mission to help pisco become appreciated around the world.\nMcFarland founded PiscoLogia, a boutique craft pisco distillery, in Peru in 2008. Recently, both PiscoLogia products – Pisco Pura and Pisco Acholado – were picked up by a national distributor that has accounts in most states as well as Washington, D.C. That means it could become easier to find them in her native Inland Northwest.\nMcFarland isn’t the only PiscoLogia partner with a Spokane connection. She runs her company with two other women, one of whom also grew up in Spokane – although the fast friends and business partners didn’t know each other while they were living here.\nKami Kenna, a longtime bartender in Portland who – like McFarland – grew up and graduated from high school in Spokane – won a trip to Peru in a cocktail competition in 2014 and reached out to McFarland over email when she arrived in 2015. She was interested in learning about Latin American spirits, particularly pisco. The two met at a bar in Lima where they discovered that not only were they both from Spokane but they graduated from high school here a year apart.\n“We played basketball at the same time, but we didn’t recognize each other,” said McFarland, who was already living in Lima. She had married a Peruvian in 2013.\nKenna officially joined the company in 2016. Her role is brand ambassador, educator and international sales. She also does social media for PiscoLogia.\nNati Gordillo joined the business about the same time as Kenna. She’s the master distiller, vintner and sommelier.\nBut, “We all do a little bit of everything,” said McFarland, founder and general manager.\nBy the time Gordillo and Kenna came on board, pisco was already enjoying a surge in sales in North America, particularly in larger metropolitan areas. Since 2010, the spirit has been becoming more and more popular in places such as Los Angeles and New York, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland.\nIt hasn’t yet become mainstream in cities the size of Spokane. But both Kenna and McFarland are hoping to see that change.\nPisco is a clear grape brandy that carries protected status, like Champagne. Grapes are harvested at high brix, or sugar content, then distilled in a copper pot still.\nPisco is the national drink of both Chile and Peru. The spirit has a rich, centuries-old heritage in each country. But rules vary.\nIn Chile, more than a dozen different grape varietals from two regions can be used, although just a handful are popular. Chilean pisco can rest in wood. And it can be distilled to a higher proof, which can be brought down with water. The number of times it’s distilled is left up to the distiller.\nThe Peruvian spirit can only be made from eight particular kinds of grapes from five regions. No other ingredient – not even water – is added.\nPeruvian pisco must be aged in a nonreactive container, such as glass or copper, or clay pitchers informally called piscos. Wood isn’t allowed.\nIn either country, pisco can be enjoyed neat – as both an aperitif and digestif. Of course, it can also be mixed in cocktails, such as the Pisco Sour. Infusing pisco with fruits and herbs is also popular. Most restaurants and bars in Peru and Chile offer these house-made macerados, which are used to flavor cocktails.\nDepending on the kind of grapes used, pisco can carry notes of white pepper, chocolate, blueberry, white flowers and more.\nPiscoLogia produces two kinds of pisco: Pisco Pura, made from 100 percent estate-grown Quebranta grapes, and Pisco Acholado, made from a blend of Quebranta and Italia grapes.\nIn Quechua, a native Peruvian language, the word “pisqu” means bird. Pisco is also a port city in Peru and the capital of the Pisco province. The spirit was first exported from here.\nPiscoLogia’s vineyards and distillery are located in Azpitia, about an hour drive south of Lima. But McFarland lives in Curahuasi, about a two-hour drive west of Cusco. There, her husband, Fernando Gonzales-Lattini, owns and operates Apu Winery.\n“He was looking for perfect conditions and he found them in the Andes in the middle of nowhere – so that’s where I am,” said McFarland, 38. They have two children, ages 4 and 5.\nDuring college at the University of Washington, she studied abroad in Granada, Spain. She returned to the UW for her master’s degree, also in Hispanic Literary and Cultural Studies, and owned an alpaca clothing line.\nShe was teaching 100- and 200-level Spanish language classes at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma when she decided to move to Peru. She would like to move back to Spokane – “hopefully,” she said, “in the next two years.” Meantime, she tries to come home to the Inland Northwest twice a year. Most recently, she was here for the holidays.\nKenna, who now lives in Oaxaca, Mexico, visited Spokane in autumn. She had graduated from Mount Spokane High School in 1999, then moved to Portland to attend Portland State University to study Spanish. She bart",

And she specialized in tequila and mezcal cocktails.\nAt PiscoLogia, she said, “we don’t buy grapes. We don’t buy juice.” Their products use only estate-grown grapes.\nAnd that’s just one of the things she appreciates about the business. She’s particularly impressed with the methods of Gordillo, PiscoLogia’s master distiller.\n“She’s by the book, and I think that translates into her product,” Kenna said.\nOn the web: http://piscologia.com/ and https://craftdistillers.com.\nPublished: Jan. 22, 2019, 5 p.m.",

His forthcoming book is: My Father Was a Freedom Fighter: Gaza’s Untold Story (Pluto Press).\nBaroud, whose writings have been praised by Noam Chomsky as “sensitive, thoughtful and searching”, is the chief editor of the Palestine Chronicle, an outstanding online publication dedicated to Palestine issues that enjoys contributions from renowned and prestigious writers from all around the world.\nHe has contributed to Japan Times, the Washington Post, the International Herald Tribune, and Al-Ahram Weekly and will be publishing a new book “Gaza: The Untold Story” with London’s Pluto Press.\nIn this exclusive interview with Foreign Policy Journal, we talked about the latest remarks of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the Durban II anti-racism conference and the subsequent outrages stirred up in the U.S. and Europe, the Holocaust Denial tradition and its impact on Palestine’s cause, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe latest striking controversy surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was the controversial speech of the Iranian President in the UN World Conference Against Racism (Durban II). It actually evoked a series of reflections and responses. Many western diplomats called it “outrageous” and “inadmissible” while the majority of Islamic Scholars and Palestinian authorities lauded it. What do you think about that? What does the public inside Palestine feel about Mr. Ahmadinejad’s remarks?\nIn fact since the Iranian President’s speech, there has been similar criticism of anyone who dares to voice concern regarding Israel’s brutal policies in the occupied territories. The issue is not that President Ahmadinejad uttered “outrageous” comments or not. The true point of contention is the fact that Israel is being criticized in the first place. Since that incident, other such encounters have followed: the rejection of a UN report on Israel’s blatant human rights violations in Gaza, and the fact that the Pope was reportedly upset, and according to Press TV, staged his own walkout, when a Palestinian Muslim scholar called on him to condemn Israeli aggressions, etc. Even if one plays the devil’s advocate, and assumes for a fleeting moment that Ahmadinejad and the Palestinian Sheikh who dared to criticize Israel are indeed “anti-Semitic”, then what would one say to explain the constant criticism leveled at Israel by numerous human rights organizations, former presidents, leading scholars, etc?\nIsrael constantly reduces the debate to that of individuals, not that of its own policies as a way to avoid its responsibility towards international law and the human rights of a subjugated people. Needless to say, Palestinians and many millions around the world are outraged by the double standards practiced by Western governments in dealings with Israel and Muslims, Arabs, and in fact other nations, mostly in the Southern hemisphere, who are still exploitable and lowly regarded. WU members staged a collective walkout over comments made by the Iranian president criticizing Israel, and yet continue to extend a hand of friendship and cooperation towards Israel which has caused indescribable misery to a whole nation; misery that is still ongoing.\nMeanwhile, some critics believe that Iran is forfeiting many of its international advantages and even its homeland security at the cost of defending the Palestinian cause and denouncing Israel. Iran is the most outspoken enemy of Israel on the grounds of defending Palestinians rights. However, the critics believe that Palestinian authorities are showing a reluctant and indifferent approach toward these “sacrifices”, not even bothering themselves to express empathy with Iran in words. What do you believe?\nThese are two different issues, one being Iran’s stance towards Palestine with all of its historic, religious and internal dynamics, and two being the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s stance towards Iran. I will only discuss the latter point.\nThe PA in Ramallah is experiencing an unprecedented challenge to a status quo that was wrought by Oslo and the peace industry which followed. For nearly 16 years, the Oslo culture espoused little political, economic or territorial gains as far as the ordinary Palestinian was concerned. After all of these years, Palestinians continue to be as far away from their political aspirations as they were before the “Peace Process” came into the scene. In fact, in many respects the situation is worse: more land confiscated, more illegal settlements established, etc.\nHowever, not all Palestinians lost out; a few benefited, and accumulated unprecedented wealth and prestige. Those gains were outcomes of the mere “process” itself. In other words, the “peace process” for them, became an end in itself; it espoused a status quo that, over the years, a ruling Palestinian elite learned to live with, and benefit from. That elite is now based in Ramallah, its jurisdiction is largely limited to distributing international aid to friends and cronies.\nThe elite’s problem with Hamas is neither religious, nor political, nor even ideological. It’s merely the fear that any change to the status quo will result in tremendous losses, mostly financial. Also, those who thrive on corruption are most fearful when a non-corrupt body take over and threaten to govern by the law and bring about accountability, which could also mean courts, trials and jail terms.\nIt’s from this point of view that the PA is most distressed when it sees Iran taking a lead in pushing for a change in the status quo regarding Palestine. However, the PA position, while is most belligerent in the case of Iran, has been consistent regarding any entity that voices any criticism of the PA’s conduct, voices support for the democratically elected government of Hamas, or dares to chastise the PA for its human rights violations and subservience to Israel. Threatened regimes tend to be extremely sensitive and reactionary when it comes to outside criticism.\nThe other issue is the custom of Holocaust denial being underscored by Mr. Ahmadinejad. Denying the Holocaust, despite having been a long-term tradition, went under the global spotlight after his fervent remarks in early 2005. Mahmoud Abbas is also branded as a Holocaust denier. What do you think about this issue? Does it make any impact on the betterment of Palestinians’ situation to question the Holocaust?\nTo be clear, denying such a terrible crime against humanity is certainly unethical, to say the least.\nThat said, when the crimes of the Holocaust are discussed, the discussion almost immediately becomes two pronged: one of the Holocaust as a despicable crime against humanity, which should be duly remembered – as not to be repeated against any other nation – and the memory of those who perished in that most dreadful time in history should also be recalled. But there is also another Holocaust discussion, one that is hardly concerned with the plight of humanity and the dignity of people. It’s not about remembrance and is scarcely pertinent to issues concerning human rights. The second reference to the Holocaust is always used in political contexts, often infused to justify vile human rights violations against other nations, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese, and utilized as a pretext to infringe about the sovereignty of other nations, like Iraq, and now Iran.\nTherefore, any discussion of the Holocaust is very central to the current political discussion of the Middle East: Israel in Palestine, Israel vs. Iran, etc. One must learn to distinguish between the Holocaust as a terrible war crime and that which Norman Finkelstein poignantly depicts as the “Holocaust industry”, which is the Israeli, Zionist manipulation of the Nazi’s genocide to achieve specific political goals, which ironically, contributes to further violations of human rights.\nThe short answer is that without discerning the difference between the actual Holocaust, and the terrible manipulation of the memory of its victims, this sensitive subject would hardly be beneficial to the Palestinian people and their rightful struggle for freedom.\nAnd finally, what do you think about the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Should the Palestinians eventually brace themselves for a “two-state solution”, or is there any practical agenda to adopt a one-state way out?\nI am not sure if one can still earnestly discuss a two-state “solution”. Israel has created enough facts on the ground that makes such a formula utterly unworkable. I believe that maintaining the two state solution ruses is part and parcel of maintaining the greater ruse of the so-called peace process. The peace process is fundamentally based on the notion that the ultimate outcome of the process is two states for two people. To accept the fact that two states option is no longer possible, is to demolish the entire peace process discourse, which is terrifying to those who have invested much time and resources in maintaining it. If there is no two-state option, thus no peace process, then the discussion would have to be refocused on:",
        "baseline": " co-existence based on a one-state formula, which demolishes the very premise behind the Zionist vision for Israel, that of racial superiority and political exclusivism to one single race. One-state means the abolishing of the racist discourse of Zionism and restructuring the state based on a secular, democratic model. Neither Israel nor the West is ready to entertain such a prospect. But they are equally unready to accept the fact that a viable Palestinian state is no longer possible. This is a bind that was created by Israel itself, financed and defended by the U.S. and Western governments. These parties still refuse to face the facts, and insist on maintaining a charade that shall yield nothing but further conflict.\n– Kourosh Ziabari is an Iranian media correspondent, freelance journalist and the author.

The general public's opinion of the bill that authorized the government to spend $787 billion to create jobs and end the recession is that it has been a dud. According to a recent CNN poll, nearly three-quarters of Americans think that at least half the money spent has been wasted. Economists and policy watchers have a higher but still mixed opinion of the bill.\nMost agree that it has created jobs, and the government can specifically point to 600,000 of them. Tax cuts, the extension of unemployment benefits and other measures that didn't directly lead to new hires also boosted the economy. Overall, economic forecasters such as Moody's Economy.com and IHS Global Insight say the bill generated paychecks for anywhere from 1.5 million to 2 million people who would have been out of work this past year without the stimulus.\nBut what makes the bill's success hard to judge is that it was oversold. Before the stimulus was passed, a report from President Obama's economic advisers predicted that the bill would ensure that the unemployment rate would remain at 8% or below. By that estimate, the bill looks like a failure. A few months ago, the unemployment rate hit 10%; currently it is 9.7%.\nAnother problem is that the bill included a huge jumble of programs. How do you evaluate the $10,090 of stimulus money that was spent in Ely, Nev., to build a fence to keep cattle off a highway? Drivers, and the cattle, most likely appreciate it, but did building that fence really stimulate the economy?\nWhat's more",
        "baseline": ", one year out, much of the money allocated by the bill has yet to be spent. Just $272 billion has been put into the economy. So with two-thirds of the stimulus' power untapped, it is hard to say what the final outcome will be.\nEven so, a number of the programs the bill did sponsor seem to have been successes. But what is clear is that keeping people employed was costly. Even if you take the high end of the employment estimates  2 million jobs  the government has spent $140,000 per job created. Surely, we should be able to employ people for less. \"If you put that much government resources into the economy, you are going to boost GDP,\" says Vincent Reinhart, resident scholar at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute and a former top Federal Reserve economist. \"But I don't think we got a lot out of it.\"\nHere is a rundown of a few stimulus programs and how they turned out.",

        "prompt": "OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 30, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Chabot Astronomers are tracking the latest supernova about 12 million light years away. Identified as \"2014J,\" a Type 1A supernova, the phenomenon is occurring in Messier-82 (M82), also known as the Cigar Galaxy. Supernovae occur when a star explodes emitting a massive amount of energy in a short span of time; the star literally collapses under its own gravity. 2014J actually exploded about 12 million years ago, but is only visible now because of the distance its light has had to travel through space.\nAll Type 1A supernovae have the same intrinsic brightness, so are very useful tools for astronomers in determining the distance to the galaxies in which they explode. By measuring the apparent brightness of the supernova and comparing it to what we know the true brightness of a Type 1A supernova to be, astronomers can calculate the distance with good accuracy.\nChabot astronomer and astrophotographer Conrad Jung, and his team are tracking and photographing 2014J through Chabot's 36\" reflecting research telescope Nellie and comparing to images taken ten years ago. Astronomer Gerald McKeegan stated, \"Although the supernova was discovered on January 21st, researchers have determined that the initial explosion occurred on January 14. For Type 1A supernovae, the luminosity ramp-up typically takes 18 to 20 days, so it should reach maximum brightness around February 2nd. Thereafter, it will gradually fade, losing about 2 magnitudes in luminosity by the end of February. If the 18-20 day luminosity ramp up profile holds true for SN 2014J, then it should be just about at maximum magnitude this coming weekend February 1st and 2nd.\"\nNellie will be pointed at SN 2014J for public viewing this weekend, weather permitting.

        "prompt": "Canada's World Cup dreams were snuffed out in brutal fashion Tuesday as Honduras put them to the sword 8-1 in a do-or-die qualifying match.\nIt's a bitter pill to swallow for a Canadian team that went into the match with its fate in its own hands and the unswerving belief that it deserved to move on. That is until Tuesday, when the wheels came off the Canadian bus in a shocking display.\nCanada entered the hostile confines of a soldout Estadio Olimpico Metropolitano knowing that a tie or win would be enough to move on to the final round of qualifying in the CONCACAF region, which covers North and Central America and the Caribbean. The Hondurans, looking to please their fans on an extended national holiday, needed a win.\nAsked if the moment had got to his team, Canadian coach Stephen Hart offered a one-word answer — \"Yes.\n\"You're supposed to go down all guns blazing, you're supposed to fight,\" he added. \"You're supposed to die out there.\n\"We were horrible. ... It's disturbing to me that the team fell apart.\"\nIt was Canada's worst loss since an 8-0 drubbing in Mexico in 1993.\n\"We pretty much embarrassed ourselves,\" said midfielder Julian de Guzman.\n\"We were terrible ... It's an absolute low for us,\" added captain Kevin McKenna.\nHonduras's speed and clinical finishing — combined with Canada's clown-like defending — ended the suspense very early, racking up four goals in a 25-minute span to lead 4-0 after just 32 minutes. The Central Americans made it look easy against a sluggish Canadian side that simply wasn't up to the challenge.\nIt was men against boys.\n\"We let in goals early and fell apart. Mentally and physically,\" said Hart.\nJerry Bengston and Carlo Costly each scored three goals for Honduras, while Mario Martinez added two of his own.\nSubstitute Iain Hume scored a consolation goal off a nice free kick in the 76th minute before Bengston restored the six-goal cushion six minutes later as the Canadian defence crumbled around him. Costly then scored on an 88th-minute header to complete the rout.\nHart said personally he thought he had done his best but could have to consider his future in the wake of the \"crushing\" result.\n\"All I can do is ask the fans' forgiveness on behalf of the players,\" said the coach, who has six months remaining on his contract. \"I know they'll never forgive me but on behalf of the players, forgive them.\"\nReminded he was not on the field, Hart said: \"It's my responsibility.\"\nMcKenna disagreed, saying blame should not be laid at the coach's feet.\n\"It was all to do with the players. Stephen Hart had us well prepared for every game that we've gone into, at least since I've been with this national team,\" he said. \"It would be a same if they point the finger at the coach. It was all the players.\n\"We drew Honduras in Canada and we should have won that game. To come down here and to lose 8-1 is devastation.\"\nBut someone will likely have to pay for this disaster.\nA Canadian Soccer Association spokesman said immediately after the game that president Victor Montagliani would not speak to the media until he had a chance to talk with Hart first.\nIt was the worst start possible for Canada, forced on the back foot almost from the get go after Tosaint Ricketts was unable to get a foot on the ball from in front of goal just after the opening kickoff.\nThe Hondurans scored in the seventh minute as McKenna and then fellow centre back Andre Hainault failed to corral a high, awkward bouncing ball. Bengston went through the middle and got a foot to the ball to poke it in.\nThe Honduran forward disappeared in a sea of teammates before emerging to look at the crowd and pound the 'H' on his jersey.\nSimeon Jackson almost tied it up minutes later, but his shot hit the post and goalie Donis Escobar saved the rebound chance from Ricketts.\nThe second goal came in the 16th minute after de Guzman was dispossessed in midfield. Martinez's shot was stopped by Lars Hirschfeld but Bengston was all alone to tap in the rebound.\nCostly made it 3-0 in the 28th on a diving header after Bengston played provider, heading a cross back across goal that an outstretched Hirschfeld was unable to get to.\nMartinez then made it 4-0 in the 32nd minute, poking the ball through a Canadian defender's legs at the edge of the penalty area and then stroking a shot home to cap off an effortless attack that started deep in Honduras territory.\nThe Honduran goal bonanza continued early in the second half as Martinez sent in a cross that Costly headed past Hirschfeld in the 48th with ease.\nMartinez twisted the knife further with a beautifully curled shot from just outside the penalty box in the 59th minute, upping the lead to 6-0. The crowd went wild, again.\n\"There's no excuse. No excuse,\" Hart said. \"Everybody said they were good to go. They trained well. Individually we fell apart defensively. The first three goals were basically given to them and it was over.\"\nTuesday's showdown came in a country infamous for the highest per capita murder rate in the world and a city known as the most violent on the planet. Guns are everywhere with citizens allowed up to five firearms per person.\nThe game was supervised by a FIFA security expert from Europe, called in by Canada after concerns about fan harassment at its hotel in Panama. There were no such problems at the hotel here.\nMore than 400 police were expected at the stadium to marshall the 40,000-capacity stands and the San Pedro Sula police chief told both teams at a meeting Monday that spectators would not be allowed to bring weapons into the stadium.\nA handful of police stood along the sidelines, leaning on their riot shields prior to the match as the Canadians came out for their warmup. In the stands, fans stood two or three deep in the aisles.\nMike Klukowski came in for the ailing Ante Jazic while Nik Ledgerwood was in for suspended striker Olivier Occean, playing a more defensive role in midfield.\nJackson was the lone striker up front.\nBuilt in 1997, the venue is a crumbling eyesore with barbed wire and a dry moat around the fenced-in pitch.\nThree hours before kickoff, the stadium was a cacophony of noise with horns drowning out the public address system. But the stadium announcer did his best to be heard above the din, yelling \"Honduras, Honduras, Honduras\" repeatedly in a bid to ramp up the din.\nThe main stands at the crumbling stadium were a sea of blue-and-white.\nFortunately for those in attendance, there was some cloud cover to take the edge of 30-degree-plus heat. But the sweat still dripped in rivers.\nThere were dancing girls, drummers and giant puppets. And that was before the players even came out.\nThe Canadians walked onto the pitch in tracksuits about 75 minutes before kickoff to chants of \"Honduras, Honduras.\" Several of the Canadians applauded the amped-up crowd.\nFifteen minutes before kickoff, the crowd was doing the wave and yelling \"Ole, Ole.\"\nLa Prensa, the local newspaper, printed a 12-page special on the game with a front-page cartoon of an anxious looking Canadian being tossed in a frying pan in the shape of the stadium while a Honduran player looked on. \"You're toast,\" ran the caption.\nThe paper also promised on its front cover that 38,000 people in the stadium and eight million around the country will be urging their team on with the \"sacred\" cheer of \"Honduras, Honduras, Honduras.\"\n\"Football is like the happiness in this country,\" explained Wilfredo, who works at the hotel where the Canadians were staying, \"because we have many troubles.\"\nCanada foundered at this very stadium four years ago, losing 3-1 in a game that eliminated it from advancing.\n\"It's going to stay with me a long time,\" added McKenna.\nThe Canadians have not made the final round of qualifying in CONCACAF since 1997 when they went 1-6-3 to finish last.\nCanada's only trip to the World Cup came in 1986, when it failed to win or score a goal.\nIn the other Group C game Tuesday, Panama (3-1-2) drew Cuba (0-5-1) 1-1 and finished first in the group.\nThis qualifying round went fairly smoothly for Hart's team. Canada took maximum points from Cuba and defeated Panama 2-0 at BMO Field. But the team failed to convert scoring chances in a 0-0 home tie with Honduras and underperformed in a 2-0 loss in Panama City.\nHart's offence sputtered for much of the round, a problem that was exacerbated when playmaker Dwayne De Rosario went down in Panama with a long-term knee",
        "baseline": " injury. There was no shortage of chances, but the finishing wasn't there. Prior to last Friday's 3-0 win over a weakened visiting Cuban side, the Canadians had scored just two goals in four matches, trying them with Antigua and Barbuda for second worst in the round.\nDefence had been sound, however, prior to the San Pedro Sula collapse. Canada has posted shutouts in four of the five matches in this round.\nCanada is currently ranked 61st in the world by FIFA. Honduras is No. 66, while Panama is No. 43 and Cuba in No. 146.\nCanada's rating puts it sixth in CONCACAF, one spot ahead of Honduras.\nThe Hondurans have made the World Cup twice, in 1982 and 2010.\nCBCSports.ca's first version of the recap indicated that David Edgar, a Canadian, was a goal scorer for Honduras. It was in fact an own goal credited to Carlo Costly of Honduras.",

Since 2005, there have been 180 major attacks against aid workers in Afghanistan, 150 in Sudan and 100 in Somalia, according to the report released this week called \"To Stay and Deliver.\"\nThe increased violence comes amid a proliferation of nongovernmental aid groups, including 280 in Afghanistan, said former U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland, who along with two security experts conducted the report for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nForeign workers have faced outrage in Afghanistan since a Florida pastor burned a copy of the Koran last month. The Koran burning sparked a deadly protest April 1 in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif in which gunmen stormed a U.N. compound, killing three U.N. staff members and four Nepalese guards.\n\"There are no places on Earth where humanitarian organizations should not go or cannot go,\" Egeland, now director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said Tuesday during a press conference in New York. \"Instead of asking what does it take to leave, we should ask what does it take to stay in Mazar-i-Sharif and other such places. Risk management means you adapt to the circumstances.\"\nDan McNorton, a spokesman for the U.N. in Afghanistan, said the report reflected the increased security risks the world body's staff has faced in recent years.\n\"Physical security measures are of course vital, but there are also other steps we take to ensure the security of our personnel,\" McNorton said, including, \"maintaining our relationships with local people.\"\nEgeland said the report, based on interviews with more than 250 aid workers, shows the importance of granting aid workers access to all parties to a conflict, including the Taliban.\nHe praised the International Committee of the Red Cross but criticized what he called the \"bunkerization, politicization and militarization\" of other humanitarian workers in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where some aid groups have hired armed guards",
        "baseline": " and accepted military funding for counterinsurgency work, putting other humanitarian organizations at risk of attack, he said.\nAid agencies should consider hiring local plainclothes police officers, taxis, or unmarked cars, the report suggests, and focus on becoming \"more professional, more disciplined and more principled in how they act and how they enforce principles and standards in high-risk circumstances.\"\nSanta Monica-based International Medical Corps has worked in Afghanistan since 1984, but as security has deteriorated, staff members have struggled to maintain their reputation for neutrality, said spokeswoman Margaret Aguirre.\n\"We are seen as a soft target by people who do not want to see communities succeed or who believe that just because we are a foreign NGO we are linked to the foreign policies of Western countries,\" Aguirre said.\n\"But we have managed to deal with it so far by increasing the community's acceptance of us and knowledge of what we do, increasing community participation in our work and keeping a low profile.\"",

The FBI assisted state and local authorities in the manhunt.\nPrince was “apprehended a short time ago in Delaware by ATF and allied law enforcement agencies,” the Harford County Sheriff’s Office in Maryland tweeted Wednesday night.\nAuthorities said it wasn’t clear why Prince open fired with a handgun on his colleagues.\nPrince is a felon with 42 arrests in Delaware.

He also faced charges of being a felon in possession of a gun, was habitually late paying his rent, was repeatedly cited for traffic violations and was ordered to undergo drug and alcohol counseling in recent years.\nThe rampage began Wednesday about 9 a.m. at the Emmorton Business Park in Edgewood, Harford County, Maryland, Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said. Deputies arrived in four minutes but Prince had already fled.\nKevin Doyle of Thornhill Properties said he was getting tools from his truck when he heard screaming and saw three men running from the office park. The men told him someone was shooting and he asked if they had called 911. They said no, even though, Doyle said, they had phones in their hands.\n“I think they were just so scared, they didn’t (call 911). They had a look of terror,” he said.\nThe victims and the suspect worked for Advanced Granite Solutions, which designs and installs countertops, the company owner told The Associated Press. Prince has been an employee for four months, working as a machine operator, owner Barak Caba told AP in a brief telephone interview. Caba was shaken and would not provide additional details.\nThe victim was shot in the vicinity of his head and once in the body but was expected to survive.\nPolice followed Prince briefly, but they lost him and haven’t seen or heard from him since, the chief said. On Wednesday night, police in Delaware said Prince’s car had been found unoccupied, a spokeswoman said.\nPrince was fired from JPS Marble and Granite earlier this year and scared his previous employer so badly that he tried to get a restraining order in February.\nA Harford County District Court judge denied the order, saying the case didn’t meet the required burden of proof.\nInvestigators were treating the shooting as a case of workplace violence and didn’t see ties to terrorism, said Dave Fitz, a spokesman for the Baltimore FBI field office.\nSince November 2014, Prince has rented a three-bedroom town house in Elkton — about 35 miles (56 kilometers) from the",

However, the charges were dropped about three months later. It’s not clear why.\nWilmington, Delaware, police said Prince had 15 felony convictions there. In King County, Washington, in 2014, he was cited for leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended license, according to Komonews.com.\nCourt records also showed that he was required to undergo drug and alcoholism counseling at the time.\nPrince racked up four traffic citations in King County in 2012 and 2013, mostly for speeding.",

        "prompt": "Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nBy Louis Jacobson on Wednesday, October 5th, 2016 at 12:43 a.m.\nTim Kaine claimed that Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\" Mostly False.\nDuring the vice presidential debate, Tim Kaine deployed a longstanding Democratic talking point against his Republican rivals -- that Republicans can’t wait to privatize Social Security.\nKaine said, \"Here's what Hillary (Clinton) and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.\"\nPence’s response was that \"all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it.\" Kaine countered, \"Go read the book.\"\nKaine’s wording was careful, but he left a clear impression that Trump would privatize the retirement program while Kaine and Clinton would protect the existing system.\nAs it turns out, Kaine is on target with the reference to a Ponzi scheme in Trump’s book. But it’s a big stretch for Kaine to use a 16-year-old book as evidence that the Trump-Pence ticket would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nAs we’ve noted before, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement.\nThe upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security.\nThe downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program.\nThe most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into \"personal retirement accounts.\" Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation.\nA few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress.\nThese two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the \"third rail\" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates.\nFor this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term \"privatization\" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology.\nIn Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, he directly compares Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. \"The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,\" Trump writes at one point. \"The pyramids are made of papier-mache.\"\nHe also wrote in the book, according to BuzzFeed, \"This is the second year Social Security benefits have been paid. The first recipients of Social Security, even once inflation was factored in, got the equivalent of a 36.5 percent annual interest rate on their initial contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund. For those retiring in 1956, their inflation-adjusted rate of return was still a respectable 12 percent. Julie Kosterlitz, in the National Journal, compares that figure with this: For those who are working now and looking to retire after 2015, their returns will be below 2 percent. And that’s if they ever get paid at all. Does the name Ponzi all of a sudden come to mind?\"\nIn his book, Trump proposed allowing \"every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches.\"\nSo Kaine has a point that Trump once supported partial privatization of Social Security and called it a Ponzi scheme. But that was 16 years ago, and the Clinton campaign did not provide us with any more recent evidence after the debate concluded.\nSo what about Trump’s position today?\nAs we’ve reported, Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. He’s also been fairly consistent during the campaign -- a statement we can’t make about other policy issues.\nIn September 2015, he said on CBS’ 60 Minutes, \"What I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we’re going to save it without increases. We’re not going to raise the age and it will be just fine.\"\nHe told a crowd in Georgia in February, \"We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts.",
        "baseline": " Mark my words.\"\nHe also responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program.\n\"If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being,\" he said.\nKaine said that Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nKaine cited an old stance, but it needs updating. Back in 2000, Trump did support privatization and call Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But now, 16 years later, Trump has offered relatively vague -- but relatively consistent -- statements that support keeping the structure of the program as is, without enacting changes as significant as private accounts.\nPublished: Wednesday, October 5th, 2016 at 12:43 a.m.",

Just another plant, swaying prettily with the breeze.\nBut if you were to fight your way through a mature thicket of phragmites, you’d be hard-pressed not to ascribe to them a malevolent personality.\nTheir dense root system emits two toxins that choke out rival plants; the tight-packed stems crowd out nutrition and space for any other living thing; and just one shoot can spread to become hundreds in a single season.\nYou can burn them, drown them, poison them, cut them, crush them and they will still resist extermination.\nBut a decade after phragmites (pronounced frag-MY-tees, both singular and plural) was named Canada’s worst invasive plant, community groups in the front lines of eradication efforts are still beating the bushes for funding from provincial ministries, municipalities, agencies, cottager associations and environmental and conservation bodies.\nAnd, most frustrating to area phrag-fighters, is that a herbicide that’s used successfully as a control tool elsewhere is not permitted in Ontario wetlands.\n\"It’s just such a massive, massive undertaking,\" says wetland biologist Janice Gilbert, founder of the Ontario Phragmites Working Group and the expert other experts turn to for advice. \"The shame of it is that it’s got this far.\"\nGilbert has been called upon to advise on and help manage phragmites at Long Point, and all along the Lake Erie coastline, in Lake Huron and Lake Ontario communities and as far north as Thunder Bay.\nThey’ve thrown virtually every tool at the plant: chopping it far below the waterline to starve it of oxygen, applying herbicide during the dry season, rolling over it and doing a controlled burn.\nBut, Gilbert said, \"We’re fighting with our hands tied behind our backs.\"\nThe herbicide they use is approved only under certain conditions, on dry land.\nBut Michigan, British Columbia and Alberta have approved and are using a herbicide (usually applied by helicopter) that’s safe to use against in-water phragmites.\nMPP Monte McNaughton (PC — Lambton-Kent-Middlesex) wants Ontario to also approve its use.\nHe also wants the province to declare phragmites a noxious weed, which would permit officials to go on private land to control it. He has asked the province to step up existing efforts to get rid of phragmites along roadsides and in ditches and has offered new Natural Resources Minister Kathryn McGarry a tour of problem sites.\n\"Phragmites is a growing environmental and economic threat to Ontario and we have to deal with it as quickly as possible,\" McNaughton said.\nThe province is fighting against 441 different invasive-plant species and its strategic plan against them includes prevention, detection, response, management, adaptation and collaboration. Much of its phragmites work has included researching and mapping it and, since 2007, working with other groups to fund its removal.\nThat includes projects such as the Lambton Shores Phragmites Community Group, led by Nancy Vidler.\nIn 2008, Vidler discovered the plant that had begun to invade the beach and crowd the rare coastal meadow/Carolinian ecosystem near her home had just three years earlier been named by Agriculture Canada the worst of the worst invasive plants.\nShe mobilized neighbours and municipal leaders and got enough funding for an extensive cleanup there and all along the shoreline. Nearby Kettle and Stony Point First Nation did the same and now several area municipalities also are working to control the weed in waterways and ditches.\nCleanup costs have run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nNow native lilies grow in patches here, crayfish nests have emerged, a kingfisher dives into the water over there — all where a nearly impregnable wall of phragmites stood only two years ago.\nKeeping on top of it is more than a one-year, one-committee, one-government job, said Vidler, who is so passionate about the project that her licence plate reads PHRAGLDY and she received hip waders as a Christmas gift.\nEven with committed local people using the best available science, there are still large \"orphaned\" areas that are too wet or where property ownership is too muddled for adequate treatment measures.\nAnd that means a risk the untreated areas will encroach into the treated ones.\n\"See that cell?\" Vidler said, first pointing to a few stalks poking up near shore, and then to 40 hectares that have yet to be treated along the Lake Huron waterfront near Kettle Point. \"That’s just small, and then the shoots go out and then all of a sudden, boom, it’s like that and people say, \"Where is our coastline?\"\"\nShe said collaboration has been key. \"You can’t expect that one group is going to pay for the cost or do the work. We’ve found that the best approach is working with the partners to get rid of it.\"\nVidler and the municipality aim to eliminate phragmites here by 2020.\nSo does St. Thomas, where a phrag-fighting team has become a committee of city council.\nWith an annual budget of $13,000, St. Thomas hopes to have treated most areas of the city by the end of this year, said David Collins, chairperson of the Phragmites Control Committee.\n\"Nothing lives or eats or nests in phragmites,\" he said.\nHomeowners around Lake Margaret once couldn’t see the water from their backyards. Now, there are only scattered strands of it. \"The turtle ponds are already returning to life.\"\nBut many believe Ontario is losing the phragmites war in spite of many successful battles.\nProjections by Gilbert and others — including a study commissioned by Great Lakes mayors that used NASA satellite imagery — suggest small pockets of plants will multiply exponentially and already large areas will only grow unless there’s a concerted eradication effort.\nAnd that will ultimately mean habitats are lost, species-at-risk become endangered, property values drop and fields become flood-prone when drainage ditches become clogged.\n\"A lot of people that are in the urban areas",
        "baseline": " . . . see it in the ditches and say, \"Oh, well,\"\" said Vidler. \"But they (need to) recognize that this is where it all ends up.\"\nGilbert is hopeful that with the proper tools — including the right herbicides, judiciously applied — this can be knocked back to something manageable in five to seven years.\nAnd though that may sound optimistic when she daily sees hundreds of hectares of the stuff from Long Point to Windsor, from Erieau to Thunder Bay, \"I have to be (optimistic). You have to be, otherwise you would just give up.\"\nInvasive plant originating in Eurasia and causing damage to Ontario’s wetlands and beaches.\nSpreads quickly and out-competes native plants both by its sheer density and its roots that emit a toxin that kills surrounding plants.\nProvides poor habitat for wildlife.\nIncreases fire hazards and can impede swimming, boating, angling, farming.",

A Hong Kong man, believed to be the woman's partner, was treated in hospital for scratches, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\"Her body (was) found at 10.30am some 500m from the accident site,\" said Mr Thanakorn Pattananun, the head of the island's tourist police.\nA team of 50 rescue workers in seven boats was scouring the area for a British man who was still missing, he said.\nThe Thai captain of the Ang Thong Explorer speedboat was detained and charged with negligence leading to deaths and injuries.\n\"Weather was the cause of the accident because it created high waves, but the boat was also being driven at a high speed,\" said Mr Apichart Boonsriro, commander of the Surat Thani provincial police.\nFour tourists - from Britain, Australia, Germany",

A spokesman said they were aware of another British national in hospital for injuries suffered in the same incident, but did not make reference to a third citizen.\n\"We remain in contact with the local authorities in Thailand for further information,\" she said.\nThe German Embassy in Bangkok was not available to comment.\nTourism is a key source of revenue for Thailand, but accidents involving tourists are common in a country where safety regulations are often weakly enforced.\nIn January, a speedboat struck and instantly killed a French tourist while she was snorkelling in waters reserved for swimmers off a Thai island in Krabi province.",

Democracy's messy so that's the way it goes,” she said. “But everybody eat ahead of time, apparently. Don't let your blood sugar drop.\"\nAhead of Saturday’s caucuses, people are worrying about something really going wrong here in Las Vegas. First the party was concerned about having enough volunteers. Now, conspiracy theories abound, and the fear that Nevada will look like the mess earlier this month in Iowa is haunting both Democratic campaigns. In Iowa, the complicated structure and tight result led to the image of an election being decided by a series of coin flips.\nNobody wants Nevada to look like that, and state campaign officials bristle at the suggestion Iowa is a preview of the Nevada caucuses.\nBut everyone else has something to worry about.\nClinton supporters were chattering Friday about rumored Republican efforts to take advantage of a loophole in the system to register and caucus with the Democrats for Bernie. The state party and the Nevada Secretary of state warned that Republicans attempting to pretend they’re Democrats to caucus could disqualify them from caucusing with the GOP next week.\nMeanwhile, the Sanders campaign, burned by an Iowa caucus process they still say wasn’t fair, has built a robust “election protection program” for Bernie volunteers to fall back on if things go sideways. The system was built, based in part, on lessons learned in Iowa: It includes a handful of attorneys on hand and a hotline for Sanders precinct captains — the trained Sanders partisans on hand to wrangle the rest of his supporters during the raucous caucus process. The team includes experts on the Nevada system, ready to pounce and contest things they think are not going well.\nCaucus are always hotbeds of partisan conspiracy, but after Iowa, things are even more torqued up than usual. Part of it is Nevada and the craziness of last time. In 2008, Clinton won the popular vote, but President Obama won the most delegates. That led to headlines declaring two Democratic winners — something that still stings here, and has led many to expect a less-than-smooth Saturday once caucusing gets rolling.\nChris Newman, a lawyer and immigration activist from Los Angeles who once monitored a Hugo Chavez election in Venezuela in 2007, is coming to Las Vegas in his personal capacity to monitor the polls.\nHe said he doesn’t personally suspect foul play from Clinton, but said \"widespread reporting\" that a number of precincts came down to coin tosses in Iowa contributed to concern that there could be attempts to game the system, which would lead to distrust over the results.\n“You could see that there were a lot of concerns and even some conspiracy theories about what happened in Iowa and this is the best way to avoid that type of situation and ensure the legitimacy of the process,” he said.\nThe central report in recent days has been that the Sanders campaign is calling lists of Republican voters and telling them to change their registration and vote Saturday in the Democratic caucus, according to a source familiar with the Clinton operation in the state.\n“They are the ones inviting Republicans,” the source said.\nAndres Ramirez, a Nevada superdelegate and longtime Democratic operative who endorsed Clinton at a rally Thursday after the MSNBC/Telemundo town hall, said that — if it’s true — the Sanders campaign is within its rights to do what it’s doing, but is misinforming Republican voters.\nRamirez, who is helping the Nevada Democratic Party",
        "baseline": " on Saturday, said the list of voters for the Republican caucus was locked in on Feb. 13, 10 days before the GOP’s caucus. While those Republicans can indeed change their registration and take part in the Democratic caucus Saturday, he said they will not be able to then turn around and vote in the Republican one.\n“I’ve talked to the elections department and the Secretary of State, that’s not true,” he said.\nBut he said the Sanders campaign is the one recruiting lawyers to come and “protect voting rights,” calling the effort “bizarre.” He said a caucus is not like a primary, there will be no casting ballots on a voting machine, and Democrats have same-day registration.\nPundits were already declaring the Nevada caucus a failure hours before they began, citing the swirling rumors and the Sanders campaign request that a volunteer be at each site recording the caucus in case later review is needed.",

(AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday that a Georgia sheriff is violating the rights of jail inmates by prohibiting them from receiving outside books and magazines.\nThe ACLU sent a letter to Chatham County Sheriff John Wilcher urging him to rescind a new policy that says inmates at the county jail in Savannah can no longer receive books or magazines by mail or from visitors. The policy restricts inmates to selecting reading materials from book carts managed by jail staff.\n\"We have never before encountered a policy that so completely restricts detained persons' access to books and publications,\" said the letter signed by David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project, and attorneys from the ACLU of Georgia.\nThe letter dated Wednesday noted the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment grants inmates not only freedom of speech but also the \"freedom to read.\"",

Attached were copies of the book policy and a notice alerting inmates that the changes were taking effect March 3.\n\"I think I'm well within the scope of the law,\" Wilcher said in a phone interview. \"If I'm not, then I'll change my policy.\"\nThe sheriff said inmates are able to choose books and magazines divided among eight carts, one for each of the jail's housing wings. Inmates also have access to copies of the Bible, the Quran and other religious texts through the jail's chaplains, he said.\nThe sheriff declined to discuss the book policy further, saying he's still awaiting legal advice from county attorneys.\nR. Jonathan Hart, the county attorney, did not immediately return a phone message.\nThe Chatham County jail housed an average of 1,630 inmates per day in 2016, according to a report on jail operations on the sheriff's website.",

        "prompt": "I bet it has been twenty years since I had a meal at the Red Sails Inn. Today two members of my widow support group – Irene and Candy – and I decided to get together for brunch and go up to the cemetery to visit our spouses. We usually go somewhere in Ocean Beach, but wanted something different this time so, after looking at the “Beacon” list of top restaurants, we decided to try the Red Sails Inn.\nThe first thing I noticed was that the “musty” smell that I remember from twenty years ago was gone. The restaurant hadn’t changed much nor had the menu. The breakfast menu consisted of approximately 20 items, plus a number of different kinds of omelets and side dishes. The price range was from $4.95- $11.95. The lunch menu had 8 kinds of burgers, 13 different sandwiches, 2 soups, and an array of seafood dishes, as well as salads.\nCandy was not as hungry and she ordered a bowl of steaming hot clam chowder – $3.95 – and a bowl of coleslaw for $1.75. She said that both the chowder and coleslaw was good.\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict – $9.95 – and had my choice of hash brown potatoes or homemade fries. I first ordered the hash browns, crispy, but later changed the order to fruit instead of potatoes. When my order arrived, the switch had not taken place and there were very crispy hash browns on the plate. Debra quickly brought me a bowl of fruit, and left the potatoes.\nWe were a little concerned that three people that came into the restaurant after us placed their order at least 6 minutes after we placed ours. They were served first – different waitress – and we were prepared to have our order served to us cold. That was not the case. Even though the three ahead of us were almost finished with their meal before we were served, our food was hot and tasty. The ham on my Benedict was a nice slice, and although not piping hot, was palatable and I did not ask to have it reheated. Irene’s pancakes were also just on the border of warm/hot, but she said they were delicious.\nThe view out the window was delightful and even though it was too cold to eat outside, we felt a coziness inside the restaurant. Debra asked us",

On Yelp it gets no love and honestly I don’t understand why. Yeah it’s outdated and in many cases I think that’s a good thing. The place reminds me a lot of the restaurants I used to go to with my family in the Redondo Beach harbor area back in the 70’s and 80’s. Actually it sounds good right now. I may have to stop there on the way home from work for a cold beer and a couple fish tacos.\nAlso you should review Fiddler’s Green just up from there in the near future.",

        "prompt": "For patients experiencing ischemic stroke - the leading cause of disability in the U.S. - time to treatment is critically important for avoiding irreversible brain damage. A study by researchers at Overlook Medical Center and Atlantic Health System published by the journal Stroke shows that patients evaluated in ambulances while in-transit to the hospital, could be treated with the brain saving drug alteplase 13 minutes faster once in the Emergency Department (referred to as door-to-needle, or DTN, time) than patients not evaluated with in-transit telestroke (ITTS).\nThe first-of-its-kind study assessed 89 presumptive stroke patients in ambulances over 15 months (Jan. 2015-Mar. 2016). Atlantic Health System paramedics responding to neurological emergencies used an InTouch Xpress device - a portable unit with a high-definition camera, microphone and screen - allowing video communication with a stroke neurologist who performed a neurological evaluation of the patient while in-transit to the emergency department (ED). Once the patients arrived at the participating hospital's ED, the neurologist assumed care and, when indicated, administered alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) that breaks down blood clots to restore blood flow to the brain.\n\"We are constantly looking for ways to treat stroke patients as quickly as possible, as each passing minute of lost blood supply translates to more brain damage,\" explained John J. Halperin, M.D., lead study investigator and chair, department of neurosciences at Overlook Medical Center. \"Our observations suggest that in-transit telestroke may provide a scalable, inexpensive way to expedite stroke treatment. We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will encourage more hospitals and ambulance corps to adopt telemedicine for stroke.\"\nNew Jersey's EMS is organized in a two-tiered system, comprised of over 500 Basic Life Support (BLS) units and 22 advanced life support (ALS) units. When ALS paramedics are engaged by 911 dispatchers, they join BLS first responders at the scene and then accompany the patient to the ED. Atlantic Health System has two ALS units serving OMC and covering a population of 300,000, and two ALS units serving CMC and covering a population of 160,000.\nEach of these four ALS units was provided an InTouch Xpress device, which is clamped onto BLS ambulance stretchers, allowing images to be transmitted by 4G wireless during patient transport. Atlantic Health System paramedics determined patient eligibility, then collaborated with the stroke teleneurologist in performing the neurological evaluation. In the ED, the stroke team, typically with the same stroke neurologist performing in-ambulance assessment, assumed care.\nFrom January 2015 through March 2016, all patients managed by these four ALS units, with an abnormal Cincinnati Stroke Scale or otherwise suspected stroke, brought to these two EDs, were assessed with in-transit telestroke (ITTS). We compared DTN and last-known-well to needle (LKWTN) times in this group with all other intravenous alteplase - treated stroke patients brought to these two EDs by EMS. Twenty-five treated walk-in stroke patients were excluded. Analysis was intention to treat; patients with failed ITTS were included in the telestroke group. Prespecified primary outcome measures were the differences in DTN and LKWTN times between these two groups.\nEighty-nine patients with suspected strokes were evaluated by ITTS. There were no misses; all alteplase-treated strokes brought to the Over",

Numbers registered in May 2015, at 247,705, represented a fall of 47% from the last household canvass, when 470,398 young people were registered. The position may improve but won’t be clear until spring 2016.\nThe government intends that the registers published in December 2015 will be used as the basis for calculating the size of constituencies as part of the next UK parliamentary boundary review. London boroughs – including Brent, Hackney, Haringey, Lambeth, and Redbridge, with their high count of Labour voters – are among authorities that have 10% or over of their total registers unconfirmed.

It can divert election officials’ time away from other activities, affect morale and cause staff to leave. This is borne out by a recent report by electoral administrators, which the minister cites in support of his argument.\nDespite the introduction of online electoral registration last year, which was a huge step forward, the numbers on the electoral roll are at crisis levels, with a dramatic decline in the post-war era. Millions are not on the roll.\nThere is a need for an urgent electoral modernisation programme to address this. Again, academic studies are instructive.

        "prompt": "The boast is vanishing from official branding. Where did it go, and why?\nBob Mackin is a veteran reporter who covered the Beijing and Vancouver Olympics, and is a regular contributor to The Tyee.\nPssst, did you notice? British Columbia is not \"The Best Place on Earth\" anymore.\nSince Premier Christy Clark's March swearing-in, the bold advertising slogan of the Gordon Campbell era has slowly and quietly disappeared from government websites and letterhead. You can still find it if you look, but blink and it could be gone.\nHow could a province with a misery-filled neighbourhood like the Downtown Eastside and a nation-leading child poverty rate ever call itself best-on-Earth in the first place? How did the politicians and bureaucrats decide to deep-six the slogan?\nThe decision, I am told, was not even of the \"back-of-the-napkin\" variety, because no scrap of paper was used to record it.\nMy July 28 Freedom of Information request for \"records including, but not limited to, briefing notes, opinion polls and market research studies, regarding the continued use, modification or elimination of the Province of British Columbia's 'Best Place on Earth' slogan and sunshine-and-mountains logo\" was answered by the Government Communications and Public Engagement office. First I was told that the Office of the Premier and ministries of finance, jobs, tourism and innovation, labour and citizens' services and open government had no records. Then I was told no records existed.\nHow could a large, sophisticated organization re-brand or de-brand without a cost-benefit analysis, polling or consultation with marketing experts? I made a supplementary FOI request to find out how the first one was processed and handled.\n\"I sent out the no records letter to the applicant and he has complained, asking for an explanation as to why there are no records,\" wrote information and privacy analyst Janice Alexander to Citizens' Services executive director of operations and human resources Denise Champion on Aug. 23. \"We will call him and advise his next step is to complain to the (Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner) so I wanted to give you a heads-up on that, and ask is there any messaging/context that GCPE would like us to relay when we speak to him?\"\nChampion responded to Alexander: \"Please explain to the applicant that, after some discussion, a decision was made to remove the slogan, however, there was no written directive issued. The decision is being implemented as opportunities occur in order to keep the cost of the change to a minimum. The sunshine and mountains logo is still in use. We cannot produce records that don't exist.\"\nThe \"Best Place on Earth\" and the sunshine-and-mountains logo (is it setting or rising?), was launched in 2005 and registered with Industry Canada's Canadian Intellectual Property Office the following year. It appeared on ICBC's Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics licence plates in 2007, replacing the traditional \"Beautiful\" above a photograph of Mount Garibaldi and the VANOC inukshuk logo.\nBut something funny happened on the way to the biggest show on Earth. When Campbell put on his salesman-in-chief hat and attended the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he called British Columbia \"Canada's Pacific Gateway\" instead of the \"Best Place on Earth.\" With a pinch of sarcasm, I asked him, why? If B.C. is really the best place anywhere, why not tell the world?\nFirst the world has to find B.C. on the map, he said.\nJobs, Tourism and Innovation minister Pat Bell offered few hints about the slogan's fate when he was grilled by NDP critic Spencer Chandra Herbert in a May 5 budget estimates debate.\nBefore obsolete, slogan was meant 'to help motivate British Columbians' explained Minister Pat Bell.\n\"Yes, I am proud of the province and I think it's the best place on earth, but it was probably not the best way to attract people from other parts of the world who think their little section of the world was the best place on earth,\" Chandra Herbert said to Bell. \"I'm just wondering: is 'best place on earth' shelved for now, and we're now not going to see that anymore, and we'll see 'Super, natural B.C.' in its place?\nBell answered that \"Best Place on Earth\" was a \"broader brand” used only in B.C. \"to help motivate British Columbians.\"\nClark, who made \"Families First\" her leadership campaign mantra, has evidently found a new slogan to call her own: \"Canada Starts Here.\"\nThe slogan was revealed Sept. 20 in Prince Rupert to kick-off the B.C. Jobs Plan tour. Otherwise known as the campaign to replace the fall election campaign that her party was scared of losing.\nThe blue, white and green logo -- the same colour scheme as Clark's favourite hockey team -- appears to be a three-storey stack of shipping containers, with the \"Canada Starts Here\" slogan in bold, white capital letters on a blue background.\nResidents of Charlottetown, P.E.I., where Fathers of Confederation historically met in 1864, would argue Canada started there.\nResidents of Cape Spear, Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost point, are already \"to-it-and-at-it,\" starting their day while teetotalers in Victoria are only halfway through dreaming of their next orange pekoe.\nAnd then there's the logjam at CIPO, which counts 52 entries for slogans containing \"...starts here,\" like: \"The Party Starts Here\" (Global Beverage Marketing Corporation), \"The Internet Starts Here\" (PSINet), \"Happy Starts Here\" (Reckitt Benckiser LLC), \"A Cleaner, Odor Free Home Starts Here\" (Church and Dwight) and \"The Buck Starts Here\" (Carlyle Cattle).\nThe Gastown Business Improvement Society had \"Vancouver Starts Here,\" but abandoned the trademark in 2009.\nThe federal finance ministry's Canada Savings Bonds program shares \"It All Starts Here\" with cereal-maker General Mills. Microsoft has the simplest of all: \"Starts Here.\"\nThere are another 35 entries in the CIPO database for \"...lives here\" slogans, including TSN (\"Hockey Lives Here\"), City of Surrey (\"The Future Lives Here\"), Vancouver Board of Trade (\"Vancouver Spirit Lives Here\") and CBC (\"Canada Lives Here\").\nOddly, the \"You Gotta Be Here\" slogan from the Tourism B.C. Olympic ad campaign is not in the registry.\nLast",

The logo contains a circular, stylized portion of the B.C. flag, but it's without the Union Jack that figured so prominently in the government's 1980s and 1990s \"spirit flag\" logo.\nIt may be a subtle admission that the party name is a liability, especially when small-c conservative members of the free enterprise coalition have a new alternative in the John Cummins-led BC Conservative Party. Clarkites fear Cummins and Co. will split the vote in the 2013 election and enable an NDP victory, thus inspiring cheeky headline writers to say \"BC Liberals stop here.\"",

Data is the new oil, we’re told, valuable not just for business insight, but for actually driving new revenue growth in its own right.\nBut you know what Biggie said: Mo’ money, mo’ problems.\nThe more businesses try to monetize data, the more problems they will encounter, experts are warning.\nAnne Buff, an evangelist in the SAS Best Practices organization, argues that data is an ethical land mine for companies integrating social data and other Big Data with internal master data in the hopes that it will illuminate customers in new ways.\nWhile data is ethically neutral, the use of data is not, she writes. That’s particularly worrying since we have few regulations or rules about how to use this new breed of external data.\nTraditionally, external data sets such as customer lists and financial data are acquired under contracts, from specific service providers, and with strict usage guidelines.\nThat’s not the case with many Big Data sets, particularly the kind companies collect and integrate on their own. That doesn’t mean you can use that data any way you want without repercussions",

Eighty-eight percent said consumers should be worried about data privacy.\nA clear majority, 80 percent, said there should be an ethical framework in place for collecting and using data. The results actually varied by industry, with 92 percent in the life scientists/health care industry agreeing that an ethical framework is needed compared to 76 percent in the education industry.\nFortunately, more than half of data scientists and statisticians say they’re already using an ethical framework as part of their work with data.\nSpecify your core organizational values, and be transparent about them in all communications.\nAssess and keep on top of the values of your customers.\nRegularly audit your data handling processes to ensure your actions and values align.\nCommunicate these values internally, and externally to your customers.",

        "prompt": "Did later Christians change what the earliest followers of Jesus believed about him?\nWhy do an overwhelming number of Christians believe (or say they believe) things about Jesus that were not believed by his earliest followers in Jerusalem, led by his brother James?\nThis important question results from the previous Q and A item, which summarized central teaching about Jesus Christ that has united most Christians since it was finalized by 5th Century ecumenical councils. It holds that the one true God exists in a Trinity of three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that Jesus the Son has two natures, fully human yet fully divine. Myriad worshipers over centuries have professed each week that Jesus Christ is of one “being” or “substance” with God the Father.\nHowever, in modern times the traditional teaching has been challenged in differing ways by secular thinkers, Protestant liberals, Unitarians, Latter-day Saints (“Mormons”), Jehovah’s Witnesses, certain Pentecostalists and, of course, by religions totally outside the Christian orbit like Judaism and Islam.\nThe Religion Guy confesses he has not read the hefty books that discuss this and relies upon secondary materials from the experts. This answer bypasses numerous technicalities; if interested, you can research why early church councils rejected the teaching of the Apollinarians, Arians, Docetists, Ebionites, Eutychians, Gnostics, Sabellians and the rest. Note that the question raises only the divinity of Jesus the Son, not of the Holy Spirit, and only what the earliest Christians believed, not how Jesus thought of himself.\nAbout James. He was one of Jesus’ four \"brothers\" (Mark 6:3) and a skeptic turned believer who, yes, led the original church in Jerusalem. The Sanhedrin accused James of violating Jewish law and he was executed in A.D. 62. He’s traditionally seen as the writer of the New Testament’s letter of James, though other options have been proposed.\nWith that ground cleared, on to Norman’s theme. Obviously the councils used terms like “Trinity” not found as such in the New Testament as they sought to put into words a concept beyond comprehension -- Jesus as both human and divine. So, did the councils change original Christianity? Or were they faithful to what 1st Century Christians believed and only defined the full implications?\nNorman echoes the liberal outlook proclaimed especially by Germany’s Wilhelm Bousset (1865-1920) in his influential 1913 tome “Kyrios Christos,” a high point of his \"religionsgeschichtliche schule\" (history of religions school). In essence, Bousset contended that Palestinian Jews would have believed so strictly in the one God that they couldn’t have viewed the human Jesus as divine. Therefore, such belief must have infiltrated from pagan Greek culture. Click here (.pdf) for agood academic rundown on that.\nMore recently, a group of scholars led by Larry W. Hurtado of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, is challenging Bousset. Hurtado’s quarter-century of research culminated in his tour de force “Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity” (2003). He boils down major points for non-academic readers in “How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?: Historical Questions about Earliest Devotion to Jesus” (2005) and in this 2010 paper (.pdf here).\nB",
        "baseline": "ousset admitted the evident fact that Jesus became the object of intense devotion remarkably early and rapidly. Hurtado considers it possible this occurred among devout Jews even before the apostle Paul’s dramatic conversion in A.D. 36 some three years after Jesus was crucified (dates per Jack Finegan, Pacific School of Religion).

The ... outlook for forecasters inside and outside the Fed is for more of the same.\nOn Wednesday, payroll firm ADP announced that 230,000 non-farm jobs were added in September, followed almost immediately by the Institute for Supply Management’s report that its non-manufacturing index jumped to the highest level seen since that index as created.\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor reported that 134,000 jobs were created in September along with huge upward adjustments of its numbers in July and August. Put all together, for the year through September the U.S. economy has added 1.8 million new jobs.\nThis good news was just too good, and by the close of business on Friday the yield on the U.S. Government’s 10-year note had hit four-year highs while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had sold off 500 points.\nBond investors, who have been nervously watching interest rates on the U.S. Government’s Treasury securities move to their highest levels since April, 2011, began to sell off large portions of their holdings. Their panic was palpable: The 10-year U.S. Government bond is a proxy for mortgages supporting the housing market and rising interest rates will slow that market even further. The New American reported on Thursday that the home price index tracked by the Economic Cycle Research Institute “has made a downturn that it hasn’t made in a long time,” and both stock and bond investors could see the threat that higher interest rates would pose on that struggling market.\nOn Friday, additional evidence of the U.S.’s remarkable economy came from the National Association of Manufacturers. It reported that nearly 93 percent of its 14,000 members are projecting further expansion of their businesses, one of the highest and most positive outlooks seen in the last 20 years.\nThe stock and bond markets continued their selloffs into the close on Friday.\nThere are clouds appearing on the economic horizon as The New American noted on Thursday, including the car dealers’ “doldrums indicator,” consumer debt approaching an unfathomable $4 trillion, crude oil prices hitting a four-year high, stock price valuations “now in the 97th percentile” of historic averages, and an unsustainable national debt that is estimated to exceed $40 trillion in less than a dozen years.\nBut he is best known for saying, “The Federal Reserve ... is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up",

The Fed chair apparently thinks he can remove the punch bowl without anyone noticing. But party-goers see what is happening and last week started leaving the party early.\nThe bond markets are closed on Monday for Columbus Day. Market observers wondering whether the mini-panic that drove interest rates to four-year highs last week and the Dow to a 500-point loss will subside over the long weekend will have to wait until Tuesday to find out.",

        "prompt": "Above: Ian Dallas, head of Giant Sparrow, showing off What Remains of Edith Finch at PSX.\nIan Dallas has a knack for coming up with weird but creative stories for video games. His first game, The Unfinished Swan, was one of my favorites of 2012. Now, his Giant Sparrow studio is working on an equally bizarre game called What Remains of Edith Finch.\nIt is a haunting tale about a cursed family in the state of Washington, and how each member of the family dies. It takes place across generations, but each tale involves something to do with the Finch home. Dallas told me about the game’s ongoing development at the PlayStation Experience event in San Francisco last weekend. With The Unfinished Swan, his team didn’t figure out the ending until late in the process. This time, he isn’t even trying to create the ending until he is further along with the stories of each family member.\nWhile some bigger games have to be written in stone before production begins, Giant Sparrow’s team is smaller and it is able to be more flexible in its creativity. Dallas freely admits that he doesn’t know the destination, even though he is pretty far down the road in building the game. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.\nIan Dallas: It’s a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington state. Each story is about a different family member and how they die.\nGamesBeat: And you got the idea how, again?\nDallas: It came from weird fiction, is the primary source. People like H. P. Lovecraft, Lord Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood. Mostly short stories about surreal, supernatural events. Also a healthy amount of the Twilight Zone and guys like Luis Bunuel — Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, movies like that.\nActually, the original inspiration was what it feels like to be underwater. I started scuba diving in the Pacific northwest. The feeling I had seeing the ocean slope away, not being able to see where it goes, feeling like you’re so far out of your depth, this tiny little insignificant speck. Trying to make a game that was about the sublime, but in a slightly terrifying position. In a very large nutshell, that’s it.\nGamesBeat: What genre would you put it in?\nDallas: Sublime horror? If I could make a genre, that’d be the one. Something that hopefully speaks to the bizarre and cold beauty of the universe. Lovecraft talks about that a lot, but it’s really hard to do that with Lovecraft now, because everything is so much about tentacles. It’s become very set. So it’s trying to make something that still feels like it has a lot of unknowns in it.\nA lot of the value in what we do comes from how it’s something out on the periphery. It’s unusual. That’s an important value, an important part of what we’re doing, so everything is optimized around trying to keep the process pretty flexible. There’s a window. Like in Indiana Jones, the door that’s coming down?\nIt’s a funny situation, where the farther you get into development, the more you know about the game, and the better your tools are for enacting your changes. But you have less time to make changes and those changes can be more costly. It’s almost like Cassandra. In Unfinished Swan, we knew the game was a bit too long for players. We had a fix. We’d just take part of the city, get rid of it, and then smoosh these two areas together. But there wasn’t time to enact it.\nGamesBeat: I went to Pixar once and saw how it made movies. In contrast to video games, their filmmakers script everything out frame-by-frame. By the time they give it to the artists to start the rendering work, they can’t make any changes. They did make a few changes in Monsters University, where they changed the villain from a male to a female, and it apparently cost them an ungodly amount of money. Yet they’re known as so creative. It’s an interesting contrast.\nFor us one of the things we’ve tried to do as we’ve grown the team — we’re up to 16 people now – there’s a lot of work that has to be scheduled every week. We try to have parts of the game that are more well-understood, especially the art investment — that’s a part you can never get back. If someone models a record player and you’re like, “No, we’ll set the story 50 years earlier, before that was invented,” there’s no used for that model anymore. It’s just lost work. With programming there’s a bit more re-use.\nHaving the house has been a nice safe haven to soak up work. When there are times where design doesn’t really know what to do, or we’re making something that we think might change, we can throw artists at making bedrooms. We can split the tasks up and move people around.\nAbove: The Finch house in What Remains of Edith Finch.\nGamesBeat: This is a very modular design, it seems. You have one character, another character, and another character. Can you do the stories in a serial way?\nDallas: That was one of the reasons we initially set it up as a series of short stories, stories about a family. The feeling was that we could toss things off the back of the bus, if needed, to lighten the load. That’s still kind of true. But we’re now at a point where we have such a large family, with all these interconnections, that removing one piece — it’s not impossible. We’ve cut story recently. But it requires some deft changes to suture the wound.\nIn the end there are places where we’ve cut things and the game is better for it. Things fit in ways that weren’t obvious in the beginning. It’s a weird paradox. As you go farther into development you’re able to make these sweeping cuts and changes that make the game better, because you know so much more about the game is. It’s like being a surgeon. You know the cuts you can make that will help the patient. Earlier on you’re just fumbling around and you’re as likely to kill the patient as save them.\nGamesBeat: On a lot of games, people start preproduction and do a lot of early prototyping. They seem to cut that off around six months in and then they know what they’re going to do. That doesn’t seem to work for you.\nDallas: Yeah. There are days where I wish we’d just added a couple of years where we were still three or four people. But it works okay for us. What’s interesting about the games we make is that they do have a large team associated with them, so we can make things that have a sense of grandeur to them. You wouldn’t be able to do that with just a couple of people.\nThe balance we’ve found for this game is to have stories that are in rolling development. One story will be a super early prototype. The artists and tech artists will be involved for a few days making some prototype stuff, because it helps us understand the story to have a few things arted out. But then the rest of the team is on stories that are more well-defined. Of course, the problem is that if design lags a bit, you get this logjam of people waiting for work that’s not set yet. That’s where we try to do more stuff in-house and balance it there. But the stories are little prototypes in various phases, going right up to the end.\nThat’s partly intentional, based on the experience of Unfinished Swan. We didn’",
        "baseline": "t really have an ending for that game until a few months before we were meant to be done with it. I think the game was better for that. Like I keep saying, the farther you are in development, the more you know what it feels like to play the game, to have the experience of seeing all of these sequence—you know where people are mentally and what they’re concerned about. In Swan we were able to create an ending that played into where people were. We were working with the grain.\nIn the beginning, for me—I think I know where I’m going to go, but I’m so wrong. For this game we didn’t even really try. We had some ideas for where the ending would go, but that’s something we’ve deliberately postponed so we can make something that feels like it nicely wraps up, or doesn’t, all the various threads we’ve created earlier on.",

        "prompt": "Usain Bolt, the global track star from Jamaica, ran his last 100m dash on Saturday at the 2017 world championships, concluding a record-breaking career that spanned three Olympic Games. Christopher Clarey of The New York Times joins Hari Sreenivasan to recap Bolt’s achievements and discuss what his retirement -- if it sticks -- would mean for the sport.\nThe last 100-meter race of his career did not go as planned for Usain Bolt. He came in third place at the world championships in London, losing to two Americans, Justin Gatlin who took the gold and Chris Coleman who took the silver. Bolt, still the world record holder, said this would be his last competition.\nFor more context about the Bolt effect, earlier I spoke with Christopher Clarey of \"The New York Times\" who joined me via Skype from London.\nChris, is it possible to overestimate the as a matter of impact of Usain Bolt on track and field and sports?\nYou know, he has been the face and the soul of the sport for almost a decade now, and it's extraordinary. It really is. He has been the one global figure that they've had, and also he's been pretty good news for the sport, instead of a lot of bad news. So, definitely, a seminal figure.\nIt's a bit like Michael Phelps is to swimming, or Tiger Woods as to golf. When you think of track and field, you have that, you know, million watts smile and the guy doing the lightning bolt dance at the end of his races.\nNo, it's true. He and Phelps are a good comparison. I mean, they've just been the kings of their sports in the same period of time. They kind of broke through in Beijing and dominated that Olympics at the same time. Very similar. Dominant figures, huge appetite for success, and really enduring.\nYou know, even if track and field — as track and field had these sort of repeated, high-profile doping incidents, Usain Bolt was able to just kind of glide above it all, winning match — or meet after meet.\nIn a way, that's been maybe his greatest accomplishment in some way, greatest act he's pulled up in a sense that he's been able to really remain above that fray. It's been quite a fray. A lot of scandals in track and field, a lot of credibility crises, and Bolt really has been able to stay above that.\nThere have been things that have affected him. He's lost a medal in the relay because one of his teammates was involved in a doping infraction. There have been, you know, fellow Jamaicans who tested positive for banned substances as well, including Asafa Powell. But Usain has never tested positive, never been sanctioned. So, that's a bit of good news for the sport.\nIs there a reason he chose to retire now? I mean, you can see that his times have been slowing, and — but this is a guy who loves the competition, who loves to get in there and win. I mean, I don't think, at least in the interviews that I've read, I don't think he particularly likes to train and put the work in, but he does it because he loves to win.\nI think that's it. I think that's — you put your finger on it. I mean, he's had injury problems throughout his career. He's got to come in to major championships for the last five years fighting injuries almost every time. So, I think he's tired of that.\nAnd, really, I mean, he did a great documentary last year which was a lot of fun to watch called \"I Am Bolt,\" and you can see him complaining about the training in almost every scene. I mean, I think he really enjoys the competition, enjoys that magnetic moment when he's out there and the crowd is communing with him and racing and beating everybody.\nBut when it comes to the day-to-day drudgery of being a sprinter, I think he would be happy to leave that behind, and I think, also, he's really done all there is to do in this sport.\nAnd this is a guy, when you look at him, he doesn't look like a sprinter that has been the archetype that we've had, especially in the 100 meters. This short, super, stocky, muscular guys that explode out of the blocks. He's literally, at times a foot taller than his competition.\nYes, it's true. When he lines up to race and get in a set position, you can see he's already higher than everybody else even with his head down. He's a much taller person, about 6'5″.\nYou look back in the past of track and field, Carl Lewis obviously wasn't as tall as Usain, but he was the same sort of — same sort of lines. You know, a tall — a tall sprinter by those standards of that day. And I think now what Bolt has really done is being able to combine the two of being a tall sprinter but he also has a very quick turnover, able to explode off the track and really produce tremendous power in each of his strides. And also, he has long strides so he's able to cover the whole race, 100 meters in about 41 strides whereas a lot of his competitors are 44, 45, 46. So, that's all been a big factor and many will try to replicate it in the years to come.\nDo you ever wonder what that world record time could have been in Beijing or other places where it almost seemed like in the last 10 meters, he's looking up at the big screen, and he's almost coast",
        "baseline": "ing in? I mean, there wasn't anybody just kind of breathing down his neck, and if he'd just given us that last extra 10 percent.\nYes, you're right. I mean, that was the first breakthrough globally at the Beijing Olympics when he did let up in the 100 when he got to the finish line.\nBut a year later in Berlin, when he set the world record that still exist, 9.58 seconds, he ran through the tape, and you saw what happened, a world record. But he's been unable to touch, maybe nobody will touch for many, many years to come. And he himself was quite young at the time, we figured he'd be able to go on, maybe get into the 9.4s, never did for a variety of reasons, but he did run through the tape and that record is there to prove it.\nAll right. Christopher Clarey of \"The New York Times,\" thanks so much for joining us.",

        "prompt": "In the course of the 20th century, a resident of the city now known as Lviv would have lived in five different countries without ever leaving home. Before World War I, the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was known by the German name Lemberg. After Austria’s defeat in 1918, it was part of the territory awarded to the newly created state of Poland and began to go by its Polish name, Lvov. During WWII, Lvov was occupied by the Nazis, who incorporated it into the province they called the General Government. After three years—during which the city’s Jewish population of some 150,000 was annihilated—Lvov was liberated by the Red Army but it was not returned to Poland. Rather, it was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and almost the entire Polish population was transferred hundreds of miles to the west, to areas that Poland had annexed from Germany. Finally, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the city became part of an independent Ukraine, under the name of Lviv.\na peach. It is everywhere.\nZagajewski, now in his 70s, is widely considered the leading Polish poet of his generation—the generation after the one that included titans like Czeslaw Milosz and Wislawa Szymborska. He has always written prose as well as verse, and his new book, Slight Exaggeration, is a hybrid of diary, criticism, and aphorism—a depository for the poet’s observations and ruminations over a period of several years. While “To Go to Lvov” is now decades old—and the emigration from Lvov itself took place more than 70 years ago, before his own birth—in this book (translated from the Polish by Clare Cavanagh) Zagajewski’s thoughts return again and again to the place and its inhabitants.\nPolish emigres from Lvov, the people he was raised among, were dedicated to the past: “guardians of memory” who “lived on, ever older, in poorer health, more hunched, more forgetful … with ever greater suffering,” yet determined to “discreetly control the state of knowledge about the City for as long as possible.” The poet was infected at birth, as it were, with this dreamy longing for a place he never actually knew. Yet he points out that “To Go to Lvov,” for all its popularity among the emigres, also aroused their suspicion. After all, “didn’t the very fact of speaking about the lost City, speaking in verse, with poetic enthusiasm, place the author beyond the pale of the dispossessed?” Perhaps it was only because Zagajewski was not from Lvov that he could praise it so vividly; the actual “dispossessed” were too defensive of their memories, too gloomy in their nostalgia, to turn Lvov into art.\nThere is an element of fastidiousness in this aesthetic faith, a shrinking from what Zagajewski sometimes perceives as the banality and vulgarity of ordinary people’s pursuits. (Rock music comes in for some disdain in the book, as do cell phones.) But at the same time, Zagajewski is aware that his own enthusiasm is vulnerable to irony and skepticism. “I don’t know how my fellow poets live, but I know perfectly well that I don’t usually believe in my own poems,” he writes, suggesting that the kind of aesthetic rapture that provokes poetry is short-lived, and hard to recapture after the fact.\nThat is one reason why",
        "baseline": " he admires genuine mystics, in whose number he includes figures as different as D.H. Lawrence and Simone Weil. Another of Zagajewski’s well-known poems is titled “Mysticism for Beginners,” in which the title of a pop spirituality book, glimpsed at a café, becomes a motto for a way of life: the world in all its beauty exists in order to provoke us into a sense of its miraculousness, its strangeness. Poetry is the genre Zagajewski uses to capture those moments of insight. His prose, more relaxed, urbane, and various, chronicles moments of less intensity, but still opulent, dedicated to travel and music, thought and art. It is an existence luxurious in some ways, rigorous and exigent in others—as we would all like our lives to be.\nApril is National Poetry Month.

Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova as defense minister is viewed with a mixed reaction in Washington.\nCritics of Duarte's decision worry that Vides Casanova's presence will weaken the new President's ability to purge the Army of officers involved with death squads.\nThe group that expresses this concern is composed of moderates and liberals - some United States congressmen, their staff people, and others - who met regularly this spring with Salvadorean military chief of staff Col. Adolfo Onecifero Blandon and other military officers to get the military to clean house. This group is convinced that Vides Casanova was one of the most important members of the military leadership that approved of the organization and activities of death squads.\nThe ranks of the critics grew last month when the Reagan administration declassified a report on an investigation into the 1981 killings of four US churchwomen in El Salvador. Liberal Democratic Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio was one of those who strongly criticized the Vides Casanova reappointment after reading the report, which stated that it is very possible Vides Casanova covered up the murder of the churchwomen.\nOthers congressmen - mostly political conservatives - support Duarte's decision to keep Vides Casanova.\n''We have to give Duarte some room to work with,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde (R) of Illinois, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''If Duarte has reappointed Vides Casanova, it is because he knows better than most what it would take to get the support of the military, and I'm not prepared to condemn that.\n''He needs to take the necessary steps to co-opt the military. From my vantage point, I think that Duarte has good chances to clean up the military. I think intelligent people in the Salvadoran military understand that they have to make the Duarte government work,'' Representative Hyde said in an interview.\nA Republican Senate staffer stresses privately that Vides Casanova, unlike Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, his predecessor as defense minister, is regarded as a man of principle in his personal life, not corrupt like many of his fellow officers, and a family man. He called the defense minister ''one of the few beacons of stability they (the Salvadorean military) have left,'' noting that the Army has already undergone considerable change in the last few years.\nAnother who has criticized the Vides Casanova reappointment is moderate Salvadorean exile Leonel Gomez, who is a member of the Washington group of critics concerned about Salvadorean death squads.\nGomez, who regularly criticizes both Salvador's guerrillas and its government , says Defense Minister Vides Casanova ''was more responsible than many others'' in the Salvadorean military for death squad activity.\nIf Vides Casanova is left in power, Gomez says, the psychological message sent to the Salvadorean armed forces power structure will be ''",

They said it had the effect of telling the Salvadorean military high command that the Reagan administration is unaware of ''basic Salvadorean realities,'' and is willing to ignore the degree to which the Salvadorean Army was involved in the killings.

        "prompt": "The live-capture stage-to-screen season at the Amherst Cinema has begun, with a lineup of adaptations of world classics from the London stage – a dance-happy movie musical, a steamy exploration of transgressive desire, a surreal whodunnit, a Gothic horror story – plus a modern-dress Shakespeare. Most come courtesy of the ongoing National Theatre Live series. Here they are, in upcoming order.\nSept. 29, 12:30pm — The Broadway and West End hit musical An American in Paris was “inspired by” the 1951 MGM movie, which itself was inspired by George Gershwin’s jazzy 1928 orchestral piece. The musical premiered, appropriately enough, in Paris, in 2014, then moved to New York and thence to London, where this enchanting production was recorded.\nCraig Lucas’s adaptation, staged by Christopher Wheeldon and starring the two original leads, Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, adds some plot and extra characters while showcasing a dozen classic Gershwin tunes, including the iconic title number – not danced all over Paris as Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron did in the movie, but reinvented as a balletic dream sequence. And the dancing hardly ever stops. If someone breaks into song it’s sure to blossom into a production number (“Stairway to Paradise” begins in a small jazz club and morphs into Radio City Music Hall, complete with Rockettes).\nThe action moves cinematically through numerous locations, from the streets of Paris (there’s a fabulous dance prelude celebrating the war’s end, set to Gershwin’s Concerto in F) to bars and nightclubs, galleries and Seine-side parapets, accomplished with rolling set pieces and ingenious projections.\nThe venue is shifted from rural Sweden to a deluxe London townhouse where a wild party is going on above the basement kitchen. Julie, giddy with drink and self-pity, plays at friendship with her maid, Kristina, and performs a dangerous pas de deux with her father’s chauffeur, Jean, who has brains and ambitions above his station.\nAs Julie, Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in The Crown) is every bit as willful, impulsive, needy and self-absorbed as Strindberg’s anti-heroine – to which she adds a few lines of cocaine. Kristina and Jean are both black, adding race to the play’s roiling cauldron of class and gender roles. Thalissa Teixeira and Eric Kofi Abrefa are both captivating, she proud beneath the weight of subservience, he wary but longing as he circles into Julie’s tantalizing orbit.\nOctober 8 — The Curious Incident of the Dog",

        "prompt": "On November 2, 1917, the British government expressed its sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations and announced that it would use its “best endeavors” to facilitate “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” The announcement came in a letter from Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, the unofficial leader of the British Jewish community. The Balfour declaration became the diplomatic foundation stone of the state of Israel; it is considered the original sin by Israel’s opponents.\nIn this comprehensive study, richly documented by diplomatic correspondence, Jonathan Schneer concludes that the famous declaration seems to have just missed the sidetrack of history: in contrast to a common myth, Britain’s support for Zionism was not the result of an inevitable process. In fact, as Schneer reveals, shortly after Balfour’s promise to the Jews, the British government offered the Ottoman Empire the opportunity to keep Palestine and to continue to fly the Turkish flag over it.\nChaim Weizmann, the leading spokesman for Zionism in Britain, must have felt ill at ease when he entered those awesome corridors of power. A Russian-born chemist, he began to solicit support among the British soon after he settled in Manchester in 1904. He could hardly speak English in those days: his first contacts with British officials were conducted in French. But if he was taken aback by the snobbery and coolness that awaited him at Whitehall, he made sure to conceal his uneasiness, acting as if he commanded an almost omnipotent power: world Jewry. The British believed he did.\nObviously there was no “Jewish power” controlling world affairs, but Weizmann successfully pretended that the Jews were in fact turning the wheels of history. For once, the anti-Semitic image of the Jews proved useful — they were believed to be so maliciously dangerous that one would do best to acquire them as allies rather than as enemies.\nBut fear of the Jews was only one part of the story. The other part, which Schneer neglects to explore, was the genuine admiration many of Britain’s leaders, including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Balfour himself, felt for the Jews and their history. These men were deeply religious Christian Zionists. They had grown up on the Bible; the Holy Land was their spiritual home. Modern Zionism, they believed, would fulfill a divine promise and resettle the Jews in the land of their ancient fathers.\nAs part of this context, Schneer expertly analyzes the passionate and fascinating controversy between non-Zionist and Zionist Jews that preceded the Balfour declaration. The Zionists spoke in the name of Jewish nationhood; their Jewish opponents denied that Jews even constituted a separate nation.\nAccording to Schneer, the Arabs were as invisible to the early Zionists as Africans had been to Boers in South Africa, or Indians to the French and English colonists in North America. But in fact, some of the first Zionists were well aware of the Arabs’ vehement objection to their national aspirations. As early as 1899, Theodore Herzl himself, the father of political Zionism, corresponded with the Arab mayor of Jerusalem, Yusuf Dia al-Khalidi, who urged him to find a national home for the Jews somewhere else in the world. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have had its origins at the very beginning of Zionism.\nMany of the British diplomatic papers Schneer examines were brilliantly written. At times it seems that these dispatches and reports, rather than analyses of foreign policy, were the exercises of frustrated poets and writers, educated at Eton and Oxford, who hoped for posterity in the Public Record Office. Much of what they wrote led nowhere, though Schneer elaborates on their maneuvers at great length.\nHe details, for instance, the correspondence between British officials and the Arabs, as well as a secret diplomatic scheme of 1916 known as the “Sykes-­Picot Agreement,” which would have partitioned much of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine, between Britain and France. These initiatives have little significance today, except perhaps with regard to the Arab contention that the British had promised Palestine to the Arabs before they promised it to the Jews. Schneer suggests that the promises given to the Arabs were too vague and contradictory to evaluate. Still, the way he reveals the characters behind the diplomatic papers, bringing them to life, makes his book particularly enjoyable.\nTake Britain’s magnificent, if abortive, effort to detach the Ottoman Empire from the Central Powers. The idea was to orchestrate what would today be called regime change in Turkey. The new rulers would then make a separate peace with Britain, retain Palestine and get a handsome bribe for themselves — millions of American dollars. The central figure in this drama was a man named Basil Z",
        "baseline": "aharoff, later Sir Basil, an Ottoman-born arms dealer and self-made diplomat whose corruption, pomposity and eccentricity British policy makers could not resist.\nThe Balfour declaration thus finds its place among a multitude of fruitless schemes and indulgent fantasies, except, of course, that in this case, surprisingly, the British by and large kept their word. For at least two decades they allowed the Zionist movement to bring hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants into Palestine, and these new arrivals set up hundreds of settlements including several towns, as well as the political, economic, military and cultural infrastructure of the future state of Israel. But if Israel’s existence originated with the British, so did the Palestinians’ tragedy. The Balfour declaration was only the opening chapter of a still unfinished story.\nTom Segev’s new book, “Simon Wiesen­thal: The Life and Legends,” will be published next month.",

Yup, I did that!\nI hate the ads of a certain ice-cream brand that are essentially a montage of a boy and a girl coming closer over a cone filled with chocolate and cream layers.

And I also like not using love as an excuse to sell a cone of ice-cream.\nAre we lonely if we don’t have someone to share cute food with?\nBrands and businesses capitalise on love and also the absence of it. It starts small: They will make you crave the ice-cream first and eventually, romance. The ads have a message for lovers but, they also have a message for those who don’t have bonds of the romantic kind. And, it has a lot to do with making you feel bad about your singlehood. Not cool, brands!\nDo they really involve themselves with the love-story of their patrons?\nThese gifts and Valentine's Day special products are sneakily thoughtful; they come with care-packages that deceivingly look like they are tailor-made for you. You look at couples’ socks and think, “Oh, that’ll be great for boo, she always has cold feet.” (*snickers*). But, do brands care if you have unresolved issues about how messy your partner's sock drawer is? No, not really. They thrive on stereotypes and you foolishly fit in. They aren’t being inclusive, they are just making pools for audiences to sell stuff too and you’re jumping right in! How’s that for original thought?\nWhy does everything have to be so cringey?\nLet’s talk about the real problem with consumerism—whatever sells, will be oversold. I legit walked past a mall that was practically decked up for the celebrations and it looked like a big structure filled with red glitter, tacky!

That�s at least how U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia felt last week when Citgo  the U.S.-based company owned by the government of Venezuela�s left-wing President Hugo Chavez  delivered 5 million gallons of heating oil at a 40% discount to low-income Philadelphia residents. Fattah says he doesn�t understand the objections of many congressional conservatives who feel U.S. cities should not be helping improve the image of Chavez, one of President Bush�s most strident critics. \"The U.S. buys 1.5 million barrels of oil from Venezuela each day at full price,\" says Fattah, \"so why would anyone complain about getting some at almost half price?\"\nThat�s a question the Bush Administration  whose feelings for Chavez are certainly mutual  has struggled to answer ever since Venezuela initiated the Citgo program last November. While the heating oil gesture has certainly allowed Chavez to tweak Bush�s nose, it is also being recognized inside and outside of Washington as a public relations coup for Chavez�s Bolivarian Revolution (named for South America�s 19th-century independence hero, Simon Bolivar).\nAs a result, it�s growing well beyond its original scope: Philadelphia, Boston, the Bronx and cities in Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island have received a total of 45 million gallons of the subsidized Citgo fuel, and other cities are slated for another 5 million soon. That�s a small percentage of the heating oil Venezuela exports to the U.S. each year, but Citgo says it has set aside about 10% of its refined petroleum products for the program. Says Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington, D.C., \"Unfortunately for the Bush Administration, Chavez is proving to be a more inventive thinker in terms of hemispheric politics.\"\nIt�s also good business thinking, says Venezuela�s Ambassador to the U.S., Bernardo Alvarez, one of the program�s architects. When 13 U.S. Senators sent a letter to major U.S. oil companies last fall seeking heating fuel aid for lower-income residents in northern states, Citgo  a subsidiary of the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)  was the only one to step forward. \"The U.S. is our biggest [oil export] customer,\" says Alvarez. \"PDVSA is simply responding to that client the way any company should.\"\nCritics suggest Chavez�s oil diplomacy is simply a ploy to take consumers� minds off of record high oil prices, which are partly a result of his efforts to rebuild the power of OPEC, of which Venezuela is a founding member. Alvarez insists crude prices in the 1990s were \"unfairly low\" for producers like Venezuela  but says the Citgo program does give Chavez a chance to showcase \"one of our revolution�s most important principles: the redistribution of oil revenues, especially for the poor.\" He adds it also reflects \"the kind of cooperation mechanism we�re using with our neighbor countries in Latin America.\" Many of them  especially Cuba, whose communist leader Fidel Castro is one of Chavez�s closest allies  get cheaper access to Venezuelan crude as part of Chavez�s campaign to forge greater Latin American integration and less economic reliance on the U.S. Last Friday, in a move that further irritated the U.S., Chavez was awarded the United Nations' Jose Marti prize for promoting Latin American unity.\nBut the heating oil project�s biggest diplomatic coup, Alvarez concedes, may be the good will it generates among Americans at a time of deteriorating U.S.-Venezuela relations  strained ever since the Bush Administration was widely accused of backing a failed 2002 coup against Chavez (a charge it denies). Chavez, who has been democratically elected twice and is almost certain to win reelection this year, is convinced the U.S. is out to assassinate him or invade Venezuela for its oil; the White House, concerned about a growing wave of leftist victories in",

(Citgo, Chavez aides point out, is also a NASCAR sponsor.) \"We�ll continue to support a people whose government is hostile to us,\" says Alvarez. \"We have nothing against this country.\" Venezuelans and Americans might feel that way, but for the moment it seems that no amount of heating oil, no matter how deeply discounted, could thaw the enmity between their two governments.",

They just made their biggest move.\nThe Bears have acquired star pass rusher Khalil Mack from the Raiders in a massive trade that sends two first-round draft picks to Oakland.\nOakland will get first-round selections in 2019 and 2020, a sixth-rounder next year and a third-rounder in 2020. Oakland also included its second-round selection in 2020 and a conditional fifth-rounder that year.\nMack and the Bears agreed to a six-year, $141 million extension that guarantees $90 million. That makes him the highest paid defensive player in league history one day after Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the 2017 Defensive Player of the Year, signed a six-year, $135 million deal, with $87 million guaranteed.\nThe fifth overall selection in the 2014 draft, Mack is a two-time All-Pro and the 2016 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Mack has played in every game for Oakland the past four seasons, with 231 primary tackles, 40 1/2 sacks, and nine forced fumbles.\nSince entering the league, Mack leads all players with 185 1/2 quarterback pressures and ranks second with 68 tackles for loss, according to SportRadar. He is one of the most versatile defenders in the NFL.\nSimply put, he’s a game changer.\nThe move sent shock waves around the league.\nMack had been a cornerstone in Oakland along with Carr ever since being drafted and helped the Raiders end a 13-year playoff drought in 2016. But he never formed a relationship with Gruden, who had said the opportunity to coach Mack was one of the reasons he was attracted to the job.\nGruden had called Mack Oakland’s best player but decided to go in a different direction rather than give another player a contract worth more than $20 million a year after Carr got a lucrative extension last summer.\nThe Raiders invested heavily in the pass rush in the draft, taking tackles P.J. Hall and Maurice Hurst, and end Arden Key in hopes of teaming them with Mack and Irvin. The three rookies showed promise in the preseason, but they will never get the chance to play with Mack.\nOakland hosts the Rams on Sept. 10. Chicago opens on Sept. 9 in a prime-time game against Green Bay.\nA three-time Pro Bowl pick, Mack is also the best pass rusher acquired by the Bears since they signed Julius Peppers away from Carolina with a six-year deal in 2010.\nThe Bears last traded two first-round picks when they acquired quarterback Jay Cutler from Denver in 2009.

        "prompt": "On Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the federal death penalty.\nThere was little surprise in a federal jury voting death for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and little ground for sympathy in the record of the defendant himself, beyond his sheer youth. While the evidence presented at trial seemed to confirm the picture of his enraged older brother Tamerlan as the radicalized instigator of their brutal plot, Dzhokhar’s protracted role ahead of time and his stone-cold activities in the hours following the bombing (for example, calmly cruising the dairy aisle at Whole Foods) are not the material from which a strong mitigation case is made.\nBut while perhaps inevitable, Tsarnaev’s federal death sentence is still profoundly unsettling. He was sentenced to death in a state that abolished capital punishment 31 years ago; in a city whose residents had overwhelmingly preferred that he be imprisoned for life; and in a courtroom in which sat survivors and victims’ family members who were themselves deeply divided over his fate. What does it mean when a killer is sentenced to die by lethal injection against the wishes of the very community he injured? What is the purpose of a federal prosecution imposing capital punishment on a region that wants none of it, at a moment when the death penalty has been abandoned by more than one-third of all states?\nState death-penalty law, for better or worse, is usually a deep reflection of local history, culture, and debate. That’s true in the states that still routinely execute prisoners, like Texas and Oklahoma, as well as in the nine states that have abolished capital punishment since 1980, like Massachusetts.\nToday’s federal death penalty—a calculated political invention of then-president Bill Clinton—is a different story. Until 20 years ago, capital punishment on the federal level was limited to treason and a handful of other offenses not covered by state law. But in 1994, the Clinton administration—responding to the first World Trade Center bombing and hoping to burnish its tough-on-crime credentials—radically expanded capital punishment, writing 60 new death-penalty offenses, including several related to terrorism, into a sweeping criminal-justice “reform” package.\nIt didn’t do much good; seven months after the Clinton crime bill was signed, Timothy McVeigh and two co-conspirators bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. So the next year, Clinton and Congress went even further, passing the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. This package—one of the most deceptively labeled bills of all time—limited habeas corpus and weakened the protections offered to state and federal death-row prisoners, most of whom had nothing to do with terrorism.\nFar from reflecting a social consensus, these changes were designed to inoculate Clinton and his allies in the country’s most ardently pro-execution regions and to resell capital punishment to states that had rejected it. US Attorneys could push capital trials into non-death-penalty jurisdictions, occasionally leading to notable conflicts. In 2011, for instance, federal prosecutors in Rhode Island—a state without capital punishment since the 1980s—insisted on pursuing the death penalty against a gas-station robber who would otherwise have been sentenced in the state’s criminal courts. Then-governor Lincoln Chafee was so incensed at this imposition that he committed a singular act of civil disobedience: For almost two years, he refused to hand the offender over to the feds. The dispute was settled only when the robber pleaded guilty in return for life without parole.\nAs a deterrent to terrorism, the federal death penalty has been meaningless. It did nothing to prevent the Oklahoma City bombing, the 9/11 attacks, or ideologically motivated lone wolves like Nidal Malik Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, or the Tsarnaevs. Meanwhile, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other 9/11 conspirators will not be tried under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, since the same politicians who clamor for the death penalty as a deterrent to terrorists are unwilling to entrust Guantánamo prisoners to US courts.\nWhether the federal government will even have a mechanism for executing Tsarnaev is now a matter of debate. The last terrorist bomber to be executed was McVeigh, killed by lethal injection in Indiana in June 2001. At his execution, news reporters noted tears streaming from one otherwise-immobile eye. Those tears caught the attention of Columbia University anesthesiologist Dr. Mark Heath, who recognized them not as a sign of emotion, but as an indication that the pain-masking sedative in the government’s three-drug cocktail was wearing off. McVeigh was still paralyzed, but now in unspeakable agony.\nFrom those tears flowed 14 years of medical-journal and law-review articles, lawsuits, and worldwide alarm about lethal injections. International pressure led drug companies to refuse to supply the cocktail’s ingredients to state corrections departments. During the Tsarnaev trial, the lethal-injection debate reached the Supreme Court, with the justices heatedly arguing over whether the use of substitute chemicals, acquired from shadowy suppliers, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\nHowever the Court rules on lethal injection, there’s no denying that the politics of crime and punishment have undergone a sea change. In a new libertarian wave, Congress, the president, and state legislatures are variously ratcheting down the “war on drugs,” reversing three-strikes laws, and trying to shutter overcrowded and expensive prisons. In 1994, Clinton Democrats played the federal death-penalty card to retain their hold in divided states. But since then, the country has continued a slow, steady march in the opposite direction. Six states, including four that today have Republican governors—New Jersey, New Mexico, Maryland, and Illinois—have renounced the death penalty. Meanwhile, three of Hillary Clinton’s rivals—Chafee, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders—oppose capital punishment. Chafee and O’Malley, who abolished the death penalty as governor, both issued statements of respect for the Boston jury’",

        "prompt": "CINCINNATI -- A building that was once part of the historic Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. complex in Over-the-Rhine will become home to a new craft brewery and distillery this summer.\nThe yet-to-be-named brewery and distillery will open inside the former Moerlein icehouse at 108 Henry St. by June or July, according to two of its co-founders, David Berger and Bryan Becker.\nBerger's wife, a family friend Damon Kresa and head brewer Tom Cox are also partners in the venture, which will feature a tap and tasting room, event space, 20-barrel capacity brewhouse and copper stills.\nThe group is working with students in a senior-level marketing class at Miami University to develop a strategic business plan. Students are helping to choose the brewery and distillery's name, building its website, creating logos, launching social media and researching future distribution of its beers and spirits.\n\"To be able to be hands-on in a real-life situation, to work alongside an actual company, is just something you can’t get from a traditional classroom,\" said Angela Cortright, the project manager responsible for coordinating the work of her fellow marketing students. \"We’re basically applying everything we learned the past four years in this capstone class.\"\nCortright said the class hopes to announce the brewery and distillery's official name by the first week of March.\nMeanwhile, the business owners are working to remodel the five-story icehouse, which was built in 1891. They installed the brewhouse and a test still on the building's first floor in January. The tasting and tap room will be located on the first floor as well.\nThe partners received their license from the Ohio Division of Liquor Control on Feb. 6 to begin brewing and distilling on-site. The distilling portion of the business will take advantage of changes made to Ohio's liquor laws last year, allowing distilleries to sell cocktails made from their spirits on-site. Previously, Ohio distilleries could serve only small samples of their products during tours.\nThe distillery will make gin, vodka and whiskey alongside barrel-aged bourbon. Using research gathered by the Miami students, the owners hope to start self-distributing their beer to local bars before the taproom opens.\nThe owners plan to turn the building's two-story-deep basement, which Moerlein used to store its beer, into an event and barrel-aging space.\nDavid Berger, left, gives a tour of the former Christian Moerlein icehouse basement.\nThe icehouse building is located about a block away from the former Moerlein bottling plant, which is now home to Rhinegeist Brewery at 1910 Elm St. Prohibition forced the original Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. to cease its entire brewery operation in 1919.\nThe Moerlein icehouse can be seen near the top right corner of this photo taken in the early 1900s.\nBerger said his family purchased the",
        "baseline": " property in 1995 and leased it out to other businesses until a couple of years ago.\n“We were real involved in Over-the-Rhine for 18 years,” said Berger, whose family operated a cigar business in Cincinnati for seven generations.\nWhen the last tenants left the Henry Street building, Berger said it made sense to enlist his friends and set up the distillery there.\nBecker, a chemical engineer, said the group originally planned to open only a distillery in Over-the-Rhine. When the partners started outlining their initial plans, though, they realized the potential pitfalls of focusing solely on making bourbon.\nThat's when they decided to make craft beer as well.\n\"When we came back and looked at that, we realized you utilize similar equipment for both processes,\" Berger said.\nBerger then contacted Cox, an award-winning home brewer and member of the Terrace Park Brewing Co. cooperative, to head the beer-making operation.",

I asked my OB the same evening when I could start trying again!\"\nSoon after, she received some news she wasn't expecting.\nAfter some tests, doctors discovered that Bowman's fertility issues stemmed from a rare condition known as \"unicornuate uterus\" -- a uterine malformation which left her born with just half a uterus, one ovary, and a single fallopian tube.\n\"The diagnosis was frightening for me,\" Bowman tells CafeMom, \"but my reproductive endocrinologist was absolutely confident that regardless of my previous outcomes, I absolutely could carry a baby to term ... so I continued on my journey.\"\nNext came four more cycles of interuterine insemination (IUI) and then a round of IVF, until finally, Bowman learned she was once again pregnant -- with twins!\nHer excitement, however, was mixed with fear. She'd already endured the loss of twins once -- what if she lost these babies, too?\nBowman says she tried to stay positive, despite her concerns. But at 17 weeks, one of her worst fears was realized, when doctors told her they'd lost the heartbeat of her son, James.\n\"Every week I went in for my weekly ultrasounds expecting the worst and hoping for the best,\" says Bowman. \"I made small milestones for myself and tried to take things hour by hour, day by day.\"\nThough the loss of James was unbelievably heartbreaking, Bowman says the birth of Leti gave her new hope -- and the strength to carry on.\nBowman continued to carry both babies until February 12, 2019, when they were born via C-section.\n\"Hearing her cry was the biggest relief I have had in my entire life,\" she says. \"My mother was in the OR with me and kept telling me how perfect she was. She brought her over to me and I couldn't believe I was looking at the most perfect angel that ever existed.\"\nLeti had two small birthmarks on her forehead, which her mom says almost look like tiny footprints.\n\"To me they are her brother's stamp that he is watching over her, his little footprints to note that he will always be with her,\" Bowman says.\nWhen the hospital chaplain brought baby James to the recovery room a few hours later, Bowman says \"a flood of emotion\" washed over her, as well as memories of losing her first twins, whom she'd named Buchanan and Lenor (Nori).\n\"The tears were flowing,\" she says, adding that unfortunately, due to James's condition, she was unable to take photos with him.\nBut the new mom knew right away that she wanted to honor baby James's short life. She just wasn't sure at first how she'd do it.\n\"I wanted to honor him like I did with my other twins and tattoo his footprints on my wrist next to his siblings, but was unable to,\" Bowman says. \"But at the end of the day, I got to see him, touch him and say goodbye. I knew I had to grieve him again, but also focus on my beautiful daughter who I could hold in my arms.\"\nIt wasn't long before Bowman contacted photographer Jessica Young, and asked about setting up a newborn photo shoot for Leti -- which sparked an idea.\nBefore the shoot, Bowman told Young about the heartbreaking loss of James, and the story touched the photographer so deeply, she wanted to find a way to bring his memory into the session.\nWhen Bowman showed up to Young's studio on February 27, she was overcome with emotion when she saw the scene that greeted her. Next to a small wooden cradle for Leti to lay in was a matching one for James -- complete with a blue swaddle and tiny pair of angel wings carefully placed inside.\n\"I had not done anything like that before,\" Young tells CafeMom. \"I have done sessions for rainbow babies but not one honoring a lost twin.\"\nYoung says that although she knew she wanted to incorporate angel wings into the photo somehow, it wasn't until she was setting up that she began toying with the idea of weaving pink and blue swaddle blankets together to show the twins' unbreakable bond.\nThe photo has been making its way around Facebook in the weeks since Young first shared it, and it's striking a chord with people everywhere.\n\"Your portrait really conveys the loss in a touching way,\" wrote one user, while hundreds of others added just how simultaneously beautiful and heartbreaking the image is.\nBowman says she's stunned by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support she's received from strangers.\n\"I am shocked how it has been received and how viral it has gone,\" she tells CafeMom. \"What started",
        "baseline": " out as a simple way to honor my son has gone on to touch so many people's lives.\"\nShe's also shared the image with private Facebook groups of women trying to conceive with the same uterine abnormalities she faces. Her hope, she says, is that it \"helps someone else understand that this is possible for people like me.\"\nIn the meantime, Bowman's devoted to the little ray of sunshine to come out of all this: Leti, whose middle name is James, in honor of her brother.\nBut that's not the only way she's keeping his memory alive. She's also enlarged the now-viral photo Young took and placed it in her daughter's nursery.\n\"We will always talk about him and celebrate his birthday as much as hers,\" Bowman says. \"I want her to know how much her mom wanted both her and her brother here, and how important he is to both of our lives as he is watching down over us with her other siblings.\"",

        "prompt": "Yoshihiro Uchida celebrated his 92nd birthday on Sunday.\nEven more impressive is that for 66 of his years, Uchida has been coaching judo at San Jose State University. He built the program into a national power and has almost single-handedly elevated the stature and visibility of judo in the United States.\nUchida, a Japanese-American, has also been a model of determination and has had a knack for transforming obstacles into opportunity and using an opponent’s momentum to his advantage.\nLast month Uchida watched proudly as San Jose State hosted the national collegiate judo championships and his Spartans won their 45th championship in 51 years. This summer, one of his athletes, Marti Malloy, will represent the United States at the Olympics in London.\nAs important as judo has been to Uchida, his life has been framed by other events. While he served in the United States Army during World War II, his family was sent to American internment camps. Because of his heritage, he struggled to find work after the war, but he eventually founded successful businesses. And he has never quit working or coaching.\nUchida was born April 1, 1920, in Calexico, Calif., the third of five children. He grew up in Garden Grove, helping grow strawberries and tomatoes. At 10 he learned judo, part of a traditional method for Japanese parents in America to instill their culture in young men.\nIn 1940, Uchida enrolled at San Jose State, where he studied chemical engineering and was student-coach of the physical education department’s judo program. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was drafted into the Army, where he served in the medical corps as a laboratory technician.\nFor a generation of Japanese-Americans, the American dream disintegrated on Feb. 19, 1942. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to the removal of about 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans from the West Coast during the war. Uchida’s parents were incarcerated at a camp in Arizona; his brothers were sent to the Tule Lake Relocation Center in Northern California; his sister and her husband were sent to an internment camp in Idaho.\nReminders of that have never left. In fact, the building on campus that now houses the judo dojo — renamed Yoshihiro Uchida Hall in 1997 — was a processing center for internment camps.\nLike African-American soldiers serving during World War II, American-born Japanese who were United States citizens — Nisei — served in segregated units where they were subjected to much of the same racist treatment.\nUchida recalled an episode in 1942 at Camp Crowder in Missouri when a burly white soldier confronted a group of Nisei and referred to them as Japs. Uchida, who stood 5 feet 5 inches, took offense and challenged the soldier. A scuffle ensued, and Uchida took down the stunned soldier with a judo throw. “I was a hero in the barracks,” he said.\nAfter four years of service, Uchida returned to San Jose State and earned a degree in biological science. He also resumed teaching and taught judo to police candidates.\nFortunately, a friend who was a supervisor for the county had a friend at O’Connor Hospital and arranged for Uchida to be hired as a lab technician in the emergency room, where he worked the overnight shift. Uchida eventually became a lab supervisor at San Jose Hospital.\nHis passion remained judo, and his crusade was to help establish it as a sport sanctioned by the Amateur Athletic Union, which, with the help and influence of Henry Stone, the judo and wrestling coach at California, came about in 1953.\nThat year, San Jose State sponsored the first nationwide A.A.U. championships. In 1962, Uchida organized the first national collegiate judo championships, which San Jose State won. (Judo is still not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A.) He and Stone helped judo become an Olympic event, and Uchida was the coach of the United States’ first Olympic judo team, which competed at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo and won a bronze medal.\nAs a Japanese-American, “to be elevated to coach an American Olympic team was something you never dreamed of,” Uchida said.\nWilliam C. Rhoden talks with Yoshihiro Uchida, judo coach at San Jose State for 66 years and of the first United States Olympic judo team, who has no plans to retire.\nJudo was not enough to sustain Uchida and his young family, however. Unable to get a home loan because of insufficient income, Uchida, who was still teaching judo, went into business on his own. He bought a failing medical laboratory from an acquaintance in 1957 for $3,000, putting $75 down and paying the balance in increments. Using friendships and connections with doctors he had worked with, Uchida turned the business into a profitable venture. Part of the profits kept San Jose State judo afloat.\nDuring the next three decades, Uch",

They built a sprawling $80 million complex of housing and commercial units in San Jose’s Japantown, converting an eyesore into an impressive community.\nAfter more than nine decades of living, Uchida said, chief among the many lessons he has learned is that if you have a cause or a mission, determination alone is not sufficient to see it through.\nUchida uses the internment camps as an example of what can happen to the uninvolved. He recalled how Japanese-Americans were scapegoated and stereotyped and became the target of unfounded suspicions.\nUchida added: “Sometimes, you get kicked around. But if you believe in it, just keep pushing ahead. You might have to find out how to get there by going backward and then coming back again.",

        "prompt": "Combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to have dementia, cardiac problems and structural changes in the brain as they get older than veterans without PTSD, according to new research.\nThe findings, which for the most part resulted from research at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, raise concerns about the overall health of aging veterans, but hold promise for the potential of helping to treat these diseases.\n\"Our concern is that veterans who honorably serve our country ... are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and over the next 10 to 20 years we will see a lot of Alzheimer's in the veteran population,\" said Dr. Michael Weiner, director of the Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nThe impact of combat on the brain as it ages will be at the center of the fourth annual \"Brain at War\" conference Thursday at the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco.\nMuch of the research to be presented during the daylong conference was conducted at the city's Veterans Affairs hospital and funded through San Francisco's Northern California Institute for Research and Education, the largest VA research institute in the country and the nation's leading neuroscience research institute.\nOf the 2 million Americans who have served in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, at least 400,000. or as much as 20 percent, have developed or are at risk of developing PTSD, a psychological condition caused by exposure to severe trauma.\nSome 23 million veterans, like many people, will later face more common illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's, as a function of aging. But a growing body of work shows these diseases may be exacerbated by traumatic stress, the researchers found.\nFor example, veterans with PTSD are two to three times more likely to develop heart disease than those who do not have the disorder.\n\"These are young men and women, most of whom do not yet have heart disease,\" said Dr. Beth Cohen, a staff physician at the hospital, in a statement about her research. \"If we can learn why they are at greater risk now, we can find ways to help avoid heart disease later in life.\"\nUnlike heart disease, no effective ways to prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease yet exist, but researchers are studying soldiers' brains to learn more about how combat-related stress affects the brain's biology and increases the chance of developing Alzheimer's.\nThey have found that a section of the hippocampus - the part of the brain that is devoted to short-term memory and learning new things - is significantly smaller in veterans with PTSD. Researchers are trying to determine if this smaller section can grow over time with therapy and treatment for stress.\n\"It's possible new stem cells, new brain cells are made, or it's possible the existing neurons or cells get plumper or have more synapses and connection,\" said Weiner, also professor of medicine, radiology, psychiatry and neurology at UCSF. \"Nobody knows. Our ability to probe the brain and understand these mechanisms is really limited.\"\nWeiner and his colleagues at the VA hope their research will help veterans like 37-year-old Ben Sykes, who enlisted in the Marine Corps after Sept. 11, 2001, and was among the first troops to move into Baghdad and then into Saddam Hussein's primary palace in Tikrit in 2003.\nWhen Sykes returned to civilian life and his previous career as an interaction Web designer, he found himself trying to re-create the intensity of combat through drinking and extreme sports.\n\"I have read the greatest pharmacy on the planet is your hypothalamus,\" said Sykes, referring to the part of the brain responsible for certain metabolic processes and secretion of some hormones. \"It changes your body's chemistry. I was hooked and was just looking for the next rush.\"\nSykes did not recognize his classic symptoms of PTSD until his family pushed him to get help. Now, after years of therapy and treatment at the VA, Sykes believes he has",
        "baseline": " few lingering effects other than an occasional feeling of impending panic that comes when he smells burning odors or realizes he's seated with his back to a door.\nStill, he is grateful for how far he's come and appreciates the continued work of the VA in researching the long-term health effects of PTSD on veterans.\n\"Humans are amazing in the sense they adapt to anything,\" he said.\nPTSD and heart disease: Veterans of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who have been diagnosed with PTSD and other mental health issues have two to three times the rate of heart disease risk factors compared with veterans without those diagnoses.\nPTSD and the hippocampus: Research using magnetic resonate imaging, or MRI, at the VA hospital have shown the hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores memory, is significantly smaller in the brains of veterans with PTSD.\nPTSD and dementia: Older veterans with PTSD are almost twice as likely as veterans without such trauma to develop dementia.",

An internal audit helps you locate areas where your business can save time and money by examining the day-to-day tasks of workers and pointing out areas for improvement. Audits also identify areas of waste in the business and fraudulent spending or improper transactions by employees. On your path to long-term success, make an internal audit a regular investment – it will pay off in the end.\nSmall businesses lose millions every year to employee theft. Types of fraud committed by employees include skimming payments from customers, check tampering, cash theft, misuse of company credit cards and improper payroll transactions.\nYou may believe your business lacks the staff to create an internal audit policy or carry out audits to combat these problems. However, even with a small staff, you can create a program for monitoring work and their behavior. In fact, announcing a policy of internally auditing financial transactions may keep an employee from misusing company resources.\nA formal internal audit includes tasks besides detecting fraud. Examining policies and procedures on a regular basis ensures your business minimizes its exposure to fraud and other losses. Examining credit lines extended to customers is one such area of loss prevention. If you have formulated a policy regarding extension of credit, internal audits test compliance with that policy. Designing a credit policy with the intention of reducing bad debt does no good if not followed.\nOperational audits examine the practices of a company, instead of its finances. Is your business operating at maximum efficiency? Ineffective operations add to overhead without increasing profit. An operational audit may reveal these inefficiencies or point to time lost on unnecessary paperwork.\nIs your business following applicable regulations? Finding out you do not comply with a government regulation before the government helps your business avoid fines or other legal",

Internal audit performs a vital service in reviewing these functions.\nYour small business likely cannot afford to create an internal audit department, but with careful planning, you can create a system for checking up on your company and its workers. This less formal system can still provide the information you need to improve your operations and financial controls. Such an internal audit requires two people working as a team. This avoids personality conflicts and prevents the auditor from simply checking his own work. It also provides an opportunity for the team members to discuss results and prepare an objective report to ownership.\nThomas, Jeffrey. \"The Importance of the Internal Audit Function in a Company.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-internal-audit-function-company-21496.html. 07 March 2019.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Having an External Audit?",

        "prompt": "The final instalment in the trilogy of climate change reports from the IPCC is released today. And there's some good news: the world can afford to transition to clean energy and climate change can be averted without sacrificing our living standards.\n• The cheapest and best way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to abandon fossil fuels over the next 10 years. Clean energy would have to treble in output by 2050.\n• Fracking could be an important intermediary measure as the energy mix moves to become cleaner, but only if coal is abandoned.\n• Fears that cutting carbon would destroy the economy were dismissed. The report calculated that moving from fossil fuels to renewables would reduce expected annual economic growth rates by 0.06%.\nWe've collected reactions from thought leaders and experts here.\nIt is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living. It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too.\nThe [IPCC] report provides sobering insight as to how urgent and substantial the challenge of reducing our emissions will be to best ensure we can limit warming to 2°C. While those challenges may initially appear daunting, it’s important to focus on the menu of solutions the report outlines. Furthermore, the report finds that there are significant “co-benefits” of reducing emissions, which make mitigation action even more imperative. For example, the report shows that low-emissions pathways not only reduce countries’ vulnerability to energy price volatility and supply disruptions, they produce significant benefits for human health and ecosystems by curbing air pollution.\nWe may be on the wrong emissions pathway now, but with ambitious action, there is still a chance to move onto the right one. Now is the time for governments at all levels to adopt comprehensive climate policies and invest in a low-carbon future — so that we don’t end up paying the price later.\nChina could break the deadlock in UN climate talks by presenting an ambitious new target with binding emissions cuts. If China leads, the US and the EU will have no excuse for not being more progressive. The test of whether governments are willing to act on the IPCC’s findings or turn their backs on",
        "baseline": " public concern will come during next year’s climate treaty talks in Paris.\nInvestors now have scientific evidence that if you put your money into fossil fuels you are complicit in wrecking our future. We know that 80% of fossil fuels need to stay underground in order to avoid a climate catastrophe.

        "prompt": "I am not writing to complain or to file a complaint. I do have concerns though. I have been a resident of Petersburg for three plus years. I live on the on the 400 block of Hinton Street. A couple of months ago our family cat was killed by a pack of dogs. This past week another of our cats was killed by the same pack of dogs. After the first kill, my wife called animal control. Animal control said the truck they use would not be available until 9 a.m. My wife told them the dogs were on my back porch. My question here is the advice from animal control about trapping and I can't understand why an officer was not sent by to see for themselves that these dogs were loose. Anyway, in the end nothing was done.\nDuring the second kill at 4 a.m. the same dogs were loose. My wife and I tried to chase them away but my wife slipped and fell and almost broke her ankle. Our next door neighbor who just moved here witnessed the entire event. I proceeded to follow the dogs in my car for over an hour until they arrived at their residence. These dogs terrorized other animals all along their trek. The dogs in question live on Upper Appomattox Street. Much to my chagrin there was an Animal Control Van one house",
        "baseline": " away from the dog's residence. I personally have observed at least six dogs on this property. The animals are inside and outside. The dogs seem to be getting out from the back of the property. The most aggressive dog is a female mongrel/hound mix.\nI am an animal lover but when dogs run in packs like these and you can't get a proper response from authorities a person is left with no choice but to handle the issue themselves. I have been by the property several times and it is a fire hazard in the making. Junk is everywhere. I was trying to make contact with the owner. These dogs are aggressive!\nMuch to my dismay, I was forced to purchase a shotgun to handle future attacks. I will protect my family and animals.\nUpdate: My neighbor and I have since moved out of Petersburg, yet I still see the dogs are loose and killing as usual. The report on the four sheep killed sounds like the same dogs that are allowed to run.",
