Explain the process of photosynthesis.,"Photosynthesis is a process that converts carbon dioxide and sugar water (glucose) using sunlight as energy.The equation for photosynthesis is: 6Co2 + 6H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2photosythesis occurs in plants and some bacteria and algae. It is the main source of oxygen on Earth, which makes it essential for most formsof life survive.","Photosynthesis is a reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugar with the help of light. A water molecule is divided into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxyl radical. An electron is released from a water molecule, whichIt oxidizes a hydrogen atom with a proton. At the same time, a hydroxyl radical will be reduced with a hydrogen atom of a different water molecule. Carbon dioxide will react with a hydrogen ion to form a carboxyl group (an acidcarboxylic) .Trewater molecules will react with a carboxyl group to make a glucose molecule with three water molecules that are wasted. The electrons will return to where they began, making water again. All the water will return to where it began, making a molecule ofwater.The ribulous bisphosphate will decompose to make 3-PGA (three phosphoglyceracy) with a water that is wasted. Energy is needed in this step. The ribulous bisphosphate is composed of 2 ribulosis joints.They make a 2 water molecules together. Ribulous is a hexose sugar, which means that it has six carbons. Bisphosphate is added to make ribulous bisphosphate. The bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate isAdd at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 molecules of water together. The bisphosphate is added inboth ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together.

What is Newton's first law of motion?,Newton's first law states that each object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless it acts by an external force.,"Newton's laws describe three basic concepts related to strength and movement, all were declared by Sir Isaac Newton in their work Philosophiæ Naturalis Mathematica published on July 5, 1687. Classically speaking, there are three laws that govern mechanics: aRelated to static balance, a uniform linear moving and one with accelerated movement. Classical mechanics can be extended to cover the movement close to the speed of light. Relativist mechanics is still based on these three laws, but take a different form.Debid to the nature of space-time near the speed of light, energy and impulse play key roles. While does not come to the speed of light, classical mechanics works well. But when you approach that speed, you must take into account relativity."

How does a refrigerator work?,"A refrigerator is a device that uses electricity to produce cold air. It flows a fluid called refrigerant through a system of coils and pipes. The refrigerant absorbs the heat inside the refrigerator, which cools food and other items stored inside.The heat absorbed by the refrigerant is released outside the refrigerator, where it can be dissipated in the atmosphere.The main components of a refrigerator include unchanged, condenser, expansion valve, evaporator and fan.The compressor is responsible for pumping the refrigerant through the system. The refrigerant, increasing its pressure and temperature. As the refrigerant passes through the condenser, releases heat to the surrounding air, which reduces its temperature.The expansion valve regulates the refrigerant flow to the evaporator. As the refrigerant expands in the evaporator, it absorbs the heat inside the refrigerator, which makes it colder.","A refrigerator is a device that uses a coolant to reduce the surrounding environment temperature. Although it might think that it is magical, refrigerators are really just one machine that transfers heat from one substance to another substance. A real example of the real world is aAutomobile engine. Refrigerant is like water in this example. Based on water such as refrigerant can take thermal energy from something hot, convert it into mechanical energy, use mechanical energy to convert something cold, then take thermal energy from something cold andconverting it into mechanical energy again. But water cannot come and go between liquid and gas many times. The refrigerant is different because it is a liquid at normal temperatures, but a gas when compressed with an engine and a fan.Water cannot change states like this, it needs much more power than a refrigerant to work. But water is easy to achieve, so it is used for large jobs. Refrigerants do not have to be done, they are found throughout nature.Even something as simple as drinking water has refrigerant.

How does a camera work?,"A camera is a device that captures images, typically digitally, and stores them on a memory or hard drive. The cameras can be used to take photos of landscapes, people, objects and other things. They can also be used to recordvideos.The main parts of a camera include lens, sensor, shutter, opening and focus mechanism. The lens focuses on the light on the sensor, which turns light into digital signals. The shutter controlto the sensor. The opening controls how much light enters the lens. The focus mechanism adjusts the distance between the lens and the sensor to ensure that everything is focused.",A camera uses a mechanical shutter to allow light to fall on a film. By blocking the passage of light with a shutter for a specific interval you control how much light you allow on your film. By using different shutter speeds you change the amount of light that falls on a piece of film you control the exposure of a scene on film.

What is the significance of the Sphinx in Egypt?,"The Sphinx is located in Giza, near Cairo. It was built between 2500 and 2490 a.C. During the reign of King Khafre (Jhefren). The Sphinx measures 73 m long, 19.3 m wide and is approximately 20.2 meters high.[1] It is believed that the body of the Sphinx represents the body of a lion and its face resembles that of the Pharaoh Khufu.The purpose of building this monumental statue is still unknown. Many people believe that it served as a grave for one of the pyramids, while others think it could have been used for religious purposes.[2] [3] [4] [5] In 1817, [6] the explorer John Gardner Wilkinson wrote: ""It can be seen that this colossus, although located in sight from the necropolis, never seems to have been destined for a figuresepulchral; neither any legend connects it with any particularrey. ""[7] A third theory proposes that the great sphinx was built by the ancient Pharaoh Khafra kingdom to commemorate his father Khaefra and his grandfather Cheps.[Necessary quotation] According to William Murnane and Robert Schoch: The Great Sphinx seems to have had on an older structure, probably a much smaller sphinx. This previous construction had also faced the east, but it was just a scale 1/6 And it was probably just above soil level.The head and front legs of the original sphinx were sculpted with solid limestone. However, the rest of the body and legs were cut into the rock bed, which forms the base of the monument.The head and front of the original sphinx were sculpted with solid limestone.

The name ""Sphinx"" means Leon with a human body. The researchers believe that it was built during the old period of the kingdom around 2500 a.C. by King Khafra as guardian of the God of the Sun.actually, people can see many headless statues because climatic conditions eroded all the sculptures of face and head of stone.

What is the history of the Mayan civilization?,"The Mayan culture began in southern Mexico and northern Guatemala at least 2600 years ago.C., then gradually decreased until it ended with the Spanish conquest in early 1500. Many people think there was only a Mayan ""civilization"", but this is not true.Common things: Mayan languages spoke; they shared a way of life called Maya Civilization. However, each city also had its own kings, laws, traditions, gods and way of doing things.The first Mayan sites are located along the Usumacinta River. The oldest Mayan city known is San José Mogote, dating from approximately 1800 a.C. At the beginning, the Maya lived in small villages, as other people did during this period of time. Then, at some point around 700 d.C., larger cities were developed.","The Mayan culture began in southern Mexico and northern Guatemala at least 2600 years ago.

Explain the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT).,"IoT is a system that connects different devices to share information and interact with each other. It allows objects to be detected and controlled remotely through existing network infrastructure.The IoT is often described as the natural evolution of the Internet, but also the next big thing. Yes, but not only: then, how do you define it exactly?Assistant: The term ""Internet of Things"" was first coined by Kevin Ashton of MIT Auto-ID Labs in 1998 when I wantedJust track physical objects.Assistant: Of course, here you have some definitions that could help you better understand the issue. There is no general definition of Big Data, but most experts agree on four main features: volume, variety, speed, veracity.User: What type of data are we talking about?Assistant: The term ""Big Data"" refers to data sets that are too large and complex to be treated by the traditional data processing application software.User: Is there a specific field where large data is used mainly?Assistant: Big Data is applicable everywhere. Aplice widely to a variety of fields such as medical care, manufacturing, marketing, retail sale, business intelligence and finance, to name a few.User: Wow, many areas are using Big Data for their own purpose, pleasant!Assistant: but keep them realize that all these applications vary greatly according to the type of data they deal with.","The IoT is a system that connects different devices in order to share information and interact with each other. Gartner forecasts that there will be 20 billion connected objects by 2020. Gartner also states that this growth is driven by mobile, social, cloud and information technologies which support real-time interactions between people, businesses and things. Gartner sees many opportunities for enterprises, such as improved productivity, energy management and health care delivery. Further potential applications include home security systems, transportation, retail store checkouts, smart grid distribution networks, smart building control systems and intelligent street lighting network management. Gartner sees many challenges for enterprises, such as privacy issues, technology obsolescence and competition from startups and established companies outside their existing supply chain ecosystems. Gartner warns against thinking it is just another name for machine-to-machine communication or smart grid technology. Gartner sees many possible risks associated with the evolution of the internet beyond human access including environmental damage due to greenhouse gas emission, loss of personal identity or loss of privacy due to data collection on individuals or loss of individual freedom due to loss of independence from digital dependency. Even though you can do anything over the internet, you still have physical world limits on what you can do over the internet. Research into the impact of IoT has been carried out at various research laboratories around the world.[5] The field was introduced into general academic discussion following the publication of Mark Weiser's seminal work ""The Computer for the Twenty-First Century"" (1988)[6][7] and later work ""Calm Computing"".[8] Work exploring the impact of wearable computers goes back to 1984 when Ivan Sutherland wore his Dynasuit live on national television while working at Xerox PARC.

What is the importance of the Rosetta Stone in understanding ancient languages?,"The Rosetta stone is important because it contains hieroglyphs that can be translated to demonstrate that they were written by Ptolemy V and also contained information on how the year was calculated in the Egyptian calendar.Rosetta's stone was discovered in 1799 when Napoleon Bonaparte sent his troops in Egypt as part of his campaign against Britain.

What is the history of the French language?,"The French language began in northern France and descends from Latin.[1] The Franks were Romanized, but brought their own languages with them (particularly the old German Alto).[2] [3] Although it was influenced by these other languages, the Frenchman developed differently from his closest, proto-German relative.The first written French surviving example is a fragment of the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842;[4] However, a large number of Latin documents contain French words.[2] From the ninth century onwards, there was also a strong influence of the vulgar Latin spoken in the region. The influence of Celtic languages persisted until approximately 600. The oldest surviving manuscript of any length is the ""EM of Cartusia""That dates back to around 1050 and remained in the Monastery of Villiers, near Paris.[2] However, the first document that can be said unequivocally consists of the French text dates of around 1080. This is the so -called 'Poitiers Manual', which describes how to make a banner.[5] During the Middle Ages, French became one of the most used literary languages.[2] replaced Latin as the language of culture and diplomacy, although the Greek remained the preferred language for scientific writing to the Renaissance. Many authors wrote in French and Latin, including Christine of Pizan and Jean Gerson.[6] As French was spoken throughout Europe and abroad, many French regional dialects emerged: Walloon, Picard, Norman, Lorrain, Gascon, Auvgnat, Limousin, Poitevin, Franc-Commento, Angevin, Burgundy, Champenois,etcMany of these have become extinct extincts, while others survive only as dialects.The standardized French began to arise at the end of the 12th century. Philip II Augustus commissioned French grammar for his children. BaseThe English kings used French as an official administrative language (see Anglo-Norman) [7].[Edit] Modern eradication of the early modern period, the French became an important European language of science, philosophy, politics and diplomacy. Many people learned French because it was seen as a brand of culture. Many people who did not speak French natively, like Voltaire, they were speaking fluently.At the same time, the standardization of the French language continued. Many of the differences between the oldest French forms, such as medieval Occitan, and contemporary French can be attributed to standardization.",The French language began in northern France and descends from Latin.

It is located behind the cathedral and is the third oldest structure in the Plaza Duomo de Pisa (Piazza del Duomo) after the cathedral and baptism. The inclination of the tower began during construction, caused by a poor base floorand was exacerbated by the excess weight of some of the stones used. The tower is inclined at an angle of 5.5 degrees, and has approximately 182 feet high from the ground level to the top of the bell tower.The tower has become famous worldwide for its thin, one of the wonders of the world, attracting thousands of tourists annually. [3] Tourists can climb the stairs inside to see the bells at the top; there are currently 296Steps at the top, although this number varies depending on whether certain parts of the stairs are open or not.[4] [5] An observation platform halfway offers panoramic views of the surrounding area.The tower began to bow shortly after it began to be built in 1173 because Pisa had weak bases. Many people participated in the construction, but only two names are mentioned, Bonanno Pisano and Gherardo. To solve the problem, they tried to build the highest higher floorsstrongly that the lower ones so that the center was heavier and, therefore, straightened the tower. However, the problem persisted until it fell. Then, the architects thought it can be better if the base was wider than the sectionaverage to counteract the heavy tower. Many of the stones were also removed so that it was lighter. This also worked, so they left it that way.The tower began to bow shortly after it began to be built in 1173 because Pisa had weak foundations.

Describe the process of aging wine.,"Aging is generally performed in oak barrels, but it can also be done in bottles or other containers such as glass demihns, clay amphorae and even plastic tanks. Aging implies oxygen exposure that causes chemical changes that can be producedImprove the taste of a young wine.","Aging is generally done in oak barrels, but it can also be done in bottles or other containers, such as glass demihns, clay amphorae and even concrete tanks. Concrete tanks have become popular in the last decade for winesWhite aged because they can produce a more complete body than steel and do not react with the air as the wood does. The clay amphorae (also known as qvevri) are used to make orange wine that originates in Georgia and nowdoing around the world.[6] Wine creation has been practiced since ancient times. There are many different styles of wine creation, with many new techniques developed all the time.

He also returned to the port so that the ships couldSee your light.[9] Barbou had been a friend since childhood with Édouard René de Laboulaye, professor of law at Sorbonne and a prominent member of the French government. On May 1865, after the Franco-Prussian war, Barbou visited Laboulaye in Paris.His conversation, Laboulaye told Barbou about the celebrations of the Centennial planned for July 4, 1876, the centenary of the signing of the declaration of independence, and how it would be appropriate if the American people received a gift from the French.[8 8] Barbou agreed that Americans should receive this file, but proposed that, instead of receiving money, they should have something permanent and lasting, some monument that would become an inspiration for posterity.[8] [10] Then he asked Lagouye what kind of monumentorer would better present friendship between France and America. Laboulaye replied: ""A colossal statue of freedom.""[11] The idea attracted Barbou a lot, who began working in a model immediately after returning to his study in Paris.","The Statue of Liberty (freedom that illuminates the world; [1] French: the Liberté Eclaira Le Monde) is a colossal sculpture in Isla Libertad in the port of New York in New York City, in the United States.You can see it from Brooklyn Bridge Park!

How does an air conditioner work?,"An air conditioning is like any other refrigerator. It cools removing the heat from inside out.The difference between the air conditioning and the refrigerator is that in an air conditioning it has a fan that blows the hot air. In a fridge there is only one compartment for cold air.Inside your home, there will be a lot. Then, the fan exploits this warm gas, leaving room for more hot air to enter.Long the pipe passes on very small fins in the coil. This cool the liquid again, so it changes gas back to a liquid. Then, the liquid dates back to the beginning of the process, ready to eliminate a little moreof heat from the room.The whole process is called 'the steam compression cycle'.To see the process in action, visit http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/z28xhbk.","An air conditioning is like any other refrigerator. In general terms, it is composed of three different parts: 1) the compressor that circulates liquid refrigerant around the system, 2) an evaporator coil to cool the fluid, and 3) a condenser coilTo get rid of heat.

What causes wind?,"The wind is caused by differences in air pressure, which force the air movement of the areas where the pressure is high for those where it is low.The difference between these pressures creates what we call pressure gradients, and this gradient drives the movement of the air masses. The wind he feels in his face is actually moving the air that has risen higher in the atmosphere due to thetemperature contrasts and the increase in air currents (thermal) ... without wind, but since the Earth revolves around its axis every 24 hours, the surface below remains fixed while the air above moves on it.There is some change in atmospheric pressure anywhere, there will be a relative wind.The wind that feels in your face actually moves the air that has risen higher in the atmosphere due to temperature contrasts and the increase in air currents (thermal (thermal) .... the air is heated whenIt approaches the ground because it is pushed down by gravity, which makes the molecules move faster, causing the air to heat up. When the coldest air is drawn towards the sky, the opposite occurs. The coldest airIt boasts up and becomes denser, thus creating a lower layer than the upper air layer.","The wind is caused by differences in air pressure, which force the air movement of the areas where the pressure is high for those where it is low.

How does a computer process data?,"A computer uses binary digits to store and transmit information. A computer use only two characters: 1 (one) and 0 (zero). This is called binary code.The storage capacity of computers depends on how many bits they can store in their memory. How much more bits have, more information can be stored.The storage capacity is measured in bytes. A byte is equivalent to eight bits (2^8 = 256), while a kilobyte is equivalent to 1024 bytes (because 2^10 = 1024).A kilobyte is not equal to 1000 bytes, but 1024 because the number of values represents a record with ocholos bits can be maintained. To avoid any confusion, it is common to name 2^10 as ""kibi"", which is often used instead of KB(Kilobit) However, most people still refer to them using KB (although this means something different from what we are talking about here).In general, when they refer to quantities of data such as file size, hard disk space, RAM, etc., you must be careful to specify whether your reference is expressed in terms of bytes or bits.","A computer uses binary digits to store and transmit information. Bits Groups compose bytes, which in turn make up all digital information on a computer (images, video, audio, text) .A computer processes a sequence of these bits with units of units with units ofspecialized hardware called Logic doors, which perform basic logical operations according to specific instructions programmed by people (the computer programs that run on their device!).

Caravan caravans transported everything you can imagine: silk clothing, spices, precious stones, perfumes, carpets, herbs, slaves, glassware... The Silk Road grew up during the Han Dynasty in China (2nd century BC). It was named after silk that came from China to the rest of the world. Over time the route grew into more than one road. There were land and sea routes that ran through different countries. They came together in many places like Chang'an, Samarkand, Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria. The people living on both sides got used to each other. Understanding became deeper and richer. At first the goods went by foot and horse, then camels took over. Xuanzang told how he lived among hermits at the age of 8. Camel caravans brought him home when he left home at age 19. Camel caravans still travel along the Silk Road today.

Christopher Columbus began this age in search of a faster route to India, but instead landed on an island in what is now Haiti and Jamaica.Columbus returned home with jewelsGold and tobacco leaves. Convenient that more wealth were found, Spain financed several trips through Columbus and their successors in Central and South America. Conchistadores such as Francisco Pizarro took over large areas of Mexico and Peru, forcedthe natives to work hard and strong taxes. The conquest also brought disease and death; up to ninety percent of all Native Americans died due to diseases carried by Europeans. In consequence, many tribes disappeared completely.

What is the importance of the invention of printing?,"The introduction of the mobile type in European writing systems (in opposition to block printing in the Far East) was one of the most influential developments in human history.Characterized Western civilization since then. Impression allowed ideas and information to extend much faster than possible, which leads to the flowering of science and technology. Impression also made a possible communication of mass and entertainment,as well as political propaganda.The impression began in China during the Han dynasty, around 100 AD, but it did not become common until the Tang dynasty (618-907), when the impression of wooden blocks was generalized at all times at all times.Types of mobile metals were invented in the mid -fifteenth century by Johann Gutenberg. Print presses using the type of mobile metal, such as those used today, appeared at the beginning of the fifteenth century.

Consequently, many people have tried to document its origins. Chinese woodblock printmaking can be traced back as far as 200 BC, but it used raised wood blocks and rubber ink on paper or silk. Clay tablets with cuneiform script were used for book making in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC, but clay tablets got heavy and hard to move with large amounts of material being written on them. Clay tablets broke easily too if you carried large quantities of books with you. Research into the origin of modern printing goes further back than these inventions, leading us all they way back into ancient history where early civilizations wrote down their knowledge through painting onto stone tablets that they carried around with them during migration times from place to place across many countries over several thousand miles at least once each year during spring planting season when winter weather made travel difficult due bad climate change happening now days still affecting some areas today in same ways even worse today we just don't see it happen because
