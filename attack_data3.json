        "prompt": "OAKLAND, Calif. – No one game is critical, Scott Servais will tell you (and his players will faithfully echo), and yet this one loomed as a gigantic marker for the Mariners. Disaster was lurking around every corner, behind every pitch.\nA loss would have been, let’s face it, devastating.\nNot fatal, but about as damaging as you can get at this stage of a season that still hangs in the balance for Seattle. To get swept by the team you are chasing, an Oakland team that is starting to believe it is touched by a higher baseball power, well, that would have been hard to come back from.\nIt’s a moot point, for now, because the Mariners pulled out about as tense and vital a victory as there is in a month that isn’t September, October or November. They won on a home run by a guy who never hits them, on a pitching gem by a guy who has mastered the art of deception, on the backs of a bullpen that kept wriggling out of danger.\nThey won 2-0 on Wednesday, in 12 innings, over an A’s club that the Mariners know they must somehow disabuse of the notion that they are a team of destiny. It was a small nudge in that direction, after two forceful pushes backward by Oakland, but it prevented what could have been another in a series of crises of confidence by a fan base that is constantly on a CSI-like hunt for signs of capitulation by the Mariners.\nEvery pitch, every out. It was that kind of game, in a series of those kinds of games, the kind that the Mariners are resigned to playing all the way to the finish line, close and excruciatingly stressful. The kind of game that they had mastered at one point this year, but then so have the A’s, in fact turning the master’s degree into a Ph.D. and surging past Seattle.\nNo one had more fun on Wednesday than Gordon after he incongruously muscled a home run to right field in the 12th inning, just his second of the year, just the 13th of his career. Gordon nervously waited for the Oakland right fielder, Stephen Piscotty, to catch it, because that’s the way his luck has been going, but when he didn’t, Gordon danced around the bases behind Mike Zunino, who had walked.\nWith the preternaturally dominant Edwin Diaz lined up for the bottom of the inning, the Mariners knew that they likely had just won this game on the sweet stroke of their skinniest player. Gordon kissed his biceps – in the Bay Area, they called that Kaepernicking long before he ever knelt for the anthem – and was engulfed by his teammates in the dugout.\nIt’s down to 40 games for the Mariners now, and they sit 2 1/2 games behind Oakland for the second wild card. They have seven games still to play against the A’s as well as six against the Astros. Yes, the Mariners once led Oakland by 11 games, so there has been a 13 1/2 game turnaround in two months, but they are still within reach, if only they stop playing .750 ball.\nIf Seattle finishes out of the playoffs, yet again, as the M’s have every year since 2002, 17 years of ever-growing anguish, it will be, I maintain, the most maddening and frustrating moment in franchise history. They have had far worse seasons – more than 100 losses five times – but expectations were quickly trampled in those years. They have had agonizing finishes, such as the abrupt and premature end to their 116-win season of 2001. But you can’t get too melancholy about a year in which the team set a record for victories.\nThis time, they got their fan base to believe it was going to happen. They played so well early that a season without much anticipation or hype turned into one where the postseason suddenly seemed like an inevitability. In a way, they will be a victim of",

If it doesn’t happen, well, the wailing will be, I suspect, longer and louder than we’ve ever heard, this year’s team bearing the brunt of ever-mounting ill-will about the franchise’s longstanding shortcomings.\nBut there’s opportunity, as well. If they can pull it back together, the narrative can be transformed again. This year’s Mariners’ team can still be remembered as the one that broke the drought, that pulled itself out of a tailspin, that defied every prediction of its demise and far surpassed every forecast of the lackluster year they were supposed to have.\nThat’s what’s out there these next 40 games over the next six weeks – lots more days and nights like Wednesday, when it seemed as if everything was riding on that game.\nIt wasn’t, but who’s going to believe that?",

        "prompt": "(Reuters) - Five-time finalist Andy Murray fell in a five-set thriller against Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut in the opening round of the Australian Open on Monday, while top contenders Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal recorded comfortable victories.\nStruggling with a chronic hip injury, three-time Grand Slam champion Murray had the Melbourne crowd roaring when he came back from two sets down before losing 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(4) 6-2 in just over four hours.\nIn an emotional news conference on Friday, Murray said the Australian Open could be his last tournament but after the match he left ajar the door for a return next year.\n“If I want to go again, I’ll need to have a big operation, which there’s no guarantee I’ll be able to come back from anyway, but I’ll give it my best shot,” he added.\nDefending champion Federer cruised into the second round with a 6-3 6-4 6-4 win over Uzbek Denis Istomin.\nNadal, 17 times a Grand Slam winner, powered past local hope James Duckworth 6-4 6-3 7-5 to kickstart his campaign.\nAmerican John Isner became the first top-10 player to bite the dust when he was stunned by compatriot Reilly Opelka 7-6(4) 7-6(6) 6-7(4) 7-6(5).\nThe victory was world number 97 Opelka’s first in the main draw of a Grand Slam.\nIn the women’s draw, Caroline Wozniacki started her title defence with a 6-3 6-4 victory against Belgian Alison van Uytvanck.\nWorld number two Angelique Kerber moved into the second round with a 6-2 6-2 victory over Slovenia’s Polona Hercog, while Maria Sharapova raced past British qualifier Harriet Dart in a 6-0 6-0 win.\nRoger Federer, chasing a third consecutive Australian Open title, eased past Uzbek Denis Istomin 6-3 6-4 6-4 in the opening round.\nThe 37-year-old Swiss will face British qualifier Dan Evans, ranked 189 in the world, in the second round.\nFive-time finalist Andy Murray produced an inspired comeback in what could have been his final match but was eventually beaten by Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(4) 6-2.\nThe former world number one had announced on Friday that he could be forced retire this year due to a chronic hip problem.\nA dominant Caroline Wozniacki scythed down Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck 6-3 6-4 in 93 minutes to get her title defence off to a strong start.\nThe Dane, seeded third, hit four aces and won two out of seven break points in a controlled display to down her unseeded opponent and set up a match with Johanna Larsson.\nAndrea Petkovic was forced to retire from her opening match against Romania’s Irina-Camelia Begu after collapsing on court during the eighth game of the second set.\nThe tournament’s trainer and doctor were immediately called to treat the German who trailed in the second set after winning the opening set 7-6(3).\nPetkovic eventually got back on her feet and played another point before calling it a day.\nThe Czech, a runner-up in the Qatar Open this month, is participating in only his second tournament since the Queen’s Club championships last June but showed no signs of the problem as he dismantled Briton Edmund.\nGrigor Dimitrov said having eight-times major champion Andre Agassi in his corner as coach had not just sharpened his game but also improved his outlook on life.\n“I’m just a better person, period. On a daily basis, I have learned something new from him,” Dimitrov, who began working with the American great last October, said following his win over Janko Tipsarevic.\n“Sometimes some of the things he says... it has nothing to do with tennis. And today before the match we are talking about completely different stuff.\nNinth seed John Isner was stunned by his American compatriot Reilly Opelka, who secured a 7-6(4) 7-6(6) 6-7(4) 7-6(5) victory in a tight encounter between the towering pair.\nOpelka, ranked 102 in the world, moved into the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time.\nWimbledon champion Angelique Kerber hardly broke sweat in her clinical 6-2 6-2 victory over unseeded Polona Hercog. Up next for the world number two is Brazilian qualifier Beatriz Haddad Maia who beat Bernarda Pera in three sets to advance.\nJelena Ostapenko’s poor start to the season continued as the 2017 French Open champion was knocked out in the opening round at Melbourne by Greece’s Maria Sakkari.\nOstapenko, eliminated in the first round in her previous three tournaments, was beaten 6-1 3-6 6-2 by world number 41 Sakkari who scored her first career win over the Latvian to the delight of a noisy contingent of her compatriots.\nBulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov dropped the opening set tamely but regained his composure to power past unseeded Janko Tipsarevic 4-6 6-3 6-1 6-4.\nDimitrov, who struggled with an ankle injury towards the end of last season, hit 42 winners but also made 43 unforced errors during the victory.\nBig-hitting American Sloane Stephens relied on accuracy instead of power, winning 69 percent of points on her first serve to ease past compatriot Taylor Townsend 6-4 6-2.\nWorld number two Rafa Nadal swatted aside Australian wild card James Duckworth 6-4 6-3 7-5 in a performance that eased concerns over his fitness ahead of the season’s first major.\nThe 2009 winner had pulled out of the Brisbane International warmup with a thigh strain but showed no signs of the problem in his opener, beating Duckworth in two hours and 15 minutes.\nHe faces Matthew Ebden or Jan-Lennard Struff next.\nWimbledon runner",

        "prompt": "Job search engines are depressing. After endless browsing I feel like a restaurateur trying to find the perfect dessert - unsatisfied, unwell, and a little fatter than when I started.\nWith websites like Gumtree and Monster advertising thousands of jobs, the internet seems to offer endless possibilities, but hours of searching turn up scant results.\nI am writing as an arts graduate with a strong degree, but even with this qualification the chase can leave you despondent about the three years of study you have just completed, let alone your prospects for the future. Paid entry-level jobs for graduates are hard to come by, and those that there are often place emphasis on attributes other than your education.\nMy friend recently told me that the tipping-point of her interview at a major London auction house was not her Masters Degree in History of Art, but the fact that she was adept with a Twitter account. As David Cameron quipped, 'too many tweets might make a t***', but you could end up feeling like a t*** if you are unable to tweet.\nIn a recessive economy with a surplus of unemployed graduates it is often aspects other than education that can set you apart from the crowd, and one can be left feeling that a degree is not only superfluous but irrelevant.\nThis is especially true if you study a subject that doesn’t offer a well-defined career. I studied English and, in some respects, I am envious of my compatriots who took vocational subjects like Medicine or Law. They have the advantage of not having to spend gruelling hours, plastered to the Gumtree like a mosquito to be fossilised, trying to ‘choose’ a job.\nNot only is the path they need to follow to gain employment more obvious, but many such careers actively benefit from recession; more people fall ill in times like these, which generates business in the medical profession, and businesses tend to press their claims harder, so lawyers can make a profit.\nWhere, then, can the hapless graduate look for consolation? For one thing, it is more important now than ever before to remember that doing a degree is not just about getting a job. This, at least, is what I keep telling myself. Yet I also believe that a climate in which large numbers of graduates need to undertake a further course of study as unpaid interns to secure jobs is highly pernicious.\nI had a conversation with a judge recently who told me about a case in which an asylum seeker living in the UK had been informed that he would have to leave the country unless he earned in excess of an average of £18,000 per annum for three years.\nWhen workers earn money it is of an overall benefit to the economy; unpaid interns are not just less well-off themselves, they are also failing to contribute economically. The CIPD has been calling on firms to pay interns at least £2.50 an hour, and this writer is behind them. You might even be able to buy yourself lunch.\nYet there is a downside to insisting upon payment",
        "baseline": " for interns. Many companies would be deterred by the expenditure of running such schemes, with the result that internships themselves would become even thinner on the ground.\nSuch a loss would be significant where those internships that offer real prospects of leading to employment were concerned, but the only favourable consequence of those that don’t open any immediate doors is another entry on the CV.\nPerhaps those are the internships that would be worth eliminating, for such programmes provide a poisoned chalice, rendering graduate life an endless race to collect club-scout badges, each one leading to nothing but the next unpaid placement as you give away free labour. In an environment where we are not exactly spoiled for choice to begin with, it becomes ever more crucial to select carefully.\nSo on behalf of despondent graduates everywhere: avoid selling yourself short. At least try to ensure that, if you can’t buy lunch right now, you are working where there are sandwiches on the horizon.",

They dug holes, planted trees, and caught and released crawfish, all in an effort to learn about the environment by cleaning up the water near the Timonium school.\nThey worked - but no one seemed to notice the heat.\n\"We've been out in the sun for a while,\" 7-year-old Morgan McCanie said, \"so I'm used to it now.\"\nThe project was paid for through a Baltimore County school system program designed to promote environmental education. County students in kindergarten and first and second grades were given the opportunity to identify an environmental problem and provide a solution.\nThe program, administered by the county schools' Primary Talent Development Department, is designed to encourage children to develop critical thinking skills.\nSixty-six applications were received, but only 10 classes were awarded the $50 grants, said Debbie Myers, a Primary Talent Development resource teacher.\nWinning proposals included the creation of flowerbeds, butterfly gardens and litter cleanups, as well as addressing leaking faucets in school bathrooms. This is the first year the grant has been offered.\n\"I was praying to just get five entries, so we were so excited,\" Myers said.\nAfter this year's success, department leaders hope to expand the grant program.\nAfter asking her students to come up with ideas for the grant, Pinewood Elementary second-grade teacher Janice Delaney let the children vote on their favorite. The class got the idea for cleaning the stream and planting native trees and flowers on the bank when they went on a nature walk and realized how dirty the water was.\nWith the $50 grant, Delaney bought flowers to be planted in a small garden next to the stream, which drains into the Loch Raven Reservoir. Local businesses donated plants and mulch, and the Herring Run Watershed Association gave sycamore saplings and helped the children with the project.\n\"A lot of people feel connected to the stream after activities like this and so later in life they will do things they wouldn't normally do,\" said Darin Crew, watershed restoration manager for the association.\nThe association often works with local schools on environmental projects.\n\"It's great seeing the energy of the kids,\" he added",

Republicans seem unwilling to concede to deportation protections for those DREAMers who, under the Obama administration, self-identitified as undocumented to enroll in DACA.\nSeveral Senate Democrats who voted for a December stopgap spending measure, including Time Kaine (D-Va.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said they would not vote for the latest extension, even though some of them worry of being blamed for the shutdown as they face tough election battles this year in states that President Trump carried in 2016.\nA few Senate Republicans have also indicated they might not vote for the spending measure unless it DACA recipients.

Other polls echo these findings.\nSeveral independent think tanks have also established the strong economic benefits of protecting DREAMers from deportation. On Thursday, the non-profit American Action Forum issued a study that found that DACA recipients have a positive fiscal impact of $3.4 billion annually, and contribute roughly $42 billion to annual GDP.

Advances in web site authentication have been rare and nothing inspiring is in the offing.\nIt's official now: Only suckers pay for DV (domain validated) TLS/SSL certificates (hereinafter just 'TLS'). Symantec, the dominant player in the market, is going to give them away through a partnership program with hosting services called Encryption Everywhere.\nEven if unofficial, it has probably been obvious for a while, at least since Let's Encrypt, a free open-source certificate authority (CA) run by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), came online last September. They recently issued their millionth certificate.\nSymantec might have argued that users recognize and trust the Symantec name more than they might \"Let's Encrypt,\" but even if this is true (and I doubt it) those users are making a mistake. No matter who issues it, a DV certificate proves very little about the authenticity of the site. I think Symantec is coming to accept that people know this, to the extent that they give it any thought at all.\nTLS certificates serve two functions: To provide a public key for encrypted communications, and authentication of the site. The encryption you have always been able to do with a self-signed certificate, which you can make for yourself for free. The problem with that is that modern browsers put up 5-alarm warnings when you browse a site with a self-signed cert and make you click several times to ensure you know you're doing something stupid. It's a strange approach considering that browsers don't hassle you when you go to a site with no TLS at all.\nThis approach also presumes that a DV cert issued by a trusted CA demonstrates a meaningful level of authentication. Does it? Yes, but not to a high enough degree that ordinary users who don't scrutinize site certificates should feel safe. All it proves is that the person who obtained the certificate had access to the email account of the site's registered administrative contact. The fact that anyone can easily get a free DV cert from the respectable and democratizing Let's Encrypt, rather than from a commercial CA, just makes matters worse.\nverify the name and address of the applicant using reliable information sources, such as a government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition or a reliable third party database. The CA also confirms the authenticity of the certificate request through some means of reliable communication with the organization (i.e. they verify that the certificate requester is an authorized employee/agent within the subscribing organization). For certificates issued to individuals, the CA verifies the individual's identity using a government-issued photo ID that is inspected for indication of alteration or falsification.\nClearly there is more cost involved in vetting an OV certificate application and a human being must be involved in the process as compared to the automated process for DV certs. An EV certificate requires even more human research and greater expense.\nBut with an EV certificate at least you get the clear identification of the entity holding the certificate. See the image below. At top is an EV certificate. At bottom is a non-TLS site. In the middle is either a DV or OV site, and therein lies a big problem. There's little incentive to spend more for an OV certificate when the user experience is the same as with a free DV certificate.\nTo be sure, OV is more valuable for B2B authentication and authorization in processes which don't necessarily have a visual component like the one above. In such applications EV is probably overkill, because you are mostly paying to be able to have the green bar. OV provides a stronger authentication",
        "baseline": " than DV and is probably strong enough.\nOf course, there is also the encryption of the communications. If you're concerned about Uncle Sam listening in on your web browsing, then it's a very good thing for everyone to be using TLS. But that's not the real threat users are facing. The problem is not exposure of bits on the wire, but the inability for users to know that they're visiting the site they intended to visit and that it's a safe site.\nEven EV does only a half-assed job of this, but it may be as much as we can expect. Unfortunately, DV and OV sites are no more inherently trustworthy than sites with no certificates. The certificates are no substitute for users keeping their eyes open and being able to recognize behavior that is not normal, something we can't reasonably expect of users.\nI haven't heard of any attempts to leapfrog past this fundamental weakness of the web. We use TLS certificates for it because we have nothing better.",

        "prompt": "The first thing you see as you enter the Victoria and Albert’s newly expanded Photography Centre is a huge plate camera on a wooden tripod. It belonged to Henry Fox Talbot, the founding father of British photography. In an adjacent glass case, an array of his other cameras are on show alongside his notebooks and an original copy of his photography book, The Pencil of Nature. The centre’s inaugural exhibition is Collecting Photography: From Daguerreotype to Digital, but it is the process of photography that is the intriguing subtext.\nThere are now two main galleries, rather than one, devoted to the V&A’s photography collection, which means there is now ample room to view the prints on display in an expanded context that illuminates their production. The most visible evidence of this is the vast glass display cases that house not just cameras, but early photography books, manuals, notebooks and periodicals as well as one given over to viewing early stereoscopic images. Most of the other changes made to these repurposed Victorian picture galleries are invisible to the eye, including the complex climate control technology that protects the prints.\nAmong the highlights in the first gallery is a grid of photographs from the collection of Chauncy Hare Townshend, the 19th-century poet, clergyman and mesmerist who – alongside Prince Albert – was the only private English collector of early prints. Among them are various pictorial rural landscapes, a studio portrait of British bare knuckle boxing champion Tom Sayers and the strangely atmospheric Study of Sheep, taken in 1854, by Camille Silvy, who moved easily between the studio, the street and the countryside in search of subject matter, and who was described by his more famous contemporary Nadar as a “zélateur” or enthusiast.\nStranger still is an early portrait of a slumbering hippopotamus by the extravagantly titled Don Juan, Mario Isidro de Borbon, Count of Montizón. The setting is London Zoo, where the hippo drew huge crowds, having been captured on the banks of the White Nile and brought to London as a gift for Queen Victoria.\nLater in the gallery, a seemingly conceptual arrangement of objects – gloves, coins, nails, pieces of rope and fabric – turns out to be a bizarre still life also taken in London Zoo by Frederick William Bond. It is titled Contents of an Ostrich’s Stomach. Close to The Pencil of Nature is the first commercially produced photography book, one of Anna Atkins’s beautiful botanical studies from 1854, Festuca Ovina (Fescuie Grass). Atkins is now acknowledged as both the first female photographer and the first person to make a photography book. Her cyanotypes were created without a camera by placing specimens directly on to chemically treated paper and allowing sunlight to create a painterly silhouette effect.\nAmid the many early photographs that nod compositionally to paintings, there are some prescient moments that seem almost modernist. Frederick Holland Day’s 1905 Head of a Girl, Hampton, Virginia, is a blurred, slightly off-centre portrait of a young black girl that has a timeless quality. Likewise, the full-length self-portrait by Edward Steichen from 1933, in which he poses as if on the threshold of a doorway, which is actually a tiny blank empty picture frame on the wall behind him.\nSteichen is a definite presence here, with a glass case housing spreads from his groundbreaking journal Camera Work, published quarterly from 1903 to 1917. His striking colour portrait of socialite and Vanity Fair editor Clare Boothe Luce dates from 1938, but looks as if it could have been taken just a few years ago. An even more surprising example of early colour is an impressionistic Amsterdam street scene from 1934 by Bernard Eilers, in which blurred shop lights are reflected on a wet street in a haze of dark blues and reds. Elier’s atmospheric image anticipates the painterly style of Saul Leiter’s New York street photographs made two decades later.\nAgainst all this invention, the work in the second gallery seems almost from a different exhibition. The highlight for me is the large grid of 30 street photographs by Mark Cohen. His oddly composed, closeup images of children and teenagers on the streets of his hometown, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, gleefully disrupt the usual tropes of street photography. This is a dance of gestures and shapes: hands, feet and arms filling the frame, facial expressions and skin tones caught in warm natural colours. Cohen’s style is so singular that these images add up to an exhibition within an exhibition.\nIt was also good to come upon a characteristically gritty street tableau by the elusive Graham Smith, arguably the most gifted and certainly the least known of a generation of British documentary photographers working in the 1970s and 80s.\nOn a street in his hometown – South Bank near Middlesbrough – in 1982, Smith asked a passing couple to pose. The man balances shopping bags and boxes on a pram, while the woman holds a garish painting of Elvis Presley. The title is What She Wanted and Who She Got. This is English gritty realism writ large, by turns caustically funny and oddly melancholy.\nThere is also a recently acquired series of the late Linda McCartney’s work, the most intimate being her portraits of her family when they lived in relative seclusion on the Mull of Kintryre in the early 70s. In one, Paul in a dressing gown balances on a fence, while his son, James, jumps off a Land Rover and one of his daughters crouches in the grass. It is a study of domestic ordinariness – albeit on a 600-acre estate – at a time when the ex-Beatle was in retreat from his own myth.\nThis intriguing exhibition culminates with two special commissions that use early art works from the V&A collection as their conceptual starting points. Thomas Ruff riffs on the architectural images of the Victorian soldier-photographer Linnaeus Tripe for a series of interventions titled Tripe/Ruff. (Wouldn’t Ruff/Tri",
        "baseline": "pe be a more phonetically satisfying title?) Ruff has digitally manipulated Tripe’s negatives and then blown up the prints so they become even more detailed. The results are fascinating in a cerebral way – especially Tripe’s painted-on clouds.\nPenelope Umbrico’s inordinately slow-moving video piece, 171 Clouds from the V&A online collection, inaugurates the newly constructed Light Wall. Umbrico has extracted details of clouds from the V&A’s archive of paintings, digitally stitching them together to make a vertical “art sky”.\nHow much you appreciate both pieces will depend on your tolerance for art about art, and it might be better to approach Umbrico’s piece, in particular, on a separate visit. That aside, there is more than enough richly inventive work in the two main galleries to sustain several hours of slow looking.\nV&A Photography Centre opens on 12 October.",

        "prompt": "One of the worst parts of traveling is the luggage part. Airlines have almost made it a sin (for which we must be punished) to have even one bag bigger than a wallet. The airlines do not care if we are going to be away from home for one hour or one year, baggage is evil and must be stowed away (for a fee), hidden as soon as we enter the cabin (with limited space), almost impossible to access during flight, and bounced and dropped by handlers as we wait (ever more anxiously) for our precious stuff to show up on the carousel after a flight. When did luggage become immoral and wicked?\nMany pieces of luggage are lost when passengers change planes. In 2016, 47 percent of all cases of delayed bags occurred between connecting flights, especially those with small time frames. Misplaced baggage is more than annoying to passengers, it is expensive to the airlines as recovering and returning lost bags costs the aviation industry $2.1 billion (2016).\nThe hope for the future is based on RFID tracking – making Resolution 753 an industry-wide reality. The SITA Baggage Report estimates the cost of implementing RFID at $0.10 per passenger, generating a savings of $0.20 per passenger. RFID could save the industry more than $3 billion over the next 7 years by improving baggage management and operations, and, of course, improve the quality of life for the passengers.\nIt is reassuring to note that our dearly loved bags may soon have a better chance of joining us as we travel, however, we are still faced with a problem: what to do with the luggage between the time we check out of a hotel or a B&B and arrive at the airport (or train/bus station).\nIn the “old days” the hotel concierge would stow the bags for a minimal charge (or tip), allowing guests the freedom to explore for the day, return for their precious cargo, and head to the station. Today, many hotels have ceased this service under the guise of liability.\nThere was a time hotel management permitted late check-outs (up to 4 PM) to accommodate guests with late transportation departures. Currently, unless you have a special credit card, or received dispensation from a manager, the opportunities to linger in your room and stay close to your luggage, are non-existent…you are expected to have vacated your room by 1 PM (the latest).\nEven if the hotel permits you to leave your bags to explore, it is likely that the accommodations are located in remote areas – not even close to the nearby city, park, mountain, mall – you want to investigate.\nSo, the question remains: what to do with luggage in that time/space continuum between the hotel check-out and the transportation check-in.\nWhat to do? Your flight does not leave for many hours, the airline will not permit early check-in and even if you wanted to hang out at the airport, airlines may not permit early check-ins.\nAn overnight success story (that has taken two years to fund), started when two enterprising millennials had their own dismal experience (schlepping 3 large pieces of luggage around Los Angeles). They knew that there must be a way to get rid of the luggage for a few hours, at a minimal expense, that would also sight-seeing without being tethered to their bags.\nWithout a clue on how to keep the sightseeing and delete the luggage Khattri and Kesarwani discarded idea after idea until they came up with Vertoe – the place to drop your luggage while sightseeing, attending business meetings, or catching up with friends and family, at a nominal charge, that was convenient, safe and doable.\nWith 100+ locations include New York City, Boston, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia, Vertoe offers a convenient and safe way to store your stuff at local neighborhood shops, in the areas you want to visit. The partner shops are manually verified for safety and customers receive a free unique coded tampe- proof seal when the items are placed at the location. To make customers feel even more secure, $3000 in insurance is provided for stowed items. Luggage space is reserved online, the public space address is sent and the daily fee is paid via a credit card.\nThe allocated space for your bag (or bags) will be inside local shops who have extra space. Each location is verified as trustworthy and the staff of the store/shop/gym is trained by the Vertoe staff before becoming authorized to accept bags.\nVertoe will store your bag with pricing that starts at $5.95 per day/item (with a few variations based on location). Want to store your luggage for a longer period of time? Weekly and monthly discounts are available. Want to cancel your reservation?

        "prompt": "Paul Buijs has had a lot of jobs over his lifetime but his new one might be among the shortest. He was a Marine, a Florida cop and an NYC-based U.S. air marshal. During that period, the most dangerous thing he saw wasn’t on a plane but on the subway to the airport: a drugged-out straphanger threatening a woman in the wee hours of the morning. He’s been a fitness studio manager and is starting a fitness events website, but in the meantime he’s also organizing a not-exactly-sanctioned Citi Bike race.\nThe race (which is being branded as “NOT A RACE,” just in case) is being held 9 a.m. Saturday. The winner is the rider who shows the quickest time from somewhere north of 100th Street to somewhere south of Houston on the iron horses, measured by the Citi Bike app. Choose your own route. The male and female winners each get prizes, including some fitness classes and 100,000 New York Coins, a local crypto currency. May the best bike-share warrior win.\n“I hope I don’t get sued,” says Buijs, 40. To protect himself, the full $30 entry fee goes straight to charity, and the only thing Buijs gets is a bit of buzz for his new website. He says the race is a one-time deal.\nBut there’s something entertaining about the thought of a Citi Bike race flashing downtown. It’s taking an amateur’s tool to a realm of highly specialized gear. It advances an “anyone can do it” ethos in the biking world. You can’t take yourself too seriously if you’re hustling on a Citi Bike, but it does the job.\nWithout much publicity, Buijs has just under 40 people signed up for his regular-person unofficial not-a-race. He’s gunning for 200.\nSo, for a few weeks, his new pseudo-job is bike-race promoter. On a recent publicity push, Buijs took an afternoon to distribute flyers, including at Chrome Industries, a gear shop on Mulberry Street that is much more on the serious side of biking. There he met Francisco Colón, 35, a store manager and racer.\nIf Buijs is your everyman roadster, Colón is a real cyclist. Buijs has ridden in a few casual races and has great stamina. Colón raced in the Red Hook Crit, a wild and crash-prone event that took place in April on a wet course in Brooklyn. Buijs sold his road bike for rent after quitting the air marshall job and now exclusively uses Citi Bike (he’s 750 miles in). Colón has some five bikes, but generously offers that he likes Citi Biking and has done it on occasion when trying to go somewhere, particularly when it’s raining. “The bike itself is rad,” he says.\nColón gamely questions Buijs about some of the race mechanics. Could you have the bike undocked and get a running start?\n“There’s always a way to cheat the system,” says Colón, grinning devilishly.\nColón thinks out loud about the fastest route. Buijs guesses the West Side Highway. Colón says that for real street racers, a straight shot through traffic would be quicker. That kind of bravado riding is par for the course in so",
        "baseline": "-called “alleycats,” where bike messengers and other daredevil riders compete in unsanctioned street races.\nHaving sold the idea of his race at the shop, Buijs moved on to a new constituency of potential racers: people in attendance at a happy hour for cryptocurrency New York Coin, one of the race partners. There, he turned down chilled rosé and instead handed out flyers, pitching the race and admiring a thematic art exhibit on the wall. The objects were meditations on old NY subway tokens, a pre-Citi Bike means of travel.\nThe artist, in attendance, explained that he accepted crypto for his work but hadn’t yet made a sale that way. It’s tough to hustle up a good idea from scratch, as the artist and Buijs and alleycat route planners and Citi Bike users know well. Still, everyone in New York has to be open to new opportunities.",

She had 26 points, 24 rebounds and two blocks – one of which was an earth-shattering rejection that sent waves throughout The Hump and a message to the visiting Gamecocks.\nThe context of Staley’s comment could come as a surprise, though. Staley wasn’t angry about her team’s inability to stop McCowan on either end of the court. She even said she can live with the type of numbers McCowan had.\nShe can’t live with what Mississippi State’s other key contributors did.\nSenior guard Jordan Danberry averages 13.4 points per game. She had 20 against South Carolina. Sophomore guard Bre’Amber Scott averages 6.4 points per game. She had 11 against the Gamecocks.\nEven senior point guard Jazzmun Holmes, who is looking to be more of a playmaker than a scorer on any given night, chimed in with 12 points against a South Carolina team that prides itself on defense.\nMississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer doesn’t like to go deep into his bench, especially in games as important as Thursday night’s. So when sophomore forward Chloe Bibby went down with a season-ending knee injury in the game’s first minute, he needed heightened production from other players.\nWith the exception of an off-night from Anriel Howard, the team’s second-leading scorer, he got what he needed. Howard had a rough shooting night as she went 3-of-13 from the field and only had 11 points. She also got into foul trouble, which negatively affected her performance even further.\nIn addition to Danberry and Holmes’ above-average games, Scott truly made the difference for State. Bibby averages 27.6 minutes per game, second-most on the team behind Holmes. Scott gave Schaefer 27 minutes in a game Schaefer said was as big as any regular season game could be.\n\"When you get in that moment tonight, you’ve got to play,\" Schaefer said. \"You’ve got to function. Truly, there aren’t many bigger stages than what we had tonight in that game.\"\nThe rest of Schaefer’s bench – freshman point guard Myah Taylor, freshman center Jessika Carter and sophomore guard Andra Espinoza-Hunter – only played 29 minutes combined. Staley was impressed by Scott’s ability to replace",
        "baseline": " Bibby.\nNeeding Scott to step up on a nightly basis could be Mississippi State’s new reality. It’s one thing to replicate Bibby’s production in one game. It’s another to keep it up throughout the rest of the season.\nScott shouldn’t be relied upon to shoulder all the pressure. Espinoza-Hunter played 15 minutes against South Carolina, which is the most she’s played in any conference game this season. Her role could greatly increase in the wake of Bibby’s exit from the lineup.\nSchaefer said he’s had to be “careful” in trying to build confidence in players like Scott and Espinoza-Hunter. They are both only sophomores, and Schaefer doesn’t like to throw young players into the fire. Now he might have to. With what they accomplished against South Carolina, he feels more comfortable in doing so.",

And the outlook in coming years, as climate change continues, is foreboding.\nThe state's fire season now stretches later into the fall and starts earlier in the spring.\nDriving the news: Longer-term climate change and population growth are combining to increase wildfire risk in California and more broadly across the American West.\nOne of the starkest changes firefighters are contending with is an uptick in instances of extreme fire behavior, such as the massive EF-3 fire tornado that accompanied the Carr Fire in July.\nThe biggest climate change-related impact is manifested in the increased dryness of vegetation.\n“The warming equals drying equals more explosive fire growth,\" said Neil Lareau, a researcher specializing in fire weather at the University of Nevada at Reno.\nAccording to a major climate assessment published in 2017, climate change-related factors helped to double the forest fire area burned in the West between 1984 and 2015.\nOther studies have pointed to the role",

But simply stopping building in such regions is not necessarily a practical solution.\"Almost everywhere we live in the West is wildland-urban interface,\" said Lareau. \"It's overly simple to say we shouldn't be building here.\"\nThe bottom line: The recent, deadly fires are the new normal in California, and residents of other Western states should be paying close attention, because they could be next.",

        "prompt": "When the mosquitoes bite, they transfer the malarial parasites into the person's bloodstream, causing them to become ill.\nOnly the female mosquito feeds on human blood, however.\nIn exceptionally rare circumstances the disease can also be spread by blood transfusions.\nA recent study found that children who have malaria smell ‘sweeter’ to mosquitoes.\nPublished in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, UK researchers attached electrodes to mosquitoes’ antennae.\nThey examined their reaction to 117 foot odour samples of children, and found the insects were most attracted to children who had already contracted malaria.\nWhere are you at risk of contracting malaria?\nMalaria is a massive issue for a huge section of the world's population.\nIn these countries it is important to take extra care to avoid mosquitoes, or take anti-malarial medication to prevent infection.\nWhat are the symptoms of malaria?\nMalaria has a host of unpleasant symptoms which also can be brought on by a variety of other issues sometimes causing confusion for doctors.\nSymptoms typically take between ten days to four weeks to emerge and can in some cases lie dormant for several months.\nAfter the early stage symptoms, the condition can become rapidly life-threatening especially if the person infected is pregnant, elderly or very young and is not treated immediately.\nWithin just hours, the red blood cells cannot carry enough oxygen to the major organs, leaving a person weak and faint.\nIt can also cause cerebral malaria, where the brain swells, which in turn leads to brain damage and seizures.\nThe kidneys and liver can also being to fail and a fluid can build up on the lungs meaning it is difficult to breathe.\nAnd if any of these complications crop up and they are not treated immediately, they can be fatal.\nThis can all happening in a matter of just hours - depending upon the health of the person infected.\nWhat is the treatment for malaria?\nMalaria is treated with drugs known as anti-malarials and vary depending on the type and severity of the disease.\nIf quickly diagnosed and properly treated people with malaria can usually expect to make a full recovery.\nBut the severe form of the disease can progress at a terrifying speed and can kill a person within hours or days.\nThough most people if they over come the disease beat it for good some can experience recurring symptoms at irregular intervals through their life.\nIn some areas of the world however those repeatedly infected with the disease have developed a level of immunity.\nExperts have worked for years to try and minimise the spread of the disease.\nThere is no vaccine for malaria so currently the only way to eradicate it would be to wipe mosquitoes from the planet.\nHowever this would be an exceptionally expensive process and so far the best defence against the disease is still sleeping under a mosquito net.\nAs most mosquitoes bite at night, sleeping under one of the nets keeps the insects at bay, limiting the chance of being targeted by them.\nThe nets are relatively inexpensive but in some countries are still hard to come by.\nThere are also ways you can ward off being bitten by taking simple steps such as staying indoors or in areas with air conditioning, where it is cool and dry and wearing loose, baggy clothing.\nDEET insect repellent can also be used and applied to exposed skin as a way of warding off mosquitoes.\nThere aren't any medications that can completely eradicate the chances of getting the disease but anti-malarials can reduce the risk of infection by up to 90 per cent.\nYour GP can provide you with the drugs if you are going to an infected country and assess whether you are suitable for them.\nThe anti-malarials have to be taken before you travel to your destination and in some cases for up to four weeks after you return.\nWhich celebrities have contracted malaria?\nSeveral celebrities have spoken out and revealed that they have battled malaria.\nIn 2010, singer Cheryl ended up fighting for her life after contracting the disease",

        "prompt": "Memphis's love of blues and gospel, rockabilly and soul is worn like a heart on a sleeve. Al Green, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley smile down from restaurant wall posters, while hotels sport saxophone sculptures and staircases shaped like a piano keyboard.\nMusic spills nonstop from juke joints, jazz halls and blues clubs. Never mind the smattering of cheesy souvenir shops, tattoo parlors and psychic-reading emporiums; Beale Street's sultry call is irresistible.\nThis summer the city will celebrate with ''50 Years of Rock 'n' Roll.'' The festivities will reach a peak on July 5, the anniversary of the day in 1954 when Elvis Presley, who was 19, walked into Sun Studio, crooned ''That's All Right'' into the microphone and won over Sam Phillips, the skeptical owner of the studio, with his rendition of the old blues song. It was, of course, an overnight sensation, even if the exact birth date of rock 'n' roll is open to debate.\nSince then, Memphis has spawned dozens of singers, from Otis Redding and Tina Turner to Jerry Lee Lewis and Justin Timberlake. Isaac Hayes and Sam the Sham will be among those on hand to celebrate.\nOn Sept. 10, Memphis will open the $250 million FedEx Forum, right behind Beale Street downtown, which, at the request of the resident Memphis Grizzlies basketball team, plays up the city's music theme. The Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum will move there from its present location across the street, with a new gallery tracing the influence of its two title genres on the way Americans live.\nA full year of 50th anniversary parties hits a high note at 11 a.m., Memphis time, on July 5 when radio stations around the world are expected to play ''That's All Right.'' Scotty Moore, Elvis's guitarist, will play the record from the Sun Studio control room. For details, contact the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau, 47 Union Avenue, (800) 873-6282, www.memphistravel.com or www.50yearsrocknroll.com.\nThere will be a daylong block party with music, all in front of Sun Studio. Among the evening's headliners are D.J. Fontana (a Presley guitarist and drummer) and Smoochie Smith, a rockabilly pianist who scored a hit, ''Last Night,'' with the Mar-Keys in 1961.\nDuring Elvis Week 2004, Aug. 7 to 16, dozens of events, from scavenger hunts, picnics and walking tours to film festivals and sock hops, will celebrate the entertainer's life, ending with a candlelight vigil at Graceland on the 17th anniversary of his death. Information: (800) 238-2000, www.elvis.com. Many events take place at Graceland, at 3734 Elvis Presley Boulevard. Ticket prices vary, and some events are free.\nThrough Sept. 12, ''The Beatles! Backstage and Behind the Scenes'' is on view at the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, 926 East McLemore Avenue, (901) 942-7685, www.soulsvilleusa.com. The show, a photography exhibition from the archives of the CBS and Life magazine photographer Bill Eppridge, includes 84 never-published images of the Beatles on their 1964 American tour. Stax Records produced over 50 soul hits, including ''Sitting on the Dock of the Bay'' and ''Soul Man.'' The museum's permanent exhibit features items like Otis Redding's favorite leather jacket and Isaac Hayes's 1972 peacock-blue Eldorado Cadillac, with 24-karat-gold trim and white sheep skin carpet. Admission, $9.\nEven during this rock-crazed year, music isn't the city's only creative outlet. Positioned on a gently sloping knoll in Overton Park is the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, 1934 Poplar Avenue, (901) 544-6200, www.brooksmuseum.org. From June 20 to Aug. 15, the Brooks will present ''Picasso: 25 Years of Edition Ceramics,'' an exhibition of 65 objects depicting mythological characters and scenes painted by the artist, from the collection of Edward and Ann Weston. Closed Monday; $6.\nThe Pyramid, an entertainment and sports center at 1 Auction Avenue, (800) 263-6744, www.wonders.org, is the only North American stop for ''Masters of Florence: Glory and Genius at the Court of the Medici.'' Through Oct. 3, it tells the story of Italian ingenuity from 1300 to 1740 and showcases nearly 250 objects -- including sculpture, paintings and jewelry -- by Leonardo, Michelangelo and others. Open daily; $15.\nSun Studio, 706 Union Avenue, (800) 441-6249, www.sunstudio.com, where B.B. King, Rufus Thomas, Carl Perkins and a traveling appliance salesman named Johnny Cash got their start, is still a working studio. More recently, Bonnie Raitt, the Stray Cats and U2 are among the musicians to record in this ordinary-looking space. During tours, conducted hourly on the half hour, visitors can touch the original microphone and straddle the masking-tape X where Elvis stood to record his first song. Admission, $9.50.\nRows of red, gold and electric-blue guitars incubate behind glass walls after being glued, painted and lacquered by hand at the Gibson Guitar Factory, 145 Lt. George W. Lee Avenue, (901) 543-0800, www.gibsonshowcase.com/bealestreet/thefactory.html. Guided-tour participants get a glimpse of the process and learn about popular artists who play Gibson guitars.

Memorabilia includes the original typed lyrics to ''Heartbreak Hotel'' and more than 30 costumes worn by Jerry Lee Lewis, Al Green and others. General admission, $8.50.\nThe Beale Street Entertainment District pulsates 24 hours a day. Bands perform in clubs, on the sidewalk and in W.C. Handy Park while tourists chow down on oysters, gumbo and ribs at outdoor restaurant tables. Thanks to a rebirth that began in the 1980's, this family-friendly strip has come a long way since its 1920's heyday of brothels, gambling joints and voodoo. Information: (901) 526-0110, bealestreet.com.\nThe ''Exploring the Legacy'' wing of the National Civil Rights Museum, 450 Mulberry Street, (901) 521-9699, www.civilrightsmuseum.org, follows the civil rights movement after the Rev.

At least not in the view of Kevin Starr, a partner at Third Rock Ventures, which helped found Agios in 2008, providing part of its $33 million Series A funding. In April 2010, Summit, NJ-based Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) poured its first $130 million into Agios, and on Oct. 5, it extended the deal to four years from three, for another $20 million. “From a size standpoint, this is the largest partnership we have among any of our portfolio companies by a wide margin,” Starr says.\nAgios and Celgene are working on a new class of drugs designed to starve cancer cells of key enzymes. Celgene had the option to extend the deal under the original agreement, but virtually no one expected the company to exercise that right so soon. Although Agios has identified several lead clinical candidates, it could be as long as two years before any of them are ready for human trials, says Agios CEO David Schenkein. “What’s most important to us is not the dollars” involved in the Celgene deal, Schenkein says, “but the statement Celgene is making. It shows they’re confident in Agios as a partner.” Celgene has the right to extend the deal again, as well as an exclusive option to license any of the drugs for an undisclosed period of time.\nCancer metabolism is the study of enzymes that alter the metabolism of cancer cells by feeding them nutrients they need to grow. Depriving tumors of such mutated enzymes could be an efficient method for starving the cancer to death. The field is so promising that drug giants ranging from",

Thomas Daniel, Celgene’s president of research, believes Agios is emerging as a clear leader. “The earlier-than-planned trigger on the investment shows our enthusiasm for Agios, the collaboration, and the progress being made,” he says.\nThe story behind the Agios-Celgene alliance could serve as a blueprint for other biotech startups that want to gain an early foothold—both scientific and financial—in a hot emerging field. Starr, who served as the company’s founding CEO, describes the company’s first nine or so months as a carefully calculated effort of integrating diverse scientific disciplines, translating a broad idea into solid intellectual property, and ultimately finding a partner with deep pockets and a common vision.",

Unable to find a place in Murfreesboro that sold macarons, Edwards decided to try her hand at the cookies and, after reading a few recipes and watching a YouTube tutorial, she successfully made her first batch.\nAfter she posted pictures of the cookies on Instagram and Facebook, family and friends started messaging her and asking whether they could buy them. Within a few days of those initial requests, Olive Branch Bakery was born.\nWhile the primary focus is macarons, cakes, and assorted sandwich cookies, Edwards is planning on expanding the menu to include a variety of loaded brownies and mini cheesecakes soon.

        "prompt": "America's legal world needs to rethink what it considers people's private information so it can get a grip on today's spying techniques.\nStemming from 1970s telephone laws, communications metadata – which details who you talk to, when and where etc – is considered by the courts to be separate from the actual contents of your communications. Fewer legal hoops need to be jumped through to obtain citizens' metadata: it's considered basic information.\nYet, on today's internet, those metadata records reveal plenty of personal information – potentially more useful information than the actual calls and chats they describe.\nAs such, the line between metadata and private communications is completely blurred by today's technology. US laws fail to recognize this, granting the cops and Feds easy access to sensitive metadata and allowing them run roughshod over Americans' privacy.\nOur final conclusion is simple. The Internet is far more complex than the phone network was in 1979. Electronic surveillance laws and policies must accommodate this complexity.\nIn the paper, the authors point out that concepts such as non-content distinctions (what exactly is metadata, for example) were designed for pre-internet mediums such as phone calls, and cannot translate to internet services.\nThe concept of metadata as a category of information that is entirely distinguishable from communications",
        "baseline": " content and thus deserving of lower privacy protection is no longer tenable.\nThe paper's authors also note that the concept of \"third-party doctrine\" as it stands makes little sense on the internet. When you share information about yourself to a third party, it is no longer considered protected: you gave it away. Today's online services run through so many third parties without a user's explicit consent, there's almost always a third party involved, thus weakening one's privacy protections.\nCo-author Matt Blaze told The Register that fixing the problem wouldn't be as simple passing one law or setting a single precedent in court.\n\"We don't think there's an single fix, and it probably needs to be addressed at every level from individual cases to comprehensive 'clean slate' legislation,\" Blaze said.\n\"What is clear is that rules so deeply rooted in the technology of the 20th century phone system are going to yield increasingly unsatisfying results and become less and less useful going forward.\"",

Eric Greitens shared details of his new tax proposal on Monday, Jan. 29 during a visit to Palmyra, discussing a new plan that would result in tax cuts for 97 percent of Missouri taxpayers if approved.\nGreitens spoke with scores of people gathered at Doyle Manufacturing, outlining how his tax plan was focused on helping working Missourians and driving business growth. Greitens stressed that the tax cuts would continue to increase jobs and revenue. With unemployment rates at their lowest level in 17 years for the Show Me State, Greitens said more prosperity was on the way through the new plan.\n“We're going to be bringing more jobs and higher pay to the people of Missouri,” he said.\nIf approved, Greitens' tax plan would cut back certain regulations and loopholes — like bonuses to corporations for filing taxes on time and incentivizing companies to hire out-of-state employees — and would reduce corporate income tax rates from 6.25 percent to 4.25 percent. That tax rate would be the second-lowest level in the nation. The plan also called for a revamp to a decades-old law Greitens said would remove the tax burden for 380,000 working-class Americans.\nGreitens said Missouri taxpayers who earned more than $9,072 each year were classified under the top income tax rate based on an existing 1971 law. The tax cut proposal would cut the tax rate for those residents from 5.9 percent to 5.3 percent. Greitens also touted a “Workers First” tax cut, which would enact a 20-percent non-refundable credit against tax liability based on the existing federal earned income tax credit system.\nGreitens said the",

He said Department of Revenue staff studied 7,000 different scenarios, reinforcing Greitens' statements that 97 percent of Missourians would receive a tax cut and 380,000 working-class families would not pay anything on their tax bill.\n“If we do this together — if we stand up together and say we're going to fight for a system that rewards working families and rewards businesses for hiring people, and building here in the state of Missouri... — we're going to take this state in a new and better direction,” he said. Jeff Bettitt, Electrician and Supervisor of the Electrical Department at Doyle Manufacturing, agreed that Greitens' plan would provide far-reaching benefits for Missourians.\nBettitt said that aspects like the corporate income tax break would lead to improved working conditions and the ability to upgrade facilities more often — which he said would benefit people throughout the region.",

I see the struggles, I see the strife they're running away from,\" he said.\nJenkins said the humanitarian thing to do is to send back thousands of undocumented immigrant children to their home countries. \"The most fair, uncruel way to deal with this issue is to return these kids to their families,\" Jenkins said.\nJenkins has come under fire over who paid for his trip: A D.C.-based group called Federation for American Immigration Reform. The organization has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, for its leaders' past racist remarks, anti-immigrant activities and links to white supremacy and eugenics.\nJenkins dismissed those concerns. \"The fact they funded the trip has nothing to do with our mission,\" Jenkins said. \"There was no agenda",
        "baseline": ". We weren't told what to see, what to think, what to bring back.\"\nBut Karl Bickel, Jenkins' opponent in the upcoming election, called the decision to spend several days on the border was an inappropriate one.\n\"I don't think it was a responsible thing to do,\" said Bickel, the Democratic nominee for Frederick County sheriff, noting the challenges law enforcement faces here at home — including a growing heroin problem. \"I don't think there was anything to be gained that is going to be useful here in Frederick County.\"\nA recent poll from the Frederick News-Post found that most respondents agreed, with more than 55 percent of them saying they thought Jenkins' trip was a waste of time.\nJenkins admitted that the flood of children across the border does pose a serious crisis.\n\"It's a tremendous challenge,\" he said. \"My fear is that they can't do it without a full military deployment, without changes in law and policy.\"",

Surely he would succeed where Abbott had failed. Yet here we are.\nAnd what mischief Abbott and his band of misfit supporters have been up to. There was to be no wrecking, no sniping, and no undermining. Call that another Abbott broken promise.\nAnd call it something else Turnbull could — should — have foreseen, but didn’t.\nThe latest insurgent gambit involves the same band of no-hopers — the AAAs who hate Turnbull: Abbott, (Kevin) Andrews and (Peter) Abetz.\nThey are “conservatives” who think the Government building a $4 billion coal-fired power station in the privatised Eastern States electricity market is the way to win an election.\n“I’m not greatly attracted to that,” John Howard told 7.30’s Leigh Sales when asked if a new coal power station was a sound investment for government.\nRemarkably, it is still Howard, a decade after his ouster, who appears the most persuasive advocate and guiding light for his side.\n“The one observation I would make, and it’s an observation for the benefit of all members of the Liberal Party, is that they carry a heavy responsibility,” Howard said.\nStated plainly with the clarity of a thunderbolt. This is where Turnbull’s coalition, consumed by sideshows of personality and ambition, derailed by self-inflicted circumstance and poor judgment, have failed.\nSo, is the country is in love with Bill Shorten? It�",

Kevin Rudd convinced Australians he was just a younger, friendlier Howard; Julia Gillard sued for peace with mining companies.\nBy contrast, Shorten is generationally hostile to private enterprise, vowing to rip up company tax cuts if they pass the Senate. And he’s broadly got away with the claim that his proposed changes to dividend imputation rules are the closing of a tax “loophole” that benefits the ultra rich.\nPrivate health insurance is also in his sights, and he opposes every savings measure for rising health, education and welfare budgets. Not only that, he advocates even more spending on these areas without ever explaining how they should be paid for.\nIs this really what Australian voters are ready and willing to sign up for? The Government must heed Howard and unify.",

On the morning of Feb. 18, 2015, he went to get coffee at a Laredo McDonald’s before heading to work at his one-man car wash, as he had done for years.\n“He was sitting at the McDonald’s by himself — drinking his coffee — when he received a phone call on his cell phone. The caller-ID on his cellular phone showed the call coming from a ‘Restricted Number,'” the complaint states.\nThe caller identified himself as a police officer and said he had some questions for Gonzalez, who agreed to meet him at the McDonald’s.\n“Mere minutes later, Mr. Gonzalez-Flores noticed approximately 30 armed men — some in camouflaged uniforms, others in civilian clothing with badges hanging on their necks, others with military style goggles and helmets, carrying military-style rifles — running around outside the McDonald’s,” the lawsuit states.\nScared and confused, Gonzalez says, he walked outside with his coffee and saw more armed men in unmarked black SUVs and they asked him to identify himself, which he did.\nRana is Spanish for frog.\nThe DEA agents and Laredo police were executing a warrant on a federal grand jury indictment, accusing Gonzales-Flores of involvement in a Los Zetas cartel ring that smuggled tons of marijuana from Mexico into Laredo, shipped it to Dallas, sold it there and sent the money back across the border.\nThe Zetas are an offshoot of Mexican security forces, many of whom received U.S. training. Their founding members worked for the Gulf Cartel but split off and formed their own cartel in early 2010.\nGonzalez says the agents arrested him and asked if he wanted to leave his pickup at the McDonald’s or take it to his car wash. On the drive to the car wash, he says, the agents interrogated him without reading him his Miranda rights.\nOne officer asked him: “Where did you disappear to all this time? Where have you been all this time, Rana?” Gonzalez’s attorney wrote in the 33-page complaint.\nGonzalez says the agents ignored him when he said he had been living a simple life for eight years, leaving his modest Laredo home each morning, stopping by McDonald’s for coffee, going to his car wash, “where day-in and day-out he would wash cars in the scorching Laredo heat — shirtless and in plain view of any passerby” and going to a local bank two or three times a week to deposit cash from his car wash.\nGonzalez was taken before a U.S. magistrate judge who declined to set a bond for him, or appoint him an attorney.\nHis wife had to borrow $10,000 to pay for his defense and he spent 36 days in federal custody — five days in Webb County jail and the rest in a prison outside Laredo owned by the GEO Group, a private prison company. After he spent five weeks and a day in jail, the government filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.\n“No explanation was provided by the prosecutors of the United States Attorney’s Office as to why the indictment was being dismissed against Mr. Felipe Gonzalez-Flores,” the complaint states.\nDespite his release from custody, and his innocence, Gonzalez says, the damage to his reputation lingers on the Internet and in public records.\nIn January this year, nearly a year after his arrest, a PACER search of federal court records brought up his name as a defendant in the case.\nA Google search of “Felipe Gonzalez-Flores Laredo”",
        "baseline": " brought up five stories, the first a Department of Justice press release, all saying he was arrested with 16 others for their alleged roles in the conspiracy.\n“Due to this miscarriage of justice, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez-Flores seeks $2,000 for each day he spent in custody, a sum of $72,000,” the lawsuit states.\nHe also wants the government to pay him his $10,000 in attorney’s fees, $5,000 for future attorney’s fees he’ll need to expunge his record, and $100,000 for “pain and suffering, emotional distress, and mental anguish” for a total of $187,000.\nHis legal claims are negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Bivens claims, malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.\nHe is represented by Norberto Cardenas in Laredo.\nA DEA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.",

Here are some key passages from the executive summary.\n\"In the Inquiry’s view, the diplomatic options had not at that stage [March 2003] been exhausted. Military action was therefore not a last resort.\"\n\" Mr Blair’s long Note of 28 July, telling President Bush “I will be with you, whatever,” was seen, before it was sent, only by No. 10 officials ... While the Note was marked “Personal” (to signal that it should have a restricted circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK Government’s position by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States. The Foreign and Defence Secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to comment on the draft in advance. \"\n\"The circumstances in which it was ultimately decided that there was a legal basis for UK participation were far from satisfactory.\"\n\"When he saw the draft paper on WMD countries of concern on 8 March, Mr Straw commented: “Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has to show why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq. It does not quite do this yet.”\"\n\"The lack of evidence to support pre‑conflict claims about Iraq’s WMD challenged the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community, and the legitimacy of the war.\"\n\"Concern that vital areas of co-operation between the UK and the US could be damaged if the UK did not give the US its full support over Iraq; the belief that the best way to influence US policy towards the direction preferred by the UK was to commit full and unqualified support, and seek to persuade from the inside.\"\n\"The declared objectives of the UK and the US towards Iraq up to the time of the invasion differed. The US was explicitly seeking to achieve a change of regime; the UK to achieve the disarmament of Iraq, as required by UN Security Council resolutions.\"\n\"Mr Blair had been advised that an invasion of Iraq was expected to increase the threat to the UK and UK interests from Al Qaida and its affiliates.\"\n\"UK planning and preparation for the post‑conflict phase of operations, which rested on the assumption that the UK would be able quickly to reduce its military presence in Iraq and deploy only a minimal number of civilians, were wholly inadequate. \"\n\"The",

There was no “credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD‑related technology and expertise to terrorist groups”. It was possible that Iraq might use WMD in terrorist attacks, but only if the regime was under serious and imminent threat of collapse.\"\n\"… After the invasion, the UK Government, including the intelligence community, was reluctant to admit, and to recognise publicly, the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UK’s pre‑conflict collection, validation, analysis and presentation of intelligence on Iraq’s WMD.\"",

It passed following an 8-2 vote.\nEarlier, state Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, said that in addition to adding language that specifically criticizes amnesty, the text of the original resolution was also changed to favor a path to “earned legal status” and not citizenship.\nIn order to be considered by the full House, the measure must appear on the House calendar by Tuesday.\nHoping to win conservative support, legislators have added stronger opposition to amnesty to a resolution urging Congress to reform immigration laws. House Concurrent Resolution 44, by state Reps. Ana Hernandez Luna, D-Houston, and Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, was initially drafted in February but finally got a hearing from the House State Affairs Committee late Wednesday.\n“I feel that we are at a point where immigration reform is imminent and Texas should be speaking with a strong voice on this issue,” Anchia said. “Texas has as much to gain with comprehensive immigration reform as it has to lose” without it.\nInitially, the nonbinding resolution included key talking points from Republican groups that urged reform, including the Cato Institute and the Partnership for a New American Economy. Language citing a 2006 study by the state comptroller, which showed that deporting millions of Texans in the state illegally would have resulted in a loss to the state’s gross domestic product of $18 billion, was also included, as were statements of support for immigration reform from former state Reps. John Garza, R-San Antonio, and Raul Torres, R-Corpus Christi. Those are still in the measure, but Anchia said it was necessary to change some of the language due to what he said was conservative opposition to anything hinting at amnesty.\n“Nobody in this House supports outright amnesty but rather an earned legal status,” Anchia said. The",
        "baseline": " committee substitute that went before the committee included additional language that admonished the most recent reform proposals for not preventing future illegal migration.\n“Solutions that provide for blanket amnesty, such as those presented in the Simpson-Mazzoli Act of 1986, encourage future violations of the law and should be excluded from the panoply of options to be considered by the United States Congress,” the resolution now states.\nThe language was included with help from state Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, who worked with Anchia to draft a resolution more palatable to House Republicans.\nBill Hammond, the president of the Texas Association of Business, said supporting the reform effort was timely, and would also address one of the key concerns many stakeholders have.\nThe committee didn't vote on the resolution. Chairman Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, expressed his appreciation for Anchia and Hernandez’s efforts, but also expressed doubts about Congress’ ability to act.",

        "prompt": "If you have clients who own companies with pre-tax profit of $1 million or more, it’s likely those business could be sold to a third party.\nSome entrepreneurs pride themselves on the fact their companies can’t run without them. They keep the major customer contacts and supplier relationships to themselves. Operational logistics and other key aspects of the business aren’t documented. As a result, the primary source of the firm’s success walks out the door as soon as the deal closes. Having a management team capable of continuing the business uninterrupted will improve sale prospects.\nDue diligence can uncover shortcomings in a company’s recordkeeping. These might include out-of-date customer contracts and regulatory reporting, vague and incomplete marketing or production information, and inaccurate inventory tracking. Without thorough and accurate records, purchasers won’t know what they’re buying and will be reluctant to close the deal.\nSome people put a positive spin on information at the expense of accuracy. The first time a buyer discovers something factually incorrect, suspicions start. If more inaccuracies are revealed, things get worse. Even if the exaggerations don’t add up to much, many buyers will walk away for fear there is a larger surprise hidden in the shadows.\nConfront a strategic weakness head on. For example, you may not have an HR manager, but realize you have a bunch of personnel headaches you have yet to deal with. While you may not be able to correct the issue before the sale, letting the prospective owner know the problem in advance can turn it into an opportunity – perhaps the acquirer has a fully integrated HR department that could pick up the slack. Regardless, trying to hide the issue raises suspicions.\nIf your company’s being sued or you are pursuing a suit against another entity, and either lawsuit could materially impact your business, there isn’t much chance you’ll be able to sell until everything’s sorted.\nIf there’s any environmental contamination on your business property, the chance of selling is greatly diminished. You must complete environmental testing and, if necessary, remediation before a deal can be done. For minor cleanup issues, a Phase 1 environmental audit (which inspects and reviews past uses of the land) and disclosure of the problem is probably enough. However, many deals have broken down over these concerns.\n“Normalizations” is the polite term used to reference expenses that won’t recur under new ownership. It’s often a euphemism for personal expenses put through a business to minimize taxes, such as salaried spouses and children who provide little or no services to the company. Normalizations come in many forms. I once asked an owner of a consumer products business about the “marine equipment” item on the income statement. Turns out it was expenses related to a yacht he used for corporate entertaining — not something that generally passes muster with Revenue Canada as an eligible business expense. Someone who plans to sell a company in the next year or two should eliminate or minimize normalizations on the income statement and stop running personal expenses through the business. Doing this will increase the value and price the business eventually sells for, since earnings will be higher and most valuations are based on a multiple of earnings. It will also reduce the number of embarrassing conversations about dubious accounting practices.\nThis often occurs when a vendor is uncertain about selling. When",
        "baseline": " a prospective buyer asks for basic financial and operational information and the documentation comes back late or incomplete, the buyer gets discouraged. The condition is also sparked when a seller makes unreasonable demands regarding the structure, timing or any number of other deal-related issues. The most painful negotiators bring up the same points repeatedly even after they were already agreed, which soon causes the prospective buyer to walk. Therefore, advise owners to be completely ready to sell their businesses before they start the process.\nIf you owe outstanding tax claims or are negotiating a tax matter with Revenue Canada, you might be able to provide an indemnification for the claim if it’s not a material amount. If the sum is significant, prospective purchasers might prefer to wait until the matter is settled.\nIn conclusion, the vendor’s goal should be to deliver a going concern to the buyer with a minimum of interruption.

        "prompt": "As TBS gears up to host its first-ever Final Four, the Turner network is pulling out all the stops on the promotional front. In a sense, the TBS marketing team’s challenge is to effectively help fans break a 32-year habit, inasmuch as the national semifinals have aired on CBS since 1982.\nWhile the various executions are literally too numerous to list, suffice it to say that the usual suspects are all in play. There are linear spots running in heavy rotation on TBS, TNT, truTV, CNN and HLN, a color strip ad in Friday morning’s USA Today, digital out-of-home displays in 31 markets, and an integration with NCAA.com.\nOn game day (Saturday, April 5), TBS will tap a number of digital outlets, including Xbox, Pandora, YouTube, Spotify, Facebook and Twitter. A day-long homepage takeover of the USA Today site is also set to tip off tomorrow morning.\nSaturday also marks the debut of TBS’ Teamcast coverage, which is designed to super-serve diehard fans of Florida, UConn, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Along with the national broadcast on TBS, which reaches 98.6 million households, Turner will simulcast each game on two of its other networks. For example, when the Huskies and Gators square off in the first game, a Florida-centric telecast will run on TNT while a UConn-friendly presentation can be seen on truTV. The same applies to the 8:49 p.m. EDT game (Wildcats-Badgers).\nWhereas the primary telecast will feature CBS Sports’ Jim Nantz and Greg Anthony and TNT’s Steve Kerr, the Teamcast games will be called by announcers with ties to a particular team. For example, the UConn truTV simulcast will be called by CSN New England’s Eric Frede and former Huskies small forward Donny Marshall.\nAlong with catering to each team’s fan base, the Teamcast coverage promises to generate some incremental ad sales revenue for Turner and CBS.\nThe 2013 Final Four averaged 15.7 million viewers and a 9.4 household rating, up 3 percent from the previous year. Louisville-Wichita State drew 14.5 million viewers and an 8.7 HH rating in the early window, while Michigan-Syracuse scared up 17.1 million fans and a 10.2 HH rating.\nPer Kantar Media, Turner and CBS together raked in $1.15 billion in March Madness ad sales revenue, marking the second consecutive year the two partners generated a 10-figure haul. The college hoops tourney beat out the NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl ($",
        "baseline": "1.1 billion) and the NBA Playoffs and Championship Series ($929 million) for bragging rights as TV’s most lucrative sporting event.\nFor what it’s worth, insiders say that the Kantar estimates are just a tiny bit inflated.\nThe average price of a 30-second spot in the April 8, 2013 championship game on CBS was $1.42 million, up 6 percent from the prior year. The top advertisers in last season’s tournament were General Motors, which invested $80.7 million, AT&T ($70 million), Anheuser-Busch InBev ($38.9 million), Coca-Cola ($37 million) and Capital One ($36.8 million). All but A-B are official NCAA sponsors.

        "prompt": "Marx or Madison: Which Revolutionary Do You Stand With?\nThis is a rush transcript from \"Glenn Beck,\" January 4, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nGLENN BECK, HOST: We&apos;re kicking off the new year, 2010, with final arguments on all the big issues that we laid out the case last year. You need to make a decision before we can move forward.\nDo you believe many of the people in the White House follow the beliefs of this revolutionary? This is James Madison. Or this revolutionary, Karl Marx? You have to decide, because it really is one or the other. It&apos;s either James Madison or Karl Marx.\nYou can&apos;t just take a pinch of Madison and add a dash of Marx; they&apos;re diametrically opposed to each other. I will tell you that I am presenting one side of the argument. I desperately would like the other side of the argument. I try to do my homework as I showed you earlier today.\nBut unless that phone rings, this is the only side of the argument you will hear because the White House will not call to refute anything. They refuse to set the record straight. Instead, all they do is attack. They attack me. They attack this network. They attack tea party goers. You name it — anyone who stands in their way.\nThe White House has only responded to myself and FOX by saying, \"It&apos;s not really a news network at this point.\" Well, some of the George Soros-funded, Hillary Clinton-created liberal blogs named me, as I told you earlier, mis-informer of the year.\nWell, gee, it&apos;s funny, because they weren&apos;t able to come up with a single lie or piece of actual misinformation. They only listed several of my opinions and then they disagreed with those and responded with their opinions. That is called debate.\nThis is a tactic from the radical leftist Saul Alinsky. Talk about the facts, guys. No, no, no. Instead, Saul Alinsky — he said, pick the target. Freeze it. Personalize it and polarize it. That&apos;s what they&apos;re doing. It&apos;s a distraction.\nAnd it&apos;s a dangerous distraction because they&apos;re moving on with their agenda. Well, I&apos;m done, America, and I hope you are about finished with this distraction and this game. Until we&apos;re having an open and honest debate — and we know where everyone is coming from, truly, case closed.\nI&apos;ve been showing you the evidence tonight and here is some more. I&apos;ve just mentioned this guy, Saul Alinsky. Not a lot of people know who this guy was at least two years ago. They had no idea of Saul Alinsky. Many in America still don&apos;t know who he was.\nWell, let me tell you, he was a radical leftist who wrote the book — in fact, I have it on the stack over there — \"Rules for Radicals.\" He wanted to take from the haves and give to the have-nots. That&apos;s not this revolutionary. That&apos;s this revolutionary.\nHe wouldn&apos;t put a label on himself, but that puts you much closer to Marx than Madison. He also said, \"The ends justify almost any means.\" He also said, quote, \"Success or failure is determinant of ethics.\"\nOK, that&apos;s weird. It always thought ethics and morals were the starting point. But not according to Saul Alinsky. See, ethics start — either start at the ethics — that&apos;s more Madison than Marx. To Saul Alinsky, those are just an afterthought.\nSaul Alinsky is irrelevant in today&apos;s world. That&apos;s what the left will tell you. That&apos;s what the left - the left will mock you, \"Oh, they&apos;re bringing up some `60s radical again. Oh, please, he&apos;s old news.\" Is he?\nDo you remember this photo? Let me show you the photo. Remember this? This is President Barack Obama, Professor Barack Obama back in Chicago. No one in the media bothered to look at what he wrote on this blackboard. I did, a couple months back.\nIt did the journalist&apos;s job for them. Here they are. Can you show that? Here I am, showing it&apos;s November 18th. You know what he was teaching? He was teaching Saul Alinsky. This is Saul Alinsky&apos;s tactics. It&apos;s spread the wealth. The socialist who — morally bankrupt individual who would use any means to achieve his ends.\nHe is willing to teach the views of Saul Alinsky. But what do the rest of us get? No comment. President Barack Obama declined an interview request on the topic of Saul Alinsky during the campaign. No, he doesn&apos;t want to talk about it. He&apos;ll teach it, but he won&apos;t talk about it.\nWell, that doesn&apos;t make sense because, I mean, if you&apos;re a professor who stood at the blackboard and taught Saul Alinsky, you should be an expert on him. You should know. You should know where you stand on Saul Alinsky and his tactics and no American president would accept Saul Alinsky. They would all reject him.\nWell, he knows who he is, because he taught him. So the question remains, is the president of the United States a Saul Alinsky guy? More Marx than Madison? Or is our president more Madison than Marx?\nSee, the media won&apos;t follow up on these questions because the same goes for them. The media is more Marx than Madison. Some love him so much that they get a thrill up their leg when they hear President Obama speak. Chris Matthews said that.\nHe also said that it was, quote, \"My job to make this presidency a success,\" end quote. Well, what does Chris Matthews, the man who loves this president so much, say about Saul Alinsky, a guy who is completely irrelevant, remember? Roll the tape.\nCHRIS MATHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Well, to reach back to one of our heroes from the past, from the &apos;60s, Saul Alinsky, who once said that even though both sides have flaws in their arguments and you can always find something nuanced about your own side you don&apos;t like, and it&apos;s never perfect, you have to act in the end, like there is simple, black-and-white clarity between your side and the other side or you don&apos;t get anything done. I always try to remind myself of Saul Alinsky when I get confused.\nBECK: Yes. By the way, he was talking to the only socialist in the Congress, Bernie Sanders. And that happened two days before Christmas, or maybe it was three days before Christmas.\nMr. Thrill-Up-My-Leg-Over-Obama always tries to remind himself of, quote, \"one of our heroes of the past, Saul Alinsky.\" One of our heroes. I found the keyword there to be \"our,\" Chris Matthews. Many in the media who cheerlead for this president also hold up Saul Alinsky as their hero, the same Saul Alinsky who wants to take from the haves and give to have-nots.\nGee, where did we hear this before? The same Saul Alinsky who will let success determine his morals. The same Saul Alinsky who will use any means possible to achieve his ends.\nLet me give you one more name here. I talked about him before we went on vacation. It&apos;s this guy, Robert Creamer. Remember him? Robert Cream",
        "baseline": "er - the guy the press and the top presidential advisers, all of the people on the left, excuse a $2 million bank fraud because he was just trying to help the poor.\nWhat is it that Saul Alinsky said? Let success determine your morals and any means possible to achieve those ends. Boy, that fits Saul Alinsky. It fits Creamer. It fits the media. Does it fit the professor who knows Saul Alinsky&apos;s extraordinary tactics extraordinarily well? Professor Barack Obama?\nI believe it&apos;s beyond a reasonable doubt. Case closed. I know where the media stands. I know where the elites are in Washington. The question is, where do you stand, America? You must make it clear. You decide. They&apos;re both revolutionaries. They both had detractors and people who love them in the White House.\nYou must decide and send a very clear message. Which revolutionary are you for: Marx or Madison?",

        "prompt": "Impact Wrestling Star On How Chris Jericho Could Benefit The Company - Wrestling Inc.\n\"At this point I wouldn't be shocked because of everything you just read. Canadian-based company, Don Callis, Scott D'Amore, I wouldn't be shocked. Before when he teased years ago coming in I would be like, 'Ah, that's not gonna happen', but now I wouldn't be as shocked. Jericho's doing his own thing, he's going off to New Japan and his cruise and all that kind of stuff. He doesn't really need WWE anymore. He's got his band, all that kind of stuff. So why not for him have a little bit of fun? I've even heard him getting in his last run backstage he'd be be getting heat with somebody because politics, whatever the case may be. He's gonna come to IMPACT and there'd be none of that.\n\"But let me say this, I have no idea if he's coming. I figured those decisions will probably be held really close to Scott, Don, probably Sonjay and Jimmy. Those are probably the only four people that know if he comes. If he doesn't come in or if he comes. But they're not gonna spread that, they're not gonna let that leak out or whatever the case may be. And then the next question is what do they do? Who does he feud with? When does he come? How does he so it? All that kind of stuff which will probably be for future podcasts if he ends up coming to IMPACT.\"\n\"Oh yeah, absolutely. It's business, pretty much. TV is business, right? So the hardest part about TV and all that kind of stuff is getting on network television, okay? That's the hardest part. You look at companies and stuff like that and they have all the talent in the world, it's just hard to get a TV deal. There's only so many spots, so many TV shows. There's more than just wrestling shows going for those spots. It's hard.\n\"Back when we first went to Spike and Rhyno was our champion, in Windsor at a BCW show we had to put the belt back on Jeff Jarrett. Why? Because he was our most recognizable person for us to go onto Spike TV with. Rhyno wasn't. Jeff Jarrett was. And at the time, I think we were just getting the Dudleys. So that was like us getting bigger stars and all that kind of stuff. So yeah definitely use those names as marketing tools and bargaining tools and all those things for bigger contracts, for television or going to a different network or whatever the case may be. So yeah, absolutely.\"\n\"Yeah, you're gonna use Jericho as a bargaining tool. Obviously you look at what networks are bigger, you look at how many viewers potentially can watch Pop, right? Which is less than how many viewers can potentially watch Spike. I always go back to Spike because that's probably the biggest network we've ever been on. At the end of the day, I think any wrestling company would want to be on broadcast television if they were big enough. Not cable, but the ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox type thing, those ones where you only need an antenna to watch it, if wrestling were that big again. I mean that's the goal, right? Or to get on cable shows that are providers for... you know, they're on all the cable packages and that kind of stuff. So yeah, definitely.\n\"If IMPACT can move to a network that has more potential viewers, they're gonna go for it. It'd be stupid not to. You can't build a company and stay stagnant if you didn't. But it's not like I'm saying anything that's edgy or anything because I think Pop knows that like, 'Hey, this company grows, they're probably gonna leave us or unless we give them more money or whatever, maybe they will be the ones that are like flagship show pretty much'. It's like, 'Hey, they're gonna help our network build' and in that case then they lean on us more and then they'd have to pay us more money and all that kind of stuff. Everybody knows it's business. Everybody.\"\n\"I would say 'great'. I've never actually met Chris",
        "baseline": " Jericho. He knows who I am, just judging from some of his podcasts. He has interviewed guys who I've wrestled and all that kind of stuff. I have no idea what his thoughts are of me. I really dont. I mean he could be one of those guys that says to me, 'That Canadian Destroyer move is stupid! You killed the business!' and all that kind of stuff, or he could be like, 'Hey man, great job getting that move over' and all that kind of stuff or whatever. I mean, I'm all for it. Anything that's gonna help the company build and stuff like that, I've never heard he has a negative reputation, or a bad reputation I should say, and he's already a locker room leader over at WWE when he goes there. So what's not to like? And he's been in the business since before I even started wrestling. If anything, I think it would just be good for our product pretty much.\"",

How many of those people would you suspect are loyal, that is planning on sticking with the company? 34! How many of those people would you estimate are headed out the door? 36!\nThese findings from the 2007 Walker Loyalty Report for Loyalty in the Workplace states that just 34% of employees are sticking while another 36% are about to walk. That leaves 30% who either haven’t made up their minds or are just going with the flow.\nShould you be concerned? I think so. If only a third of the people are with you then it means that two-thirds are either on the fence or going against you. No wonder you have difficulty getting things done.\nThe Walker Report measures loyalty five ways: fairness at work, care and concern, trust in employees, and feelings of accomplishment, and daily job satisfaction. Managers can affect all of these factors, but the single most important one may be trust. Trust is an operative driver; it affects the other four. So if you want to boost loyalty, then attacking trust may be the leverage point, but it is one that may be the most difficult to establish.\nDo what you say you will do. Obvious, of course! But how often have you seen a manager make a promise and forget it? It happens everyday. So how can you make certain you follow through? Document it. Let people know what you plan to accomplish. When you finish, let folks know. More importantly, if you are falling short, either due to lack of time or resources, raise your hand – tell people about it. Give them a progress report. Then follow up until you do follow through.\nBack your people when it counts. When a milestone is achieved, the boss needs to share the glory. More especially, he needs to put the team first. That is, talk up their achievements to senior management. Some folks will think this will jeopardize their chances of advancement. Maybe, but in the long run, reflecting glory positions you as a team player as well as one who puts people into positions where they can succeed.\nTake one for the team. Tough times call for tough",

Managers who hold themselves personally accountable for results are managers who know how to take the heat. They have confidence enough to put up with the flak from up top. By doing so they earn respect of their employees.\nDeveloping trust is important; it directly affects retention. It can boost loyalty rates among employees by positively affecting factors like fairness, accomplishment and job satisfaction. And that means dollars. Right Management, a leading human resources consulting firm, estimates that it costs employers 2.5 times an individual’s salary to replace that person. Those costs come from recruitment, training, and diminished productivity.\nSo bend a little, give a little, and buck up your team. Trust yourself and your team.

The hip-hop artist is the closest thing this decade has to a true rock star, fabled for temper tantrums, genre busting and fearlessly speaking truth to power -- whether that be rap's homophobia or George Bush's appalling absence during Katrina. But in 2009, West was drinking his own Kool-Aid, and that Kool-Aid was apparently made of straight Courvoisier.\nIt's one thing to pitch a fit about losing a music award to another artist -- which West has done, many times -- but it's another thing entirely to protest someone else's award loss, stealing the spotlight from a perfectly adorable 19-year-old singer-songwriter in what was -- for, oh, about 15 seconds -- the greatest moment of her life.

Though West later told Jay Leno he never properly mourned his mother's death, throwing himself into his work, the cracks had started showing -- in 2008, he was arrested following an altercation with paparazzi. Then he released the synth-pop/R&B hybrid \"808s & Heartbreak,\" a musical experiment that could perhaps be best described as part genius, part folly, part WTF.\nKanye West's greatest songs have often been about a man caught on the wrong side of redemption.

        "prompt": "The future of St. Isaac’s Cathedral, one of Russia’s most important historical sites, is uncertain. The imperial monument in St. Petersburg has served as a state museum for ninety years. But now, city authorities plan to transfer the building to the control of the Russian Orthodox Church, causing a bitter dispute between the people of St. Petersburg, conservationists and clerics.\nOn Jan. 10, St. Petersburg’s governor Georgy Poltavchenko announced that the state would gift the landmark to the church in an agreement which will last 49 years.\nSt. Isaac’s is known for its lavish interiors and golden domes, which provide some of the best views on Russia’s former imperial capital. It took 40 years to build, largely overseen by the repressive reign of Nicholas I and finally finished under Alexander II in 1858. In the 1930s, the Soviets turned the building into an anti-religious museum. But since the fall of the USSR, the UNESCO world heritage has housed a state museum with a permanent exhibition while also hosting religious sermons.\nChurch officials have said that in the West, pointing specifically to Italy and the Vatican, cathedrals are operated by religious authorities. They have also promised that the cathedral will remain open to the public. In a press conference, the spokesman for the Orthodox Church Vladimir Legoida said it plans to scrap the 250 ruble fee to enter St. Isaac’s and pledged to “guarantee access” to it.\nBut opponents of the move doubt that these promises will be kept.\n“It will be destroyed,” says Nikolay Burov, the museum’s current director. He clarifies that nobody will literally destroy the building but that the new management will be unable to cope with its maintenance. “I am a realistic man of the 21st century, I know how the economics of this place work,” says Burov, adding that St. Isaac’s requires constant renovation and employs almost 400 people.\nBurov worries that under the authority of the church, St. Isaac’s will lose its “utilitarian function” as a public building open to the people of St. Petersburg.\nHe is not alone in this opinion—the city did not take the decision well. Over 190,000 people have signed an online petition against the decision. The day after Poltavchenko announced the news, a few hundred people gathered outside the cathedral in a spontaneous protest demanding city authorities retract the decision.\n“St. Isaac’s is a symbol of our city and its fate should be decided by the citizens of St. Petersburg,” says Bogdan Litvin, one of the organisers of the protest. Instead, the decision was made by one person: the governor Poltavchenko.\n“We should solve this issue using direct democracy,” says local pollster Roman Mogilevsky. Protesters, who plan another demonstration on Jan. 28, are demanding a referendum on the fate of the building. But city authorities have already dismissed this idea. St. Petersburg’s ultra conservative vice governor Mikhail Mokretsov called this idea “an exotic way to fulfill federal law,” further angering protesters.\nIt is not the first time controversy around the question of St. Isaac’s ownership has arisen in the city. Burov says this debate goes back 150 years, when the cathedral was first built. In prerevolutionary Russia, the church’s Synod asked the imperial government to transfer St. Isaac’s from the jurisdiction of the interior ministry to the full control of the church—but it repeatedly refused to do so.\nBurov sees echoes of the same debate in today’s Russia.\nOnly last Spring, city authorities rejected a church request to hand over the building on economic grounds. Then, local church authorities grew quiet and did not protest the decision. Yet, less than a year later, the St. Petersburg government appears to have made a U-turn.\n“This could only have come from the Kremlin,” says Andrei Desnitsky, an expert on the Russian Orthodox Church. “It looks like an exchange for a favor,” he adds. Desnitsky believes the timing of the affair is no coincidence. As Russia enters the centenary year of the Russian revolution, the state will be looking to emphasize national unity over rifts. The Kremlin may be looking to stage a show in which it needs church support.\nOne of these shows could be burying the remains of Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria, which were found in an Ural forest, separated from the rest of Russia’s murdered royal family. Funerals for the pair were repeatedly scheduled and repeatedly called off by the church, which does not recognize the remains as authentic despite scientists largely agreeing on the matching DNA. “Burying them could be a strong political signal for the state this year,” says Desnitsky. In order to do so, the Kremlin would require church participation. Gifting St Isaac’s to the Patriarchy could convince it to agree.\nBurov, too, cannot help but draw the parallel to the centenary. “I am a statesman not a revolutionary, but I do not think this is the right way to mark this jubilee,” he says.\nSince the fall of the USSR, the transfer of religious buildings to the church has been ongoing, but the institution’s power as a landlord has been strengthened significantly under Putin. In 2010, the Duma passed a law allowing major state buildings to return to the church. In 2016 alone, 133 buildings were given to the patriarchy and there are thousands more listed as eligible for the",
        "baseline": " same treatment on the official site of Russia’s Federal Agency for State Property.\nThe more property the church gains, the more conservationists fear for its ability to look after the buildings. “I worry that there are not enough voices inside the church who think about how to look after the buildings,” Desnitsky says. Even the burning of scented candles during religious ceremonies damages interiors.\nKonstantin Mikhailov, the head of Russia’s conservationist society Arkhnadzor, calls for calm in the situation. “We need to think of the church as a business,” he says, calling for it to put forward a plan on how it will finance and maintain St Isaac’s. Making the plans for the maintenance of the public cathedral, he warns, should happen before, not after, the takeover. “This is a national treasure and we cannot afford to experiment with it,” says Mikhailov.",

Over the river and through the Internet woods, boy did my eyes roll.\nTedious and confounding, the 206-page book's useful parts (what Malinak would call \"nuggets\") are obscured by throat-clearers -- empty set-ups that dither until you get to your point. I fall into throat-clearing mode when I'm, you know, speaking. But on the page, they might as well be lethal: accidental death from clinging to the Jane Schaffer method of paragraph-writing. \"Nothing kills your business like wasting time.\" \"Every year, new cameras come out with improved features.\" Pretty soon I'm going to end this sentence and start another one.\nHere's the thing: Malinak and I are in total agreement. Etsy is awesome. The 400,000 vendors on the self-touted \"world's online marketplace for handmade and vintage items\" sell everything from Game of Thrones maps to eco-friendly engagement rings to Jon Stewart onesies. My 10 purchases from Etsy -- eBay's successor and Pinterest's precursor -- include a hand-stamped \"I Read Banned Books\" bracelet.\nMalinak is an accountant, not a writer. He caters to advice seeking customers with eBooks and spreadsheets in a pair of Etsy shops. Last year, Etsy sold $538 million in goods. Piggybacking on such success, authors have turned books about Etsy into a small publishing subcategory. (Starting an Etsy Business for Dummies; Etsy 101: Sell Your Crafts on Etsy, the DIY marketplace for handmade, vintage & crafting supplies; Regretsy: Where DIY Meets WTF, et cetera.) Malinak's CPA background offers a new angle.\nWhile he claims not to be an artist, Malinak takes major creative license with the exclamation point (on one page, I counted five), even wedging one in after the word \"audit.\" Ahem [throat clear], I mean \"audit!\" In a recent essay for The Atlantic's website, Grantland writer Rembert Browne summed up the anti-Malinak approach: \"I would be lying if I described my feelings toward seeing an exclamation point as loathe or not a fan of. The hate in my heart for the misused, overly used piece of punctuation is very real, and I couldn't be prouder, seeing as that it might be the only thing I truly stand for.\" Malinak's exclamation points reminded me of the airplane trick parents use to spoon-feed babies -- watch the birdie while we learn about bookkeeping, taxes and operations.\nSince Malinak's not an Etsy employee, readers miss out on the Etsy origin story (I understand his point of view, but I almost felt -- stupidly -- that Malinak denied one of the founders the chance to write a this-is-how-we-did-it-back-in-2005 book with the titular neologism \"Etsy-preneurship\"). I struggled to determine Malinak's target audience, and also whether the book was well-timed. Initially, the book seemed explicitly meant for crafters who are actively planning an Etsy outpost. However, Malinak's six core strategies apply to the foundation all businesses. Achieving top positions in an Etsy search function is exactly like navigating the world of search engine optimization to get your website a higher Google ranking. He extolls the value of branding above all else, and provides a very practical pricing formula (direct raw material costs + indirect raw material costs + other direct costs + allocated overhead + markup ± psychological pricing adjustments = your retail price). Every type of protocol is explained step-by-step. (Etsy, PayPal, shipping fees.) All of his mission statement and goal-setting convictions are low-concept common sense, yet compiled in a reassuring read so future \"Etsians\" forget nothing.\nThe article \"Etsy Goes Pro\" from the October issue of Wired legitimized Etsy to the tech",
        "baseline": "ies and data specialists who previously couldn't have cared less about a website that sells replicas of Bert and Ernie's pajamas (ok they don't, but they should).

There's always the question of when Etsy will go public. The once sparse staff has grown to 160, and social-media watchers are scrutinizing the company's moves.

        "baseline": " browsers to implement similar restrictions, amplifying the negative impact to Criteo&apos;s financial results.\nOf course, Criteo could also opt to provide some clarity by outlining exactly how much revenue it currently generates from Google products, as well as its potential courses of action to mute the impact of any potential changes Google might make. But I suspect we won&apos;t receive any such clarification until Google makes a final decision regarding its way forward. In the meantime, given the rising chorus of skeptics on Wall Street, it seems likely that Criteo shares will remain under pressure.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool&apos;s board of directors.

It cleared the panel in a 28-20 party-line vote.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi supports the legislation and plans to bring it to an eventual vote in the full Democratic-held chamber. If the House passes the bill, it would mark the most significant step toward raising the federal minimum wage since 2009, the last time the pay floor increased. The U.S. currently has a $7.25 minimum wage.\nThe legislation has only a slim chance of becoming law. Republicans in the GOP-held Senate — like their colleagues in the House — will likely oppose it. The White House has also trashed the idea of hiking the federal wage floor, though President Donald Trump has not weighed in recently himself.\nDemocrats see the measure as a way to cast themselves as the better party for working Americans ahead of key 2020 presidential and congressional elections. They have cast Republicans as out of touch — particularly through criticizing the GOP tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans.\nDemocrats say the legislation would give nearly 40 million American workers a raise. They argue the increase will help laborers better keep up with rising costs of living, and boost the economy by giving those workers more money to spend. Under the bill, the pay floor would rise to $15 per hour in 2024 and would continue to climb in line with median wage growth.\n\"We now have an opportunity – and a responsibility – to restore the value of the minimum wage, lift millions of hardworking people out of poverty, and boost the economy in Main Street America,\" Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said in opening a bill markup hearing Wednesday.\nRepublicans have argued the plan would hurt small-business owners by increasing costs. It would force them to cut positions and hours for low-wage workers and potentially increase automation, critics contend.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business organization in the nation, has also lined up against the legislation.\n\"Going from a $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage to a $15 an hour minimum wage is, at best, a foolish policy proposal,\" committee ranking member Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said Wednesday. \"At worst, it's an intentionally dishonest political stunt that promises bigger paychecks to hardworking Americans when in reality it would result in significant job losses for millions of hourly workers around the country.\"\nThe debate over a $15 per hour federal minimum wage comes as states and cities around the country have increasingly embraced",
        "baseline": " the wage floor. Organizations such as Fight for $15 have pushed governments around the country to hike their minimum wages.\nIn a statement distributed by Fight for $15, Bobby Fields, a McDonald's worker in Florida, said members of the organization moved \"one step closer\" to their goal on Wednesday. \"We're going to keep on fighting and keep on going on strike until all workers get the $15 minimum wage and a union we need,\" he said.\nLast month, New Jersey and Illinois became the fourth and fifth states to pass $15 per hour minimum wages. Twenty-nine states currently have higher minimum wages than the federal level, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nSome critics of a federal minimum wage hike have argued states should decide appropriate pay floors based on cost of living. In October, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow called a U.S. wage hike a \"terrible idea,\" arguing that \"Idaho is different than New York.\"",
        "llm_baseline": "the idea.The District of Columbia,New York, andMassachusetts have all passed laws to raise their minimum wage to$7 per hour.The District of Columbia has also passed laws to raise their$15 per hour minimum wage.The federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009,when it rose to$7.25 per hour.The last time it increased was in 2007-08,when it rose from$5 to$ 15 per hour.The federal minimum wage was$1.60 to$60 per hour in 1968,when it was last adjusted for inflation.The federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009,when it rose to$7.25 per hour.The last time it increased was in 2007,when it rose from$5 to$15per hour.The federal minimum wage was$1.60 to$.60 per hour in 1968,when it was last adjusted for inflation.The federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009,when it rose to$7.25 per hour.The last time it increased was in 2007,when it rose from$7 to.25 per hour.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

        "prompt": "The documentary Dogs on the Inside explores the relationships between abused rescue dogs and prison inmates working towards a second chance. One of those inmates shares his story.\nMy name is Candido Santiago. I served a 10-year prison sentence at North Central Correctional Institution in Massachusetts for selling cocaine and was released last year.\nIn the final year of my sentence, I was one of the first inmates to sign up for a dog-training program run by Correctional Officer Reagan, which was supported by an organization called Don’t Throw Us Away. The program partners inmates with dogs rescued from Southern kill shelters where they in turn care for and help rehabilitate the dogs over the course of eight weeks, caring for its every need. I rehabilitated, trained, loved, and cared for six stray dogs over the course of that year. These dogs had experienced tough pasts, like myself and the other inmates. The dogs had been abandoned, neglected, or abused—sometimes all three. From the start, I made it a point to show each dog compassion and to earn their trust. I decided to participate because I am a dog lover and wanted the opportunity to have a companion while I was in prison, as well as learn how to train a dog.\nMy experience working with dogs in prison had a huge impact on my life. At times during my sentence, I was really lonely and no one visited me. It was very tough. I once sent myself a card in the mail with my address on it just so I would have a letter to look forward to receiving. These dogs always lent me a non-judgmental ear when I talked to them, which is hard to find in an environment like prison. They were the ultimate companions. Each dog I was responsible for provided me love, trust, confidence, and a purpose.\nThere was one dog in particular, a chihuahua named Sam, which really needed a lot of attention, love, and patience from me. When he first arrived, Sam wouldn’t come out of his crate at all. Let me tell you, it’s not easy building a bond with a dog when they are nervous, shaking, and won’t come out of their crate. So every day I crawled halfway into his crate to let him know I was there for him and I wasn’t going to hurt him. Eventually, Sam started to trust me and I didn’t have to crawl into his crate anymore! During my time with these dogs, I developed a bond with all of them and I cried when each of them left to go to their new home. It was bittersweet but I knew they were going to a much better place than prison, that’s for sure!\nI was able to gain momentum in bettering my sense of self-worth from all of the positive feelings the dogs gave me, which carried over as I was preparing to leave prison and re-enter society.\nThe dogs helped us inmates become closer as well, as evidenced by members from rival gangs being able to find a common ground in the program. There were two gang members representing different colors who wouldn’t speak to each other. At one point, they were even on the verge of fighting. When the program came, it took a little bit of time, but bonding over the dogs eventually led to a friendship between both men.\nCurrently, I am employed at a bakery that makes éclairs, where I work 12-hour shifts on the assembly line.

I don’t have a dog now because my landlord won’t allow them, but I take care of my brother’s dog and am going to begin volunteering at my local dog shelter.\nI know I made a difference in the lives of those dogs, and they certainly made a huge impact on mine.

        "prompt": "UNITED NATIONS, April 12 -- A day after Inner City Press asked, on the 126 rapes in Minova, what “assurances” UN Peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous had gotten, the question was belatedly half-answered at Friday's noon briefing. “Several” alleged rapists have been arrested; some commanders of unnamed battalions have been suspended.\nInner City Press immediately asked if \"several\" arrests meant just the three it asked about, and for the UN to now name the battalions.\nWe say “belatedly” because after Inner City Press on April 11 asked the question, and before Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's deputy spokesman Eduardo Del Buey read out the UN's response 24 hours later, Ladsous' spokesman Kieran Dwyer gave the answer to Inner City Press' question to Louis Charbonneau of Reuters and Tim Witcher of AFP, Ladsous' first and main defender.\nIn the past Ban's lead spokesman Martin Nesirky has tried to excuse this blatant favoring or use of media friendier to Ladsous as out of his control. He told Inner City Press that when HE get the answer, he gives it to Inner City Press.\nBut on Friday Ban's deputy spokesman Del Buey said that HE had the answer to Inner City Press' question, but that Reuters and AFP telephoned for it and it was given.\nHe then claimed paradoxically, but we include it here in fairness, that it is not a question of \"favored\" media. How then should it be phrased? How about, lapdogs?\nWhy not at least make sure to give it to the media which actually asked the question? Del Buey had no answer, said he “noted the objection,” which is also on behalf of the new Free UN Coalition for Access.\nThis type of practice by the UN should have been confronted by the old UN Correspondents Association, but never was. It is that UNCA is run by and for Big Media, mostly the wire services, who benefit as friendly stenographers of UN officials like Ladsous.\nOne Reuters reporter, Michelle “The Troll” Nichols, even claimed that to be spoon-fed answers to Inner City Press' public questions by Ladsous and his three spokespeople constitutes a “scoop” for Reuters.\nNichols said this in a false complaint she filed against Inner",

Kelly was hanged in 1880 for crimes that ranged from robberies to killings to cattle theft. His remains were buried in a Melbourne jail, but exhumed for transfer to another nearby prison in 1929, at which point they were looted and Kelly’s skull disappeared. The remains were again exhumed in 2009 after a skull claimed to be Kelly’s was presented to officials.\nCalled a “cold-blooded murderer” by some and celebrated as “a folk hero” by others, Kelly led a small gang that robbed banks, incited the Irish-Australian population to revolt, burned an entire town’s mortgage deeds and dictated a notable letter protesting the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police",

In the final now-legendary shootout that led to Kelly’s arrest, his gang wore suits of body armor, possibly fashioned from moldboards plows and weighing 96 lbs. each, strong enough to repel bullets. Kelly was shot repeatedly in the legs (the suits didn’t protect the body below the waist), captured, tried and sentenced to death.\nThe DNA match was secured with the aid of a sample taken from Leigh Olver, a Melbourne schoolteacher and the great grandson of Kelly’s sister.\n“To think a group of scientists could identify the body of a man who was executed more than 130 years ago, moved and buried in a haphazard fashion among 33 other prisoners — most of whom are not identified — is amazing,” said Victoria Attorney General Robert Clark in a statement.\nThanks to the DNA tests, we also know the skull isn’t Kelly’s.

In furtherance of our campaign for the February 16 polls, we have mounted our campaign materials all over the state just like any other candidate; it was, however, a rude shock to us and for me particularly as a senatorial candidate of PDP in Ekiti Central to wake up on Monday morning to the ugly acts of some undemocratic forces who went all over the state to vandalise our campaign materials and remove many of them.\n“We found out that only the materials for me and other candidates of the PDP were so vandalised by those hoodlums. We also observed that none of the materials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was so vandalised; this unequivocally establishes the fact that it was done by either member of APC or hoodlums, criminals sympathetic to APC; we noted in particular, one of our billboards in front of Eyitayo estate on Iworoko Road, Ado Ekiti, was vandalised by miscreants who were within the convoy of the VP, and there are eyewitnesses to this development. It is very clear that this was done by the APC and we are worried by the fact that the ruling APC is displaying intolerance to the opposition in the state.\n“Maybe they wanted to give an impression to the VP that they are the only one on ground here; we want the world to know that the stronghold of PDP is Ekiti Central senatorial district; this is a PDP state and it has been demonstrated by the results of past polls in the state since 2003.\n“The democratic space is been polluted and shrunk by the activities of these undemocratic elements in the state. We demand peaceful, free and fair polls not only in Ekiti but in the nation. It is the only way we can guarantee true democracy; what happened in Ekiti on Monday if not checked was a message that the opposition cannot operate freely in the state but we refuse to be intimidated. I urge my supporters not to remain undaunted, determined and hold out firmly against oppression, intimidation and undemocratic forces; Nigeria is a great country and Ekiti is a land of honour; we want to behave ourselves honourably and we plead with the ruling party to allow peace to reign in the state. One of the hallmarks of democracy is a periodic change in administration through democratic elections; this election cannot be considered democratic if the ruling party is not allowing the opposition to operate freely.\n“The presidential candidate of the PDP Atiku Abubabar visited Ekiti last week and PDP members did not vandalise campaign materials of APC or other parties because Atiku was in town; what would APC have lost if they allowed the VP to know that there are other parties campaigning in Ekiti. I tell you, the highest form of deceit is self-deceit; what APC is trying to do is to give a false impression that they are the only one on the ground, but by the results of the coming polls, we will show them",

We don’t want those who come from Abuja to think that it is only APC; no matter how those who are in power think they are, the peoples’ power is greater.\nThe APC has not been campaigning in our senatorial district; we hear rumours that they want to rig the polls, but we warn them against this. No one should dare rig the polls. We are peaceful people. Everyone knows that Obafemi Adewale is a peaceful living man, a gentleman. All my followers know that they must conduct themselves decently. This is how we want those in opposition and say they are the ruling party to conduct themselves.\n“The VP has been campaigning against hate speeches; he should now start campaigning against hateful actions which are being done by members of his party now,” he said.\nOne year down the road, has fire gone off Liberia’s Weah?",

        "prompt": "When buying a commercial app or working with a vendor to create one from scratch, organizations are specifying too many requirements, including ones that are non-essential or cosmetic. According to one Info-Tech Research Group Ltd. consultant, the key to successfully selecting a vendor for packaged or custom applications is to identify core requirements quickly and keep the initial selection team small.\n“If you have a team of more than five people who are commissioned with finding the right solution and requirements, you’re probably wasting a lot of effort,” said Andy Woyzbun, lead analyst at London, Ont.-based research and consultant firm. Especially for customized projects, design by large committee almost never works, he added.\nWhile some organizations gather staff from across multiple departments to work through all aspects of a project — from the initial requirements gather project through to vendor selection — Woyzbun warned that this practice will cause most companies to miss the essentials.\n“Don’t sweat the details until you’re well into the development process,” he advised, adding that it’s a far better strategy to select a vendor or develop a set of key project requirements without wasting too much staff time outside of the initial development team.\nBringing in employees from various departments is great to validate what’s been chosen and what features can be added on top of the core functionality of an application, he said.\nFor example, when building out a payroll system, some employees might want to see customizable fields and fonts show up on their pay stubs. While this is something that should be taken into consideration for the latter stages of the project, the focus of the payroll system needs to be on its core features.\n“Don’t worry about the colours of the walls before you’ve bought the house,” Woyzbun said, adding that the companies he’s worked with tend to “overcook” their requirements and the vendor selection process in general. This is especially true on large ERP, CRM, or business intelligence initiatives, he said.\nThe organizations that keep their requirements teams small and zero in on key objections will waste the least money and get a usable product turned around quicker, Woyzbun said.\nThis advice comes just one month after New Castle, Del.-based software development consultancy IAG Consulting found that the average North American enterprise wastes 33 per cent of their budget on app projects due to",
        "baseline": " immature requirements definition. The firm polled CIOs, IT managers, and business analysts at more than 400 medium-to-large organizations.\n“We’ve found that it doesn’t really matter what development methodology you choose — agile, iterative, or whatever — what matters is how you look at the requirements maturity behind it,” Keith Ellis, the study’s author and a vice president with IAG Consulting, said last month.\nThe research, according to Ellis, indicated that lower-skilled business analysts in higher maturity companies consistently outperformed higher-skilled ones in less mature organizations. “This shows that more important than individual people and individual skills, it’s the collective capability that you need to focus on,” he said.\nDeveloping a proper maturity model framework that covers areas such as staff competency, organizational support, stakeholder communication, and project timeliness is the key in leaving project failures behind, Ellis said.",

        "prompt": "Without robust worker protections built in to single-payer legislation, health-care workers will continue to be undervalued.\nIf you get a check-up at any health clinic in America today, you may have no idea how much it will cost, but two things are virtually certain: The bill will be too high, and the nurse who saw you will be paid too little. The sickening paradox at the root of the American health-care system is that, despite skyrocketing costs for patients, front-line workers like medical assistants and home-care aides are shockingly underpaid—while insurers and health-care corporations pocket the difference. The health-care-reform debate in Washington is finally starting to grapple with the equity gap in the health system for consumers, and momentum is gaining for a fairer government-run single-payer system. Yet, for all the promise of the “Medicare for All” proposal, there’s surprisingly little discussion on how an overhaul of our health-care system would affect the people delivering our care.\nThe new single-payer legislation in Congress, alongside parallel state-level proposals, promise free care for all. But according to Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), however services are financed, hospital-based institutions are set to consolidate and downsize, and workers will be left with more work for less pay.\nCould health-care reform fix the imbalance? By centralizing health-care finance and eliminating private insurance, single payer would protect consumers from corporate profit motives, since all providers would by definition be publicly funded and managed. However, the single-payer proposals currently before Congress include scant detail on labor standards. So, beyond the cost of care for patients, could a better-regulated system also provide a living wage and a union? Would home-care workers get a $15 minimum wage or paid parental leave under Medicare for All? Whether your clinic is funded through an insurance company or a Medicare-for-All-type government-run plan, many workers might end up with a painful pay cut without additional protections for health-care labor.\nUnder current workforce trends, there has been an increase in black workers in outpatient facilities, a doubling of Latino workers, and a more than 80 percent increase in Asian and other workers, with women driving the job growth across sectors. From 2005 to 2015, black men’s earnings sank by more than 12 percent, driven by declining wages for medical technicians and assistants. Female technicians and professional staff in outpatient facilities, while continuing to earn less than male coworkers across the board—with wage gaps of about 8 to 24 percent—earn substantially less than their in-hospital female peers. Even mostly college-educated social- service workers in outpatient centers earn less than $38,000 a year, less than what a unionized nurse might earn in a hospital.\nHowever, given the relative strength of public-sector unions—which, as state-based entities, would presumably be free of union-busting corporate monopolies—a single-payer system could help expand union representation, so that outpatient staff could keep up with the incomes of their counterparts at large medical institutions.\nThis is where organized labor could play a critical role in health-care restructuring: Collective bargaining could ensure fair, stable pay scales and working conditions. There have been strong unionization drives in health care in recent years; for instance, the SEIU has campaigned in several states to provide representation to home",
        "baseline": " health aides who are employed through state-level Medicaid programs—providing a potential model for boosting wages and defending labor rights in non-hospital, community-based care. Still, despite some expanded federal labor protections under Obama, home-care workers overall remain irrationally underpaid, working under high-stress conditions for only about $10 an hour, often without adequate health benefits themselves. These workers, under any management system, will need stronger labor standards combined with a culture shift in the health-care industry that fairly values a labor force that is fueled by women of color and immigrants.\nIn the coming years, the health-care system is poised to restructure to respond to our communities’ diversifying needs. If this system is going to be sustainable for the whole community, the workforce will need an upgrade too.

Doctors give patients small amounts of drug combinations they believe are a good genetic match for the tumor. Then, surgeons remove new growth.\n“In doing so, we can take the tumor that we remove in the operation, test it, and answer two basic questions: did the drug get through and did the drug do what it’s supposed to do,” explained Dr. Sanai, the Brain Tumor Center’s Medical Director.\nDoctors know if there’s a drug response within seven to ten days.\n“If they’re on the study and they actually graduate to the therapeutic dosing after surgery, they’re really doing so knowing that there’s some hard evidence connecting their tumor’s response to the drug,” said Dr. Sanai.\nNEW RESEARCH: Each of the study`s 20 patients had previously received the current FDA-approved standard of care,",
        "baseline": " including surgery to remove their brain tumors, followed by radiation treatment and TMZ. Each patient`s cancer had returned. Each was then given varying doses of AZD1775 at various times just prior to operations to remove tumors that had grown back. ‘The hope is that these drugs &mdash; AZD1775 and TMZ &mdash; could work in tandem to exploit a particular genetic vulnerability discovered by TGen in certain glioblastoma tumors,’ said Michael Berens, Ph.D., a TGen Deputy Director, a co-Director of TGen`s Early-Phase Clinical Trials Unit, and one of the study`s authors.\nLeslie is thankful for new hope.\nDr. Sanai says three trials for about 50 patients are complete. In two of them, doctors identified drugs that had an effect and will be studied further. The third didn’t work, but he says researchers still got good information by understanding how it failed.",

        "prompt": "It was all the way back in season one of The Vampire Diaries, of course. The show hasn’t worried about doing too much in a long time. It’s easier to name the tropes this show hasn’t used.\nSpeaking to EW, executive producer and showrunner Julie Plec said that the mother of Matt Donovan’s Zach Roerig, Kelly (played by Melinda Clark), was originally going to be revealed as a succubus. It was part of the show trying to figure out how many supernatural beings were too many. They drew the line at the succubus.",
        "baseline": "\nWe shot a great scene with her sucking the life out of somebody and hooking up with Damon and everything and then we thought, “Oh my god, where in the hell are we going to go with this? And if this is season 1 and we’re going down this road, then what other demons, etc. are we going to explore?” We got cold feet, rightfully so, and we pulled back on it and so we never actually followed through on the story.\nActually, that is plenty fair. You probably want to stick to fewer elements early on in a show—especially one as soapy as this one, where there was a lot to get through. This would have been a bit too much, probably. Plus, it’s always more fun to ramp it up over time so the audience can look back and go “Wait, how did we get here?” The Vampire Diaries is currently in its eighth and final season.",

        "prompt": "100 years after the Somme: \"We ain't a-marching\"\nI AM part of the first generation of our species in a thousand years that has never been asked by my government to kill people.\nAt 7.30 one century ago this morning, Britain launched the first of its many grand offensives of the Great War, aiming to dislodge German troops from a ridge line on the Somme.\nThe young men of Newfoundland were called on at 8.45 to reinforce the rest of their 87th Infantry Brigade, stuck on the wire in no-man's land. It was a blunder. German crossfire cut them to shreds, massacring rank upon rank even as they rose from their trenches.\nPrivate James McGrath, wounded in three places, was left in no man's land for 17 hours. Another 324 other men were left there, dead.\nNinety percent of the unit were hit; of all the regiments that went into battle that day, the Newfoundlanders suffered the second worst casualty rate.\nIt took 20 minutes to wipe out the Newfoundland Army. The local paper in Newfoundland advertised \"Extra: Lengthy Casualty Lists\" on July 5 but families were in the dark about their sons' fate for years to come.\nAnd the tiny country couldn't bear their loss; they lost so many young men the country agreed to be annexed by Canada a few years later. July 1 is Canada Day everywhere except Newfoundland, where the national holiday is not celebrated. Instead, today is Memorial Day.\nA total of 57,000 English speaking men were killed or wounded that day, a century ago, plus tens of thousands of Germans, French and colonial troops. The battle continued for five more months and the war for two more years.\nOne Australian, simply known as Tank Stand Tommy was deployed to the tiny fortification in Pozieres they called Gibraltar in the middle of July.\nIt's a ruin nowadays, but you get a sense of the scale of the place from the entrance, which is less than five foot high, concrete and incredibly claustrophobic. He'd have bent to walk under the tight ceilings, you'd imagine.\nOver the course of a week, the Germans dropped tens of thousands of tonnes of TNT on the town around him, killing or wounding 7000 Australians: a direct hit would have wrecked the place.\nThough he survived the fight, Tommy could never live indoors again. He died a broken man years later, frozen to death under a rural water tower, the town drunk. He was likely not given back pay he was owed and his pension was probably confiscated by the state. He was Indigenous, and no less a casualty than if he'd been shot.\nSergeant John Ryan, 47th Australian Infantry Battalion, was overrun by a huge German offensive at Dernancourt, outnumbered eight to one.\nHe left three young sons and a wife who allegedly fell apart at the news; his sister meanwhile sued for their custody and his pay. The news was false. He was in a prison camp in Bavaria. Even when it does not kill, war can tear families apart.\nMost were not even that lucky; his unit suffered 225% casualties over two years. That is, it was wiped out, replaced, wiped out and replaced.\nOther units lost many more. Three hundred thousand Australians went to France or Gallipoli. Half of them came home wounded, crippled, maimed, legless, armless, blind or insane. Sixty thousand never came home.\nThe Australian Army took the highest casualty rate of any in the entire war - except New Zealand's.\nThis wasn't even unusual, historically speaking. There was a terrible war before the Great one, and another after it. For millions of humans throughout history, war was their very first adult experience - straight from the farm or the school and marched directly into the phalanxes or the tercios or the battalions and were carried thence directly into coffins, never to grow old.\nMillions of virgins died or were killed before graduating school. Hundreds of millions of mothers, widows, sisters, brothers, sons and fathers waited for years to be told that the government regrets to inform you that your son has been blown into red mist for your country. Dulce et decorum est is an old lie, as old as civilisation.\nAnd yet they were willing to do this. It's something you read again and again in diaries and memoirs: willingness to risk or sacrifice life and limb to end their need to do so.\nAnd they have been, more or less successful: that sort of thing doesn't really happen these days. I, a 25 year old university graduate, am long overdue for the front line, and yet",
        "baseline": " I'll never go there, unless I choose to.\nSomething has changed about human institutions that these experiences, while not gone, are radically limited in a way they have never before been, to professional armies and the periphery of the globe. The last time two big powers fought it out ended in 1953.\nSo to me this anniversary of this now-unknown horror is a joyous one, a time for celebration. We have more or less slain the great dragon, the worst demons of our nature have been overcome by the angels of it.\nI see this as the great success of the 20th century, far greater than landing on the moon. It means I will never have a white unnamed grave and I will never not be grateful for that.\nToday is also a reminder of the duty of our generation to make sure they stay that way.\nCredits to Queensland Theatre Company for the Indigenous soldier's anecdote, and to Battle Scarred by Craig Deayton for the married man's.",

        "prompt": "NEW YORK (AP) — In filing for bankruptcy, Toys R Us joins a list of dozens of store chains that have done so already this year as online leader Amazon increasingly exerts its influence over a huge part of the retailing world.\nThe toy chain, hobbled by $5 billion in debt and more intense competition, filed for protection from its creditors ahead of the key holiday season. Like so many retailers that find it harder to co-exist with Amazon, analysts say Toys R Us needs to improve its online services and offering special experiences in the stores.\nFor Toys R Us, that might be game demonstrations or hosting birthday parties. It says it’ll keep its 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores open, and keep serving customers while in bankruptcy. Still, the chain faces hurdles — price is a big issue for shoppers, and Toys R Us acknowledges that it can’t compete there.\n“We will go to Toys R Us to check out the current toys, and while we are at the store, we will be looking up prices on the phone on Walmart.com and Amazon,” said Randy Watson of Fort Worth, Texas.\nHe used to pick up items at Toys R Us for his kids. But for his grandchildren, he uses the store to see what’s available and then shops elsewhere to get lower prices.\nThe bankruptcies of nearly three dozen retailers since the beginning of the year — many of them very small companies, but also well-known names like Payless Shoe Source, Gymboree Corp. and True Religion jeans — has resulted in job losses and store closings. Toys R Us didn’t say if it would trim its workforce of nearly 65,000 employees worldwide.\nCredit Suisse believes that there could be 8,640 store closings this year, which would surpass the 2008 peak of 6,200. In 2008, the number of bankruptcies was at a historic high of 569, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmazon, meanwhile, has been using its $99-a year-Prime Membership as a way to gain fierce shopper loyalty as it adds more perks like same-day delivery Amazon Now for a growing number of markets. It’s also making partnerships with brands like Sears and Kohl’s, and now has hundreds of Whole Foods stores that it could use as distribution points.\nToys R Us was a major force in toy retailing in the 1980s and early 1990s, and was one of the first of the “category killers” — retailers that focused on one merchandising category and offered low prices. That combination hurt mom-and pop shops that couldn’t compete on breadth of inventory or price.\nBut like its peers, the now-defunct Sports Authority, Borders and Circuit City, Toys R Us started losing shoppers to discounters like Walmart and Target, and then to Amazon.\nGlobalData Retail estimates that about 13.7 percent of toy sales were made online in 2016, up from 6.5 percent five years ago. And Toys R Us has also been hurt by children shifting to mobile devices as playthings.\nBut the toy industry still needs Toys R Us, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of the toy review website TTPM. He cites the fact that it sells toys all year, rather than just at the holidays, and has helped launch toy crazes such as ZhuZhu Pets during the downturn.\n“If toy companies lost Toys R Us, it would be a hardship for a lot of companies,” said Silver.\nToys R Us has also struggled with debt since private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005. The plan had been to take the company public, but that never happened because of its weak financial performance.\nWith such debt levels, Toys R Us has not had the financial flexibility to invest in its business. Marc Rosenberg, a toy marketing executive, said it hasn’t been aggressive about building its online business, and let those sales migrate to rivals.\nToys R Us said the bankruptcy proceedings are a way for it to work with its creditors on restructuring its debt and will give it greater financial flexibility.\nWhat shoppers find on the shelves might be a question. Lawyers for Toys R Us said in court Tuesday that within a week of a news story about the possibility of bankruptcy, nearly 40 percent of the company’s suppliers refused to ship products without cash on delivery. That accelerated the bankruptcy filing.\nJefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said she expects that Toys R Us suppliers will continue to shift some orders to other retailers. For most multinational toy suppliers, the Toys R Us business roughly accounted for 10 percent of total sales, she said.\nThe issue isn’t that people aren’t buying toys. U.S. toy sales rose 6 percent last year on top of a 7 percent increase in the prior year, says NPD Group Inc., a market research firm. That was the biggest increase since 1999 and was fueled by several blockbuster movies.\nBut for the first half of 2017, sales rose",
        "baseline": " 3 percent. That puts more pressure on the later part of the year, when most toy sales occur, for the industry to meet NPD’s estimate for a 4.5 percent annual increase. Lego is laying off 1,400 workers after saying profits and sales dropped in the first half. And the nation’s two largest toy makers, Mattel and Hasbro, reported disappointing second-quarter results.\nToys R Us, based in Wayne, New Jersey, made its filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and said its Canadian subsidiary would seek similar protection through a court in Ontario. The company said separate operations outside the U.S. and Canada are not part of the filings and its online sales sites worldwide remain open for business.\nToys R Us said it expects to continue honoring return policies, warranties and gift cards, and customer loyalty programs.\nAssociated Press reporter Bill Cormier in Atlanta contributed to this report.",

        "prompt": "In 2010 the FSB adopted Principles for Reducing Reliance on Credit Rating Agency (CRA) Ratings. In 2012, the FSB set out a roadmap implement those principles and reduce mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings in standards, laws and regulations, which if implemented would remove mandatory use of credit ratings. The 2014 peer review of national authorities' implementation of the 2010 principles found that more could be done to address gaps in individual action plans.\nCRA assessments have a strong impact on asset allocation, such as for pension funds that have internal guidelines based on ratings. Because of this impact on demand, ratings also impact the interest rate borrowers pay for obtaining financing. Ratings are also written into certain prudential regulations. The Basel II framework hard-coded ratings into the capital requirements, while the Basel III framework allows banks to determine the risk weights for capital requirements on the basis of CRAs’ evaluations. Credit ratings are also used by central banks in the lending eligibility policies and foreign exchange reserves management, and provide a guideline for investment funds’ strategies. As part of efforts to implement the 2010 principles, In the United States, for example, financial regulators replaced mandatory use of credit ratings with alternative approaches that include the use of definitions, regulatory models, and evaluation by third parties, but as noted above, CRA ratings are still allowed to be used by banks in their internal risk models.\nThe FSB has no plans to conduct additional peer reviews of CRAs. Going forward national level reviews will be the main follow-up. The December 2015 report by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which annually assesses CRAs, covered the 2014 activities of the CRAs, found that one larger agency as well as some smaller ones did not have sufficient policies, procedures, and controls to manage the issuer-paid conflict or to prevent analytical personnel’s access to fee or market-share information.

A second step would be the analysis of how companies’ actions impact sustainable development, e.g. through carbon emissions, pollution, or through positive impacts. This would complement the above agreement, which focuses on analysing risks from these factors to companies’ businesses, but does not incorporate analysis of the impact of company actions. The impact of companies on sustainable development is also covered in the cluster on policies and regulatory frameworks in the chapter on private business and finance.",

        "prompt": "How are the Patriots and Falcons preparing differently?\nEntering Super Bowl week, plenty of attention will be thrust on Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons' unstoppable offense. Offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan thinks it's ridiculous that some are discounting the Patriots' No. 1 scoring defense.\n\"That blows my mind that people would be doing that,'' Shanahan said, via ESPN's Vaughn McClure. \"It's the best defense that we've seen in the NFL this year. The numbers show it. And watch the film and you see exactly why their numbers are the way they are. They are extremely tough to score against. That's why their No. 1 in the NFL. I believe only one game this year someone scored 30 points.\nCan the Patriots exploit the Falcons' zone defense?\nThe Patriots own the NFL's top scoring defense at 15.6 points per game allowed while ranking eighth in yards surrendered per game at 326.4. Bill Belichick's teams have only had the No. 1 scoring defense one other time in franchise history (2003), culminating that season with a Super Bowl win.\nIn the Belichick era (since 2000), the Patriots have won the Super Bowl in three of the four seasons in which they allowed 17.0 PPG",
        "baseline": " or less, per NFL Research.\nSince 1990, teams entering the Super Bowl with the No. 1 scoring defense are 7-2. The last time: the 2014 Seattle Seahawks, which lost to Tom Brady and the Patriots.\nThe reason some are discounting the Patriots' defensive statistics is due to a cavalcade of sub-par quarterbacks faced during the season. New England went against three top-10 offenses during the 2016 regular season -- Arizona, Pittsburgh and Buffalo (twice) -- allowing 19.5 PPG in those contests.\nShanahan and the Falcons' offense faced three top-10 scoring defenses in the regular season, averaging 25 points per game, per ESPN.\nThe Falcons' offense has been unstoppable this year, scoring 30-plus points in each of its last six games and averaging 40.0 PPG during the playoffs.\nShanahan won't say it, but it'd be a shock if Super Bowl LI weren't a high-scoring affair.",

        "prompt": "After years in the making, the village's conversion to city water should take place sometime next year.\nCOSHOCTON - The Coshocton city and the Village of West Lafayette councils have approved a deal for the city to sell water and water services to the village.\nCoshocton City Council members voted 5 to 0 in approving the agreement. Councilman Roger Moore was absent, but had previously expressed his support for the project. Councilman Tom Grier also voiced his support, but abstained from voting as he was the village administrator for West Lafayette when talks first began a couple years ago. Voting yes were Mike Gross, Chad Johnson, Jackie Salmans, Brad Fuller and Glenn Mishler.\nWest Lafayette Council approved the contract by a vote of 4 to 3 with Mayor Stephen Bordenkircher casting the tie breaking vote. Ron Lusk, Craig Bordenkircher and Christie Maurer voted for the deal. Timothy Cheney, Charles Wheeler and Bo Fortune voted against it. Those voting to the negative have long said they were against the village giving up direct rights to its water utility. Those who have supported it have long said it would offer better quality water at a cheaper rate to customers while providing loan and grant funding for needed infrastructure improvements.\nThe tentative schedule is for all funding applications and engineer drawings to be finalized by end of the year. Groundbreaking for the project would be early next year and conversion to city water for the village to take place later in 2020. An exact date has not been set.\nThe project will have the city running waterlines to the village and tie into existing infrastructure. Coshocton would then provide water and maintain services for the village's approximate 900 customers. The total project is estimated at $6.6 million. The city would not start receiving fees from customers until it starts providing the water.\nThe contract has the city taking ownership of the village water system, not including the wellfields. Items include underground pipes, hydrants, valves, meters and other appurtenances, water treatment plant, equipment, water storage facilities and associated real estate interests. The village would abandon its wellfield as it would no longer be needed.\nAbout 22,000 feet of 12-inch waterlines will connect the city water system to the village water treatment plant. Additionally, the project will see 13,000 feet of substandard waterlines replaced inside the village and extending up to 10,600 feet of 6-inch and 8-inch diameter waterlines to select areas of the village.\nVillage water users will not be subject to the current debt reduction charge city water customers have on their bills of $9.75 per month. Village residents will receive the inside city rate and outside the village customers will receive the outside city rate. Currently, the inside rate is $16.79 per month for a minimum user and the outside rate is 1.5 times that. The rate could go up by the time of activation, but the contract states there will be no rate increase for village water customers within the first 12 months after services from the city starts. The city will be responsible for invoicing and collecting fees.\nThe contract establishes the creation of an advisory committee to advise the city regarding water system improvements and rates. It will be comprised of the village administrator, a member of village council, a member of the Lafayette Township and Tuscarawas Township trustees, the city utilities director and a person appointed by the city mayor.\nThe city has recently completed a waterline expansion to Hillsdale Drive and is working on another along County Road 10. The city is positioning itself as a regional water authority. City council at its last meeting also had first reading of legislation establishing the salary for two new utility superintendent positions, one",
        "baseline": " at the water treatment plant and the other at the wastewater treatment plant. Council was also given job descriptions for the positions.\nIf approved, annual salaries would be $58,000 for 2019 for both jobs. Those would go up to $59,412 in 2020 and $60,936 in 2021, reflecting 2.5 percent increases per year for non-bargaining positions already approved by council. City Safety Services Director Max Crown said they hope to hire from within and the employees would need a Class III operators license. The alteration to the pay ordinance to add the positions is expected to go a full three readings at separate meetings before a vote.\nUtilities Director Dave McVay said the superintendents were needed based on new Ohio Environmental Protection Agency guidelines and the city's expanding water business stretching him thin.

        "prompt": "Slashing $100 billion: What's first to go?\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Incoming House Speaker John Boehner has made it very clear: When he takes control of the House, slashing the federal budget by $100 billion will be priority number one.\nRepublicans view their midterm electoral victory as a mandate to cut spending, and cutting $100 billion from a $3 trillion federal budget sounds like a reasonable goal.\nBut GOP leaders say they will focus only on non-security discretionary spending, and won't slash funding for defense, Social Security or Medicare.\nThat makes their task a lot harder.\nCutting non-security discretionary funds by $100 billion means a 21% annual reduction in the part of the budget that includes funding for education, health and human services and housing and urban development, among other things, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\nIn other words, the sacred cows of domestic Democratic policy.\nAsked which programs will be cut to get to the $100 billion target, Boehner did not offer specifics.\n\"But I will tell you,\" he told reporters earlier this month. \"We are going to cut spending.\"\nRepublicans point out they have already voted to ban earmarks -- money appropriated by a member of Congress for a special project -- within their own caucus.\nThe problem is that earmarks aren't additional spending -- they're a portion of the total amount lawmakers have agreed to spend for a given year.\nStill, Boehner already has his starting point picked out: reducing Congress' own budget.\n\"We'll start first by cutting our own budget. It will be one of our first votes,\" Boehner said earlier this month. But the savings available there are paltry. The total budget for the legislative branch was $4.7 billion in 2009.\nThat leaves the GOP with a lot of ground to make up.\nRepublicans offered some clues as to how they might cut discretionary spending in the party's Pledge to America document and the YouCut program introduced earlier this year.\nThe Pledge to America is short on specifics. Among its proposals: cap discretionary spending, freeze hiring of federal workers and cancel unspent stimulus funds.\n\"I think getting control of the discretionary accounts is a great first step,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a leading Republican economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe YouCut program actually put some GOP ideas to the test. During the last Congress, Republicans took 14 ideas to cut the budget and brought the items to a vote in the House. If they had all passed, more than $120 billion would have been cut from the budget.\nProblem: Not one measure passed.\nIt's unclear how much easier it will get. In 2011, Republicans will control the House, but they will still face a slight Democratic majority in the Senate and, of course, Obama in the White House.\n\"The president is still the one setting the agenda,\" said Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum.\nBoehner wants to start cutting right away, saying that Republicans want to roll back discretionary spending to 2008 levels as \"soon as possible.\"\nDemocrats, knowing the fight was ahead, tried",
        "baseline": " to nail down funding through October 2011.\nIn the last days of the current Congress, Democrats pushed for a massive $1.1 trillion budget extension that would have locked in spending at current levels for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.\nBut Senate Republicans killed the measure, instead forcing Democrats to settle for an extension that will keep spending at current levels until March 4.\nThat sets up a battle royale for early next year as Republicans seek to kill signature Democratic legislative victories, some of which -- like funding for health care and financial reform -- remain unfunded.\nHoltz-Eakin thinks the most likely scenario is that Congress will pass another short-term fix that will fund the government until October, and that the real fight will be over the 2012 budget.\n\"There will be some cuts [in fiscal 2011] and then they will turn to 2012, and that's where the rubber hits the road,\" Holtz-Eakin said.",

        "prompt": "A new scientific report supports the theory that the 1692 witch trials in Salem, Mass., may have followed the widespread consumption of a poisonous fungus similar to lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD.\nNineteen women and men were hanged as witches after they, or children in their presence, acted as if ''Satan were loosed in Salem,'' according to descriptions by colonists at the time.\nA report in the current issue of American Scientist suggests that the aberrant behavior of the adults and children, which included convulsions and hallucinations, probably was brought on by ergot, a fungus that grows on rye in cool, damp weather.\nWhen eaten, the fungus can cause symptoms, especially in children, that are said to resemble behavior that the early colonists attributed to witchcraft.\nThe ergot theory was first suggested six years ago in an article in the journal Science. But soon after the Science article was published, a long analysis in the same journal dismissed the explanation as improbable.\nIn the latest report, a historian, Mary K. Matossian, an associate professor at the University of Maryland, concludes that the original proposal was probably correct. Dr. Matossian, who has been studying the effects of mold poisoning on social behavior, based her report on an analysis of court transcripts, climate indicators, diaries and other records of the 1692 witchcraft episodes in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\nDr. Matossian writes that the trials of 1692 were ''the worst outbreak of witch persecution in American history.'' When Governor Phips of Massachusetts ordered a general reprieve the following spring, about 150 accused witches were released.\nThe idea that ergot was to blame was originally proposed by Linda R. Caporael, a graduate student in psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She argued that symptoms displayed by the children thought to be bewitched - fits and complaints of being pricked or bitten, for example -were typical of ergotism.\nThe rebuttal, by Nicholas P. Spanos and Jack Gottlieb, psychologists at Carleton University in Ottawa, noted that the children did not report some symptoms typical of ergot poisoning. Among them were nausea and vomiting, followed by ravenous hunger.\nThe witchcraft affair, she adds, ''may have been part of a largely unrecognized American health problem.'' Occasional cold, damp periods in coastal lowlands, she believes, allowed rye to become infected with ergot.\nAmong the symptoms of severe ergotism is ''formication,'' a feeling that ants are crawling under the skin. The victim may also suffer coldness of the extremities and spasms of limbs, tongue and facial muscles. In severe cases, epileptic seizures, partial paralysis and coma are followed by death.\n''Animals suffering from convulsive ergotism may behave wildly, make loud,",
        "baseline": " distressed noises, stop lactating, and die,'' Dr. Matossian wrote. Several cows and three people died during the 1692 outbreak.\nIn Salem and other towns of Essex County in Massachusetts, 24 of 30 purported victims of bewitchment in 1692 ''suffered from convulsions and the sensations of being pinched, pricked or bitten,'' she said. They may not have reported other symptoms such as nausea because those were not expected in witchcraft victims.\nIn the American colonies at that time, according to Dr. Matossian, rye bread was still a dietary staple and the crop was vulnerable to ergot. From widths of tree rings formed during that period, she found, the growing season in eastern New England was abnormally cool in 1690, 1691 and 1692.\nDiaries kept in Boston during the intervening winters showed they were ''very cold.'' The households chiefly stricken by the ''bewitchment'' were those closest to marshy land.",

' ' The symptoms of ergotism,she adds, ' ' are similar to those of the bewitched witches in Salem and in other witchcraft cases in New England and Connecticut,'. ' ' Dr.Matossian says that the ergot theory is supported by the fact that the Salem witchcraft trials began in the spring of 1662',when the weather was cold and damp.The witchcraft trials ended in the fall of 1663',when the weather became warmer and drier.''

' ' The ergot theory is not the only explanation for the Salem witchcraft trials.Some historians have suggested that the trials were a symptom of the political and economic turmoil of the time.Others have suggested that the accused witches were simply scapegoats for the misfortunes of the time.''

At issue were some potential factual errors Dobbs may in overstating the number of recent leprosy infections-and their connection to immigration.\nThe 7,000 cases figure appears likely to be a lower bound.\nFrom Sharon Lerner at the New York Times: \"While there were some 900 recorded cases in the United States 40 years ago, today more than 7,000 people have leprosy, or Hansen's disease, as it is now called. ''And those are the ones we know about,'' said Dr. William Levis, attending physician at Bellevue Hospital's Hansen's Disease Clinic. ''There are probably many, many more.''\"\nFurther in that article: \"Most of those infected in this country are immigrants from global leprosy hot spots, like Brazil, India and the Caribbean.\nBut, in the past six years, Dr. Levis and his colleagues have proved that a handful of his patients — including a 73-year-old man from Queens who had never been out of the country and an elderly Jewish man from Westchester — have contracted leprosy here.\"\nIs Dobbs biased? Perhaps, but major media sources are strongly biased in the opposite direction-selectively forgiving the mistakes of those that accept their agenda.\nMuch of that bias is related to their dependency on advertising revenue from major corporations-that are run by wealthy interests that tend to favor immigration.\nI doubt CNN put Dobbs on the air with his message until they didn't think they could avoid doing so without loosing credibility. Is Dobbs' overall journalistic credibility different than the comparable media? Sadly, US media is in very bad state.\nSadly, Katrina Vanden Heuvel's essay is politically biased reporting using a dubious source.\nThe SPLC is little more a \"Civil Rights Organization\" than the the Bakker's",
        "baseline": " PTL was a legitimate religious organization. Both of these dubious organizations greatly over spent on fund raising and executive salaries/perks.\nThe issue of human migration and infectious diseases is an important, politically charged issue. Is it really possible for conventional academic institutions to really look at this accurately? If not what are the costs/risks involved?\nJournalists should be to try to create an environment in which hard-nosed accuracy on these issues is fostered and encouraged, and the overall quality of journalism is increased. Vanden Heuvel must also take it upon herself to identify fringe sources she uses-particularly in dealing with an issue in which wealthy interests are so heavily involved as immigration. It is relatively easy to find \"legitimate\" sources that cheer lead for the wealthy-and those that do not may have issues from sheer lack of resources. We must learn look at what the truth would be like without this bias-in an environment in which hard facts are hard to come by.",

There were claims security guards had tried to stop people leaving as they underestimated the severity of the fire.\nThe band performing at the venue had lit a flare, police said, which set the soundproofing foam on the ceiling alight, spreading in seconds.\nWitnesses said there was a stampede of people trying to reach one exit of the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, a university city in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Many of those who survived had been in the VIP section closest to the door.\nMajor Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who was leading rescue efforts for the military police, said there were up to 500 people inside the club when the fire broke out at about 230am local time.\nSanta Maria fire chief Guido de Melo said there had been widespread panic after the fire broke out. \"The main cause of death was asphyxiation,\" he said.\nAccording to local reports, the event at the venue with a capacity for 2,000 people was a £5 per person festival for students at the Federal University of Santa Maria.\nMatheus Bortolotto, a dentist who survived the fire, said some of the victims had been trapped by crowd control barriers.\n\"The club's barriers used to organise queues locked people in,\" he told Correio do Povo. \"One girl died in my arms, I felt her heart stop beating. It was like a movie scene.\n\"The ambulances could not cope with the number of casualties. We could not manage to use the emergency exits. Those at the bottom of the club had no chance.\"\nHe said the flare had been set off by the band, Gurizada Fandangueira, during the first song but the crowd only reacted when they saw black smoke coming from the stage.\nMichele Pereira, another survivor: \"The band that was onstage began to use flares and, suddenly, they stopped the show and pointed them upward. At that point the ceiling caught fire. It was really weak but in a matter of seconds it spread.\"\nMurilo de Toledo Tiecher, a medical student, claimed security guards did not realise the gravity of the fire and initially tried to stop people leaving.\n\"People were screaming 'there's a fire' but the security guards didn't budge and tried to keep the door shut,\" he told Zero Hora newspaper.\n\"Five or six people knocked over one security guard and knocked down the door. It was the only exit.\n\"The first people to get out tried to pull out whoever was still inside. Hands and arms appeared from the curtain of smoke.\n\"I pulled out a girl by the hair. It was chaos.\"\nLuana Santos Silva, 23, told GloboNews that she was near the exit when the fire started. \"We looked at the ceiling at the front of the stage and saw a fire was starting,\" she said. \"My sister grabbed me and dragged me across the floor. It was a small emergency door for so many people.\"\nHer sister Aline, 29, added: \"The smoke spread very fast, it did not give people time to escape.\n\"People started to get sick and soon people were leaving covered in soot.\"\nSome of the bodies of the victims were taken to a nearby municipal sports centre where families gathered to identify the dead. Authorities are reportedly struggling to identify some of the female victims, who became separated from their handbags in the club.\nBrazilian press on Sunday night reported that most of the victims were aged between 16 and 20, despite the event being for over 18s, as many teenagers are thought to have attended with fake ID cards.\nAt least six hospitals received the injured while health workers appealed for blood donations and medical supplies. The city, which is 180 miles from the state capital Porto Alegre, has a population of around 250,000.\nNews of the death toll prompted President Dilma Rousseff to cut short her visit to Chile to return to Brazil.\nShe was taking part in a summit between the 27-member European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, known as C",

        "prompt": "Despite Gov. Ned Lamont's surprise suggestion two weeks ago, that MGM and the Mohegans and Mashantucket Pequots might come to agreement about the future of Connecticut gambling, the prospects of such a deal seem dimmer than ever.\nI'll give the benefit of the doubt to the governor, who said give him a few weeks to see if he might be able to announce a tribal–MGM deal.\nMaybe it's the passing of two weeks already, or maybe the news story last week that MGM has pushed Foxwoods out of its prime advertising billboard perch at Fenway Park, but I am feeling more confident than ever that there's no bringing the Vegas giant together with the Connecticut tribes for a deal that would amicably carve up the gambling pie here.\nIt's too bad, because I liked the idea that maybe the tribes, if allowed to build their East Windsor casino, would allow a commercial casino in Bridgeport that would release them from paying the state 25 percent of the reservation slot machine revenues.\nThat might be a good bargain for eastern Connecticut, if tax-free casinos here are healthy.\nIndeed, it looks to me, after a visit to MGM Springfield, that no-tax tribal casinos in eastern Connecticut might compete pretty well with a taxpaying MGM casino in Bridgeport.\nThe Springfield casino is a yawner. Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are, in comparison, spectacular in every way.\nMind you I am not a casino player, and I assume that the gambling experience, time at the tables or working slot machines, is pretty comparable at all three casinos.\nBut in most other respects — dining, entertainment and shopping opportunities — the reservation casinos are remarkably more interesting. They are true destination resorts.\nFor a wow factor, for instance, it's hard to compare the experience of handing your car over to a valet parker in the big concourse at Foxwoods Grand Pequot Tower, drifting through the immense, grandly decorated hotel lobby and ascending by fast elevator to the 24th floor, where you can dine sumptuously with views across the rolling hills of eastern Connecticut.\nMGM Springfield has a food court and a few pretty ordinary, overpriced restaurants.\nReservation casinos: A golf course, an enormous sports arena, performance theaters, zip line, bumper cars, bowling alleys, swimming pools, dozens of restaurants and bars, buffets, a brew pub, a huge shopping mall, comedy clubs, sculptures by famous artists, waterfalls, fountains and hotel towers with spectacular room views.\nMGM Springfield: A seven-screen Regal movie complex.\nI can't emphasize enough at how underwhelmed I was by the inside of MGM Springfield. You could literally be inside a casino in anywhere USA.\nI suppose a lot of the close to $1 billion it cost was spent on blending it in with the Springfield streetscape. This was indeed done masterfully, and the city-facing facades are beautiful and very convincing, like they are part of the original fabric of the old city.\nThe problem with integrating this new casino with the neighborhood around it, though, is that many of the surrounding buildings are empty and run down. The elegant casino facades almost mock the extensive blight that stares back.\nIt's like showing up in a dive bar wearing a tuxedo.\nThe concept, a new and interesting one in casino design, was that there would be a natural flow between the city and the casino, that stores and restaurants of the casino would face the street, drawing in city passers-by, and casinogoers would drift outside to the sidewalks and merge into the urban experience.\nIt's not working, at least not yet. The people I saw trudging by on their way to the bus stop didn't seem interested in the posted menu for the casino steakhouse, with entrée prices breaking the $30 mark.

People go to a dealer, see a black Continental GT with most of the options they want and decide \"that'll do.\" It seems hard to believe that a multi-millionaire that can be so discerning in all the other parts of their life would just settle when it comes to a car.\nSo Bentley is taking a page out of the rest of the world's book and pushing it's bespoke program here in the US. And there's really no reason not to do it, unless you need a Bentley RIGHT NOW.\nWhat bespoke does is tailor the car to your exact taste. In the case of this Bentley Flying Spur, it has an outrageous blue called Kingfisher on the outside, which isn't close to subtle. Inside there are two hides (colors of leather, to you non-patricians), one called Portland and the other called Porpoise. It has 21 inch wheels, red calipers, special wood, and more.\nThe look is, in short, \"the business.\"\nAnd as a chauffeured car for a bachelor, it rocks. The interior is subdued but the exterior color is outrageous. Everywhere we went we had people asking if it was our car and what it was. We also had people glaring at a bunch of 20-somethings getting out of a bright blue Bentley, wondering what they'd done so wrong in life/what we've done so right.\nThere also is no better way to transport a hungover groom-to-be than in the backseat of a quiet, comfortable, opulent, and rich Bentley. Mainly because he can nurse that hangover by controlling the radio, cooling his seats, getting a massage, and acting like the member of the aristocracy that he isn't. After what we made him drink that night (photos were not taken for a reason), the least we could do was politely coddle him the next morning.\nWhat isn't bespoke is the powerplant, which is still the 616 horsepower W12, an engine that is smooth and silky, but not nearly as evocative or fun as the V8 power that is now offered in the Continental and Flying Spur. But the engine isn't supposed to be in the foreground of the W12 powered offerings,",
        "baseline": " it's there to provide thrust without intrusion.\nSame can be said for the suspension. There are four setting for the damping, but I didn't even switch from the softest setting the entire time. This was for comfort, not a blast to parliament for an emergency meeting with the Prime Minister in the back seat. We had no use for handling. We wanted to be coddled, to relax off the mix of liquor or beer that was go juice in college but a death sentence just a little bit later in life.\nWas it the perfect car for the trip? Pretty much. Would it have been better in a more boring color? Not really. In a world where Bentley's are becoming more common, do you really want to come across one that's exactly the same as yours?\nNo. You want to be the only person with that car. And the electric blue here was called loud and odd, but nobody ever said it was boring. That's what you want.",

        "prompt": "Sidhu was sentenced to eight years in prison today, for his part in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash in April of last year.\nThe truck driver who caused the deadly Humboldt Broncos bus crash a year ago was sentenced to eight years in prison Friday in a Melfort, Sask., court.\nJaskirat Singh Sidhu, 30, pleaded guilty in January to 29 counts of dangerous driving causing death or bodily injury. Sidhu lived in Calgary and was working for a Calgary-based trucking company at the time of the crash.\nJudge Inez Cardinal expressed empathy for the victims' families as she read out her sentencing decision.\nI approach this matter with the recognition that no sentence I impose will make the victims or families whole again or ease the suffering they endure. Nothing can turn back the clock and return the victims, the families, or Mr. Sidhu to the place they were before this tragedy unfolded.\nThis collision was avoidable. Jaskirat Singh Sidhu was solely responsible for this collision as evidenced by the forensic accident report. He missed key indicators of an approaching intersection, and his prolonged inattention resulted in the deaths of sixteen people and caused bodily harm to thirteen others.\nI accept that Mr. Sidhu did not deliberately drive through the intersection in the sense that he was trying to meet a deadline or that he was running late. However, the focus cannot simply be upon what occurred at the intersection. I must consider everything that led up to his driving through the intersection and the resulting catastrophic collision.\nAs he approached the intersection, Mr. Sidhu had a clear view of the scene in front of him. Nothing was blocking his view as the trees in the south-east quadrant were not an issue. However, he failed to take note of the approaching intersection, the approaching bus, or the five signs indicating an intersection with a stop sign was ahead. Had he done so, he should have made the conscious decision to start adjusting his driving so as to do what was required in the immediate future - to bring his large, heavy rig to a complete stop at the intersection.\nDespite its large size and weight, the semi-tractor and trailers could be brought to a stop in a short distance. Calculations were done to determine the \"distance to skid\" in a panic braking situation, based on the perception-reaction time of 1.5 seconds for a sober, rested driver (Report, page 44). This showed that at 86 km/h Mr. Sidhu could have stopped his rig in 99.61 meters. At 96 km/h, in a panic braking situation, the unit could have been brought to a stop in 119.10 meters.\nUsing these calculations, and as illustrated by the chart at page 43 of the Report, Mr. Sidhu had ample time to react - over 400 meters and nearly 15 to 17 seconds – as he approached the intersection, had he been paying attention. As noted at page 44 of the Report, had he been travelling at 86 km/h, and only noticed the sign \"Highway 35 South/Highway 335 West/Highway 35 North\" immediately before the stop sign, and reacted by making a threshold braking application, the collision would not have occurred. This fourth sign was 104.3 meters east of the stop sign so the semi would have skidded to a stop before reaching the stop sign. Even if the semi was traveling at a speed of 96 km/h, it would have skidded past the stop sign, and the impact would have been narrowly, but completely, avoided.\nThe semi-tractor unit with its \"Super B\" configuration was a huge, heavy, and deadly vehicle. It was made even more so by an inexperienced operator in unfamiliar territory who was not giving his full attention to the road ahead of him. He continued past the stop sign without any attempt at braking or evasive action. His large unit straddled both lanes of the highway and left no avenue of escape for the bus.\nIt is baffling, and incomprehensible, that a professional driver, even one with little experience, could miss so many markers over such a long distance. His inattention displays risky behaviour given he saw the signs but they did not register because he continued to focus on the trailers behind him.\nI find Mr. Sidhu's moral blameworthiness to be high, especially considering his prolonged inattentiveness while operating a large, loaded semi and the tragic consequences that flowed from his actions. These offences require a strong message of deterrence and denunciation be sent to ensure Mr. Sidhu never operates a vehicle in such a dangerous manner, and that others, especially operators of large vehicles, understand that the dangerous operation of a motor vehicle will result in lengthy sentences of imprisonment.\nSomehow we must stop this carnage on our highways. It should not take an event such as this to make people realize that operating a motor vehicle requires the full attention of the driver. Stop signs must be obeyed and everyone, regardless of what type of motor vehicle they are operating, must come to a complete stop before proceeding. As is apparent in this case and the cases noted, seconds matter. Attention to the road matters.\nArriving at a just and appropriate sanction requires a balancing of the relevant principles of sentencing, keeping in mind the overall sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Having considered all of the sentencing principles outlined in the Code, the circumstances of the offence and the offender, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as well as other sentences given to other offenders in similar circumstances, I find that a significant period of incarceration is warranted.\nIf it can be said that there is a sentencing range outlined by the case law for these offences in Saskatchewan or Canada, based on the cases cited, then this case is clearly outside that range. The longest sentence handed down was in Saini, being six years' incarceration, after trial, where four died and nine were injured. Even taking into account Mr. Sidhu's guilty pleas, and even if it could be said his moral blameworthiness was less because his actions were not deliberate, a sentence of more than six years is mandated due to the horrific consequences of his actions.\nConcurrent sentences are appropriate, rather than consecutive, given the offences all arise from the same circumstances. The principles of totality and restraint also guide this decision. I prefer to assign a significant sentence and order all sentences concurrent to each other. If I were to order Mr. Sidhu to serve even short periods of incarceration consecutive to each other, it would not send the same message as a single, lengthy sentence, and would otherwise result in an unduly long and harsh sentence given the number of counts in the information.\nOn count one, dangerous driving causing death, I sentence Mr. Sidhu to eight years' incarceration. On each of counts 2 through 16, inclusive, the remaining counts of dangerous driving causing death, I impose sentences of eight years' incarceration, concurrent to count 1 and concurrent to each other.\nOn each of counts 17 through 29, inclusive, being the thirteen counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, I sentence Mr. Sidhu to five years' incarceration, concurrent to each other and concurrent to counts 1 through 16 inclusive.\nThere are ancillary orders in the Criminal Code that flow from a conviction for dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm. Driving prohibitions are discretionary orders for each offence in the information. Pursuant to s. 259(2)(b), I exercise my discretion and, on count 1 make an order prohibiting Mr. Sidhu from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place in Canada. This order starts today and is for a period of ten years plus any period to which he is sentenced to imprisonment.\nThese convictions are secondary designated offences for which an order for forensic DNA analysis may be made at the discretion of the sentencing judge. In exercising my discretion, I conclude it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to make an order considering the factors as contained within s. 487.051 (3) of the Criminal Code. These factors include the nature of the offences, the circumstances surrounding their commission and",

Therefore, on count 1, I make an order in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from Mr. Sidhu for the purpose of DNA analysis. I give the authorities 30 days from today to obtain those samples.\nIn addition, a firearms prohibition is mandatory pursuant to s. 109(1)(a) and 109(2) of the Code. On count 1, I make an order prohibiting Mr. Sidhu from possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, and any cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance during the period that begins today and ends ten years after his release from imprisonment. Further, I make an order prohibiting him from possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition for life.

Virtually every wall, central reservation and pillar has become a hanging space while large banners flutter from two bridges crossing the occupied thoroughfare.\nAll the while a team is on constant alert for any sign of an impending police crackdown.\nThe political, grassroots nature of the protest works are far removed from Hong Kong’s usual art scene, dominated by pieces that sell for record-breaking sums.\n“Everyone can see it, everyone can go, everyone can participate,” McGurgan says of the impromptu outdoor art venue.\nBut activists are acutely aware it could all be lost if the police attack.\nMuch of the art at a secondary protest site in the working-class neighbourhood of Mongkok was destroyed in recent clashes with officers.\nNumerous artists have already given their permission for volunteers to remove the pieces at the main site. But finding a place to store them has been more problematic, with the city’s museums balking at taking the works.\nAbout a dozen galleries have stepped in to fill the void, offering to store the pieces safely until more permanent plans can be made. Trucks have also been donated and are ready to remove the pieces should police move in, she said.\nFor pieces such as “Umbrella Man” that task will hopefully be relatively simple: get in, grab the statue, and get out.\nFor the “Lennon Wall”, however – an emotive stretch of wall covered with thousands of sticky notes inscribed with messages from both supporters and detractors of the movement – the task is more complex.\n“We’ve taken large-scale photographs from far away and gridded them off into sections,” McGurgan says of the fragile pink and yellow mosaic.\nIf the situation becomes too dangerous to remove the art safely, she adds, UMAP’s volunteers will do their best to document “the destruction of something beautiful”.\nThat material would then be added to a digital archive that UMAP is also building, potentially even using it to recreate any pieces that might be destroyed.\nIt’s not just the art that activists are struggling to preserve.\nThe Umbrella Movement Visual Archive and Research Collective, another organisation coordinating with UMAP, is working with volunteers to document “how people form a community here, and how they transform the space”, says one of its founders Sampson Wong.\nThat includes everything from street signs that have been altered to show pro-democracy slogans or poke fun at",
        "baseline": " politicians, to the living spaces that protesters are creating at the site.\n“Basically you have all parts of life in place here in a different way,” Wong says.\nThe group aims to launch a website archiving the material and an interactive map of the site using crowd-sourced images and stories, Wong said.\nLike UMAP, Wong’s group has people standing by should chaos break out to retrieve the smaller, more ordinary things that help make up the site.\n“But obviously once the objects are taken away from here they are decontextualised, they are leaving their context, so we very much don’t want to do that until the last moment,” he said.\nLocal artist Kacey Wong says the democracy movement’s protest art needs to be preserved for future generations.\n“I don’t know what is the future of Hong Kong but right now it looks grim,” he says.",

        "prompt": "If the fossil Lucy, the most famous woman from out of the deep human past, had a child, it might have looked a lot like the bundle of skull and bones uncovered by scientists digging in the badlands of Ethiopia.\nThe paleontologists who are announcing the discovery in the journal Nature today said the 3.3-million-year-old fossils were of the earliest well-preserved child ever found in the human lineage. It was estimated to be about 3 years old at death, probably female and a member of the Australopithecus afarensis species, the same as Lucy’s.\nAn analysis of the skeleton revealed evidence of a species in transition, the scientists said in interviews yesterday.\nThe lower limbs supported earlier findings that afarensis walked upright, like modern humans. But gorillalike arms and shoulders suggested that it possibly retained an ancestral ability to climb and swing through the trees.\n“Her completeness, antiquity and age at death make this find unprecedented in the history of paleoanthropology,” said Zeresenay Alemseged, the Ethiopian leader of the discovery team and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\nTwo reports of the findings are being published in Nature. The National Geographic Society, a supporter of the research, will run a popular article on the fossil child in the November issue of its magazine.\nAt a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the scientists gave the fossil the name Selam, which means peace in Ethiopia’s official Amharic language.\nScientists not involved in the research said the fossils were a significant find that should provide new insights about the afarensis species and a little-known period of early human origins.\n“The child really confirms that afarensis was walking upright,” said Tim D. White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It has the potential to answer old questions and raises some new ones” — including their behavior in trees. Dr. White, who has found even earlier human ancestors in Ethiopia, participated in the analysis of the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy fossils. They were uncovered not far away in Ethiopia in 1974 by Donald C. Johanson, who is now director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.\nOther discoveries show that the afarensis species, a major branch of the human family tree, lived in Africa from earlier than 3.7 million to 3 million years ago.\nDr. Wood, a paleoanthropologist, also noted how rare it was for the fragile bones of infants to survive long enough to fossilize. “But if they do, they provide precious evidence about the growth and development of the individual and the species,” he wrote.\nUntil now, Dr. Wood said, the earliest comparably complete specimen of a human-related child was that of a Neanderthal who lived less than 300,000 years ago in Syria.\nThe discovery team said the largely intact condition of the fossils indicated that the child was presumably buried in sand and rocks shortly after death during a flood in a desert region known today as Dikika, in northeastern Ethiopia.\nThen, in December 2000, along came a team of fossil hunters led by Dr. Alemseged. On a steep hillside, one of the men, Tilahun Gebreselassie of the Ethiopia Ministry of Culture and Tourism, was the first to see the child’s tiny face looking up from a block of sandstone. It was a long and projecting face with a flat nose.\nThe face and skull were clearly that of a young afarensis, the scientists concluded almost immediately.\nDr. Alemseged’s team spent much of the last five years extracting the rest of the specimen from the surrounding stone with dentist’s drills and picks. The tedious work exposed the full cranium and jaws, the torso and spinal column, limbs and the left foot. The child’s one complete finger was curled in a tiny grasp, much like a young chimpanzee’s. The skeleton is much more complete than Lucy’s.\nAlthough the fossils are still being studied, Dr. Alemseged and his colleagues noted several important findings and areas for further research",
        "baseline": ". The Dikika girl’s brain size, for example, was about the same as that of a similarly aged chimpanzee, but a comparison with adult afarensis skulls indicates a relatively slow brain growth slightly closer to that of humans.\nThe presence of a hyoid bone was a surprise. It is a rarely preserved bone in the larynx, or voice box, that supports muscles of the throat and tongue. The bone in the infant appeared to be primitive and more similar to those found in apes than in humans, the scientists said, but is the first hyoid found in such an early human-related species and thus important in research about the origins of human speech.\nThe first relatively complete shoulder blades to be found in an australopithecine individual was one of the most puzzling aspects of the discovery, several scientists said. The lower body appeared to be adapted for upright walking by afarensis. But the shoulders and long arms were more apelike.",

        "prompt": "What's behind the rise in c-sections?\nNurses face a particular burden of documentation because unlike most physicians—who are typically self-employed or employed by obstetrical practices—nurses are almost always employed by hospitals, and hospitals provide malpractice insurance for their employees. The hitch, however, is that hospitals will not cover a nurse in a malpractice claim if she did not document that protocols were followed. In fact, consistently breaking protocols is a cause for termination of employment. As nurse Michele Saxton tells me, “If you’re not keeping up on your reading and you’re not up on your standards of care and you don’t know the protocols, you’ll get yourself in trouble. They won’t protect you if you didn’t follow those procedural policies.” Thus nurses become the “enforcers” of protocols; the burden of “compliance” is placed on the least-powerful professional actors, a common practice in organizations. This burden was a common concern of nurses. Some may be surprised to hear that most nurses with whom I spoke are very critical of the way maternity care is being delivered, with a particular scorn toward interventions, such as routine inductions, use of Pitocin for labor acceleration, and, especially, nonmedically indicated c-sections. I think this would especially surprise many midwives, who often have a somewhat cynical view of nurses. Nurses are structurally placed in a situation where they must enforce protocols and document that those protocols have been followed.\nI thought it might interest you to know that I am going to a full-day seminar entitled: “Advanced Fetal Monitoring 2007 and Legal Implications.” There’s no mistaking what this course is about. One of the lectures is titled: “Monitoring for Asphyxia: What You Need to Know and Document.” The reality of the event is the same, but how you document it (and therefore how it’s presented to a jury) is what counts. I think about law all day long.\nConferences spread documentation as the answer to liability threat and also perpetuate a focus on law among maternity providers.\nOne can see how, put in such a position, maternity providers may focus too much on how attorneys will perceive their actions. For example, physician Philip Burgin tells me, “[I think], ‘This wouldn’t have been a shoulder dystocia if you hadn’t delivered that head.’ Because the question posed to a doctor [is], ‘If you’d done a c-section, would this baby be paralyzed now?’ I hear lawyers talking in my head all the time.” It is clear that Doctor Burgin thinks about liability and how attorneys will interpret his actions constantly, likely obsessively.\nYou watch how the physicians are practicing now, and because of malpractice and things that have happened in our own state. . . . Doctors [who] I have worked with for fourteen years, who we call the men and women with “all the feel,” they would watch a strip [with] variables and decels, and they’d [say], “Let’s try this, let’s try that—change position, use amnioinfusion, give herb tea,” whatever. . . . Let’s just say there were five things that you could do when a strip looked bad. Now they are trying one or two things, and if it’s not immediately better, we go down the hall for a c-section.\nPerhaps the most shocking story I heard comes from physician Joe Haley, the mild-mannered, friendly obstetrician who bought me coffee. He lowers his eyes and speaks quietly when he says, “I call my wife when I’m hanging out in labor and delivery, and I say, ‘Oh, the strip looks like this,’ and she says, ‘Just do a section.’ [I feel threatened], and in a serious way, because . . . I mean, she’s not a doctor. But you really are vulnerable, and there’s really no protection.” This is perhaps the most telling example of the fear maternity providers face in modern maternity care. Asking one’s nonphysician spouse for advice on how to manage a woman’s labor seems unbelievable, but it does happen, perhaps in this case as a way Doctor Haley manages his stress and anxiety over caring for women with complicated deliveries.\nMaternity providers feel caught in a bind. The defined way to escape being held accountable for unpreventable negative birth outcomes is to perform a c-section. Then, if a bad outcome happens, they are less likely to be blamed—they did all they could. From the perspective of maternity providers, they are caught in the fundamental irrationality of organizational change. Organizations have defined c-sections as the answer to liability threat. This definition causes maternity providers to change their behavior and perform more c-sections because they fear if they do not they will be blamed for bad birth outcomes, even those outcomes that are not preventable or predictable. The current economic, political, and legal environment binds organizations, and organizations change to protect organizational interests. In this case, professional organizations, malpractice insurers, courts, and hospitals have coalesced in their suggestion that c-sections solve liability threats.\nCourts also enforce this view by focusing on the timing of the c-section. For example, physician Robert Hinson tells me, “When you get deposed in a malpractice lawsuit . . . you will be asked if you could have done the cesarean five or ten minutes earlier or done it an hour earlier . . . and could that have made the difference.” In short, what maternity providers tell me repeatedly is that the message they get from courts on how to prevent malpractice suits is to perform more c-sections and to perform them early. Surgical birth becomes the answer to preventing liability threats, even though there is little evidence that c-sections prevent most bad outcomes.\nI also commonly heard about the role of professional workshops and conferences. As I mentioned just a few pages ago, these workshops and conferences teach maternity providers the importance of documentation in preventing liability threats. However, the messages from these workshops and conferences go beyond documentation that protocols were diligently followed. Physicians talk about how these types of conferences affect how they assess risk in labor. Physician Philip Burgin speaks about a workshop he attended in which a prominent malpractice insurance plaintiffs’ attorney lectured: “One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers said something I [will] never [forget]: ‘OK, if you’re thinking about a c-section, you should be doing a c-section.’” Similarly, physician Lois Timberlake tells me of a lecture she attended at a professional conference: “There was one lecture I heard at a New England ob-gyn society meeting. . . . He started out as an obstetrician, and then he got his law degree, and he was very much, ‘When in doubt, section . . . don’t even think twice about it.’” In other words, attorneys spread fear of bad outcomes and c-section as an answer to this fear.\nLitigating attorneys also spread fear of liability by seeking potential clients through advertising on local radio and television stations. Physicians commonly spoke about litigation attorneys’ television commercials that target them for malpractice lawsuits. Physician Rosemary Steel tells me, “I’m sure you’ve seen those commercials with the lawyers saying, ‘Is your child not as smart as you think [she] should be? Maybe it was a birth injury. Why don’t you give us a call?’ I mean, those kinds of commercials, of course, drive me crazy because they’re picking on things that don’t even exist sometimes.” These types of media presentations are perceived as threatening to maternity providers.\nAre C-Sections Just More Convenient for Obstetricians?\nIt is important here to digress for just a moment to examine the idea that physicians perform c-sections out of convenience, something that is heard in everyday conversation. I argue that convenience should be understood within the organizational constraints physicians face. For example, physicians would likely rather do c-sections outside of office hours rather than attend vaginal births during office hours because they need to see patients to earn money to pay skyrocketing malpractice premiums. Most health insurance companies pay a global fee for birth. That means that health insurance companies pay the physician a single rate, usually between $2,500 and $3,500, for all prenatal visits and the birth. Physicians are not compensated for attending a long labor, and if a physician interrupts office hours to attend a birth, he or she will potentially lose money by not seeing scheduled patients. Remember, as malpractice insurance premiums escalate, obstetricians must see more and more patients just to cover that increased rate. Protecting office hours becomes a necessity. Further, although providers performing c-sections in the evening may seem to smack of convenience, it is also the case that evening c-sections allow providers not to miss any office hours and to sleep at night. Getting a good night’s sleep is in the interest of providers who, because of increasing malpractice insurance rates, feel a pressure to see patients as many days in the week as possible. Many maternity providers told me they often have a full slate of patients, even if they were on call the night before. Obstetricians also expressed concern about the safety of c-sections during the nighttime because everyone is likely to be more tired.\nIn other words, liability may underlie “convenience” because of the pressure to earn money to pay malpractice insurance premiums. It may be that some physicians are performing c-sections to go play golf or to go to dinner, but with most physicians operating in group practices, this is not as much of a concern as it used to be with solo practices. In short, organizational constraints are a better explanation of practices that seem to be convenient for physicians.\nSo why not? . . . We’re not stupid. You kick us long enough, we respond. Do we believe in it? No. Do I believe we’re doing far too many c-sections? Absolutely. But every once in a while, you’ll try to let someone labor longer, even if it’s unpredictable because nature’s unpredictable, shoulder events, something will happen, and we’ll get blamed for it. So until society decides it doesn’t want to put up with this anymore, we’re going to continue to move in this direction because that’s what society has asked us to do.\nOrganizations have responded to uncertain legal, political, and economic environments, and one response that has coalesced among organizations has been to define c-sections as the gold standard for a “safe” birth.\nStill, women do not commonly perceive that their births are being held in the hands of providers who feel backed into a corner. They trust their doctors and believe that if they recommend a c-section, it must be necessary. The Listening to Mothers II Survey found that, while 62 percent of women believe that the current malpractice system causes providers to take better care of their patients, well less than half believe that providers would perform an unnecessary c-section to avoid being sued. Trust in providers was",
        "baseline": " a common sentiment, here expressed in the words of Dianne, a thirty-four-year-old woman who delivered her second child by c-section after two hours of pushing failed to result in a vaginal birth: “I mean I’m happy. The baby is safe, and I’m OK. I was avoiding a c-section. . . . I had to go through all possible ways of having a vaginal delivery, but I still couldn’t get a vaginal delivery. Yeah, so it was a little disappointing, but at the end all that matters is a healthy baby and healthy me, of course. Right?” What would women like Dianne think if they knew how preoccupied their providers are with being blamed for a bad outcome? Would they so easily discount their desire for a vaginal birth?\nExcerpted from \"Cut It Out: The c-section epidemic in America\" by Theresa Morris. Copyright 2013. NYU Press. All rights reserved.",

His story provides a glimpse into the horror of what everyone faced, and also his will to save his neighbours. (Click here to view an Al Jazeera slideshow of more photos and stories from Santana do Munda?).\nWhen the river water levels first started to increase, nobody was particularly worried, Silva said.\n“When the river swelled, it used to bring us joy,” he told Al Jazeera from the town where he has lived all his life.\nBut at about 9am last Friday, things changed quickly.\n“When I saw that the water had reached the door of my house, I started to worry,\" Silva, 36, said.\nSilva lived in that house with his wife and children. When the water started to rise fast, she and the kids made their way to higher ground at the town elementary school, which is now serving as a shelter for a couple dozen homeless families.\nSilva decided to stay behind to see who needed help.\n“A kid was on his roof with his mother and father. The water had almost reached them,\" Silva told us.\n\"I helped them to safety, and held onto them as I swam and brought them to shore.\n“There were two other men trapped in a house, and they couldn’t get out.\nSilva rescued five people that day from raging waters. But he is still haunted by one man in town, named Gilmar, whom he could not save.\n“We were up on the hill around five o'clock and it was getting dark,” Silva recounts.\nThen",
        "baseline": ", the roof of the house Gilmar was standing on collapsed under the weight of the rushing waters.\n“When the house fell, someone saw him holding onto a rock,” Silva said.\nWhile Silva was unable to save Gilmar, the five people he did save are now grateful that the man would risk his own life to save others.\n“The woman I rescued - Nita is her name - when she saw me the other day she fainted,” Silva remembers.\n“I feel like a hero,” he admitted.\nHowever, now Silva is facing a battle of his own.\nHe and his family lost everything they owned in the floods, and are one of 40 families living in the local school and trying to live off of donations and figure out how to pick up the pieces of their lives.\nBut perhaps amid all the chaos of those horrific days of flooding, his quick actions make all the material loss slightly easier to bear.",

The AWD version loses 1 mpg on its high-speed rating, going from the front-drive model's 39 mpg highway to 38 mpg.\nChevrolet's presentation compared only the highway rating of the diesel Equinox to those of various hybrid compact crossovers, not the car's combined rating.\nIt stressed several times that the diesel Cruze and Equinox will be most attractive to drivers who cover lots of miles at highway speeds, where the vehicles may well overachieve on their EPA ratings.\nIndeed, over our standard drive route of two-thirds highway miles and one-third city and suburban traffic, the automatic Cruze Diesel we tested earlier this year returned a stunning 48.2 mpg reading on the trip computer.\nThat was significantly better than the car's EPA ratings, which are 31 mpg city, 47 mpg highway, and 37 mpg combined.\nDiesel fuel has roughly 20 percent more energy per gallon, but its cost differential with gasoline is less than that in most states, making it a good value.\nThe price differential for the diesel engine",
        "baseline": ", however, compared straight across to an Equinox with the 1.5-liter gasoline turbo-4, is $2,195.\nOil changes are required every 7,500 miles for the diesel engine, Chevy says, and the 4.1-gallon tank for Diesel Exhaust Fluid (urea solution) holds enough for 5,000 to 6,000 miles.\nThe Equinox won't necessarily have the diesel compact crossover market to itself, however, if Mazda follows through on its plans to launch a 2018 Mazda CX-5 diesel.\nAfter a lengthy delay during which Mazda concluded that a pricey selective catalytic reduction, or urea injection, system would be required to clean the exhaust adequately, that vehicle is expected to launch sometime this fall.\nFor the subset of small crossover buyers interested in diesels, then, it should prove an interesting comparison—and might possibly get Mazda a bit of consideration from the much larger pool of Chevy buyers to boot.",

        "prompt": "Nearly two minutes to play. Michigan State down three. Crisler Arena howling. Michigan students swaying. Winning time looming. Break for media timeout.\nKalin Lucas, the team&apos;s sometimes silent point guard, barking instructions to teammates. Telling them they&apos;d better not surrender an inch on defense. Telling them every rebound better be a Green rebound. Telling them Michigan was not winning this game.\nFor a second, Izzo simply enjoyed the view. Then he spoke. \"Is it all right if I talk, Kalin?\" Izzo asked.\nPlayer and coach exchanged a nod. Next thing you knew Crisler Arena was as quiet as an art exhibit, and Michigan State (18-3) was looking like a team you&apos;d better return to the list of contenders completely capable of finishing the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in early April.\nA basket by Raymar Morgan. Then a game-wining jumper by Lucas with 3.5 seconds to play. Michigan State 57, Michigan 56. The Wolverines tasted that same splash of heartburn that Minnesota tasted last weekend when Lucas hit a game-winner to beat the Gophers, too.\nSuddenly the Spartans are 8-0 in the Big Ten, at least two games ahead of everybody in the loss column. Magic Johnson and Mateen Cleaves delivered national titles to East Lansing, but they didn&apos;t start 8-0 in the league. It&apos;s a first for the Spartans as they await a Saturday visit by Northwestern and then trips to Wisconsin and Illinois next week.\nIzzo delivered hugs in the locker room. One of the first went to Lucas.\n\"Maybe now you understand why I was on you the way I was, because I know what you&apos;re capable of doing,\" Izzo said.\nMaybe now everybody understands -- without hyperventilating. It was Dec. 29 when Izzo told Lucas he didn&apos;t want him at practice that day. You would have thought the coach had announced that Magic Johnson&apos;s jersey was being pulled down at the Breslin Center. The news led one segment on the Big Ten Network and dominated the crawl on another network. The message boards warped into meltdown mode.\nIzzo has directed five of the last 11 Michigan State teams to the Final Four. He understands the rhythms of how habits formed in December shape what happens in March. A player as gifted and as gritty as Kalin Lucas needed to lead more forcefully than Lucas was leading. MSU had lost three of its first dozen games. This was no freshman. Lucas is a junior who had directed the Spartans into Detroit, his hometown, for the 2009 national championship game.\n\"We need Kalin to score, pass, defend, rebound, lead, sell popcorn and coach the team,\" Izzo said. \"He understood some of that, but I don&apos;t think he understood all of it. I wasn&apos;t looking for him to lead in a rah-rah style. I was looking for him to embrace his teammates more.\"\nIn Lucas, Morgan, Draymond Green, Durrell Summers, Chris Allen and Delvon Roe, Michigan State has a formidable core. But the Spartans aren&apos;t blessed with as many potential high NBA draft picks as Kentucky, Kansas, Syracuse or Texas. The Spartans don&apos;t have a DeMarcus Cousins, Damion James, Cole Aldrich or Wesley Johnson glaring from the post. They need a collective buzz - stirred by Kalin Lucas.\nIt wasn&apos;t just that Michigan State had been beaten by Florida, North Carolina and Texas. It was that State averaged more than 18 turnovers in those defeats - and Izzo could not tolerate that.\nHere&apos;s another set of numbers you don&apos;t associate with a Tom Izzo team: The Spartans had been outscored by a combined 11 points in the final two minutes or so of those losses.\nIzzo wanted more. He had to have more if the Spartans intended to survive against Purdue, Wisconsin",
        "baseline": ", Ohio State and the others itching to displace MSU atop the Big Ten.\n\"I told him not to come to practice,\" Izzo said. \"I told him he could go in the other gym and shoot, or he could watch extra video or he could go sit in my office and think about what he was ready to do to make us a better team.\"\nDid it work? Roll video from the final two minutes of the Minnesota and Michigan wins, when State outscored those teams by five points. Are the Spartans better? They have not lost another game. Feel free to connect the dots.\n\"I don&apos;t know exactly where we are,\" Izzo said. \"Our schedule has been bizarre. It&apos;s about to get a lot tougher. But we&apos;re going in the right direction.\"\nFollowing the lead of Kalin Lucas.\nCheck out Rick Bozich&apos;s blog .",

        "prompt": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a.k.a. the stimulus act, provides more money for college financial aid. President Obama's proposed budget includes even more changes, but they need congressional approval.\nHere's a look at what will happen under the stimulus act and what could happen under Obama's budget.\nPell Grants: The stimulus act increases funding for Pell Grants, which go to students from low- and moderate-income families, generally those making less than $40,000 a year. These grants do not have to be repaid and can be used for tuition and living expenses.\nFor the 2008-09 school year, Pell Grants range from $400 to $4,731. The stimulus bill adds $500 to the maximum for 2009-10 only. Including a previously scheduled increase, that brings the year's maximum to $5,350.\nMark Kantrowitz, publisher of Finaid.com, estimates that the stimulus bill will increase the number of Pell Grant recipients by about 800,000. Many new recipients won't get the maximum grant, though, \"because they will be on the edge of eligibility,\" he says.\nObama's budget would transform the grants into an entitlement program, like Social Security and Medicare. That means money would go into the program every year automatically, according to a formula, instead of being partially dependent on annual appropriations from Congress. The maximum Pell Grant would start at $5,500 in 2010-11 and go up each year by the consumer price index plus one percentage point.\nNancy Coolidge, who coordinates student financial aid for the UC system, supports the entitlement idea, but would like Obama to go a step further and index Pell Grant eligibility to the regional cost of living, so more students in high-cost areas would qualify.\nTax credit revamp: Today, most undergrads or their parents - depending on who pays the bills - can claim one of three tax breaks: the Hope Scholarship, the Lifetime Learning credit or the tuition and fees deduction. All three have different rules and income limits.\nThe stimulus act replaces the Hope Scholarship with the more generous American Opportunity Tax Credit. The change is effective for only for tax years 2009 and 2010, unless Congress extends it.\nThe existing Hope Scholarship, which is really a tax credit, can only be claimed for students in their first two years of college. The maximum credit is $1,800. It is phased out, or gradually reduced to zero, for singles with adjusted gross incomes between $48,000 and $58,000 and for married couples with incomes between $96,000 and $116,000. The Hope credit is not refundable, which means you cannot claim it if you don't earn enough to pay income tax. It can be claimed only for tuition and fees.\nThe American Opportunity tax credit can be claimed in years one through four of college. The maximum is $2,500 per year. The income phaseout range rises to $80,000 to $90,000 for singles and $160,000 to $180,000 for couples. And it's partially refundable: You can claim up to $1,000 even if you don't pay federal income tax. It can also be claimed against textbook expenses.\nObama was hoping to replace all three college tax breaks with the American Opportunity credit, but the other two are still available.\nThe Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition and fees deduction can be used for any year of college, including grad school. But Kantrowitz says most families will choose the American Opportunity credit over the other two for undergrads, because the other two are less generous and have lower income limits.\nWork study: The stimulus act adds $200 million for federal work study, enough for an additional 181,000 recipients, Kantrowitz estimates.\n529",
        "baseline": "s and computers: The stimulus act also allows tax-free withdrawals from 529 college savings plans to buy a student a computer.\nStudent loans: The stimulus act doesn't change student loans. But Obama's budget would end the Federal Family Education Loan Program.\nThis program provides federal subsidies to private-sector lenders who make government-guaranteed Stafford and Plus loans to students and their parents. The U.S. Department of Education, which provides these same loans at many colleges through its direct lending program, would take the place of the private-sector program.\nObama says eliminating subsidies would save the government money.

Angus King (I-ME) is holding a 3;30 pm et presser in Brunswick, ME to discuss with which party he will caucus next year.\nHe was telling everyone who’d listen last night that he’s open to caucusing with the GOP if they retook the Senate. That appears to be his Plan B. Plan A was (or is?) to organize some sort of independent/centrist caucus in the Senate that would serve as a balance of power between the two parties. Er, why would any Republican moderate want to join a caucus like that now that they’re back in charge, knowing that it might cost them committee chairmanships to do so?\nIt’s one thing to switch parties, as Joe Manchin might conceivably do. That would indicate a commitment to one’s new caucus that would, presumably, persist even if the other party takes the Senate back in 2016. There’s value in that. What would the GOP get, though, from accepting King into the fold and handing him some plum committee slots, with no assurance that he wouldn’t turn around and caucus with Democrats again two years from now? It’d be one thing if they were sitting at 59 votes and he was promising to be the 60th vote for cloture on all bills supported by the leadership, but even with 55 seats Republicans would be nowhere near that. In which case, why would they care if King wants to caucus with them? What’s he offering here? Stay tuned. He’s going to speak at 3:30.\nUpdate: If Sullivan and Cassidy win and King and Manchin both agree to caucus with the GOP, now you’re at 56 seats. The closer you get to 60, the more attractive it is to add indies and centrist Democrats to your caucus. But, er, there are no indies and centrist Democrats left after these two, right?

The GOP can argue that they are the true party of broad-based governance if they can attract an independent like King to switch caucuses, and a Democrat like Manchin to switch parties. It would be a PR move, and a wise one at a low cost. They might bargain more for Manchin than for King, who really has nowhere else to go as an independent, but both Senators would still be joining the GOP caucus on the GOP’s terms.\nUpdate (AP): Clown show, bro.\nAngus King announces that he will NOT switch to the GOP.

Youthfully naive, he was scared he might lose his if he came too close.\nThe pain of witnessing this strained interaction between her children inspired their mother, Tracey Clark of Columbia, to join the national war against cancer.\nRallying on the National Mall in Washington yesterday, Clark and her daughter, who is in remission, joined an estimated 80,000 cancer patients, loved ones, activists, celebrities and politicians who united behind a single message: It's time for a cure.\n\"We want to be the generation that ends the war on cancer, and ends it with a victory,\" said Vice President Al Gore.\n\"We are united as Americans to fight this cause.\"\nIn the United States alone, cancer claims an estimated 1,500 people every day. Yesterday's event, known as \"The March, Coming Together to Conquer Cancer,\" was billed as the first large-scale demonstration against the disease to involve people and groups other than patients, physicians and researchers. Organizers said they hoped to draw attention to the need for more investment in cancer prevention, research and quality health care for Americans.\nThroughout the day, speakers showered the crowd with statistics related to the disease: Cancer is expected to kill 564,800 Americans this year, the American Cancer Society estimates. Half of all men, and one-third of all women, will develop some form of cancer.\nIn Maryland, the society projects that 10,500 people will die of the disease in 1998. Statewide this year, the society expects 22,900 new cancer cases to be reported.\n\"People are angry and frustrated,\" said Dr. Donald Coffey, an oncology researcher at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.\n\"They believe that there has been a war, and it has failed. This hasn't been a war on cancer. This has been a skirmish.\"\nCoffey, former president of the American Association for Cancer Research and an organizer of yesterday's events, complained that 75 percent of cancer research grant proposals are denied funding.\nThe doctor joined about 250 people who crammed into five buses at the Johns Hopkins Medical School campus early yesterday and made the trip to Washington.\nThe event was endorsed by more than 500 organizations, including the American Cancer Society.\n\"There are so many people affected, and this is such a great opportunity to reach a wider audience,\" said society spokesman Steve Jones, who estimated that the mid-Atlantic division of the organization bused in 1,500 people, many from Maryland.\nBrian Devlin, 48, of Baltimore, who co-chairs the Greater Baltimore Alliance for Cancer Survivorship, said the event was momentous because for the first time, activists seeking cures for the various forms of cancer were launching a unified campaign, instead of squabbling for funding. \"Research cures cancer -- that's the reality,\" said Devlin, who is in his eleventh year of remission after being diagnosed with leukemia.\nVicki Davidson, 46, of Pottstown, Pa., believes she was helped by research. Doctors told her last year that she had an advanced form of lung cancer that was inoperable. But after she endured nine courses of an experimental chemotherapy, doctors were able to remove what remained of the tumor.\n\"I want to help other people,\" said Davidson, pointing out that her hair was returning. She held a sign that read, \"I want to live, not die.\"\n\"Some people are calling me a miracle,\" she said.\nSinger Aretha Franklin and super-model Cindy Crawford gave the event celebrity status. Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the event's honorary chairman, gave a spirited, podium-pounding speech, insisting that elected officials follow through on promises for more research funding.\nGore, whose sister died of lung cancer, called in his address for more access to clinical trials, tighter privacy laws for medical records so Americans who are told that their genetic code makes them likely to develop cancer are not denied health coverage, and more spending on research. The Clinton administration and Congress are already planning to increase the cancer research budget for next year.\nBut in the shadow of the main stage were smaller-scale events perhaps equally as important.\nClark, the Maryland mother -- whose daughter, Morgan, now 5, has received a good prognosis for a full life -- was introduced at an early-morning ceremony where she helped to unveil a mammoth quilt, covered with little,",
        "baseline": " hand-made squares, each in memory of a child who was a cancer patient.\nClark, who helped to come up with the idea for the nationwide quilt project, has started a Web site -- www.thefamilyplace.org -- which offers parents of child cancer patients information about cures and helps parents to communicate with one another and create support groups.\nIn another event, 76-year-old Berkeley V. Bennett of New Haven Mills, Vt., told a panel of leading physicians that cancer doctors need to be more patient-friendly. Bennett has started a support group in his town for prostate cancer patients.\nAt another tent, members of People Animals Love spoke of how they cheer up cancer patients in hospitals and nursing homes by bringing animals to visit.\n\"We visited a retired general recently,\" said Margo Edmunds, standing beside her 7-year-old border collie, Tess. \"He was very depressed, and terminally ill. And he missed his dogs.\"",

Some say Ray Guy, formerly of the Oakland Raiders, is a deserving candidate. The Giants’ punter, Steve Weatherford, was a force in the recently concluded Super Bowl.\nBut I nominate President Barack Obama for the honor. He’s already won the Nobel Peace Prize. Why not the Hall of Fame too?\nHis fourth, and hopefully last, budget, for Fiscal Year 2013, should guarantee his entry. Like his other three, this budget kicks all our fiscal problems down the road, to a day of reckoning — after he is safely reelected and his all important “legacy” secure.\nIt’s hard to know who has shirked their responsibilities more: The president, who has submitted another unserious effort, or the Senate, which has refused to even enact a budget for the third straight year. The Republican House produced a budget last year and will do so again this year — but according to the president and many in the mainstream media, they are the problem. Go figure.\nIt’s easier to recap what Obama’s budget will NOT do rather than what it does because it doesn’t do much. It does not make any dent in our annual deficit. It projects nearly a trillion-dollar deficit for the fourth year in a row and actually increases deficit projections by $200 billion for the current fiscal year.\nIn the third year of a recovery that he is now crowing about, we still have trillion-dollar annual deficits. If this doesn’t tell you that our problem is",
        "baseline": " too much spending, not insufficient revenue, I’m not sure what does.\nThis budget does not come close to addressing the debt in the long run – meaning in the next decade. Obama’s budget claims to reduce the deficit over a 10- year period by $3 trillion, almost exclusively through tax increases and cuts in military spending.\nThis budget does not make America more competitive or our tax structure more dynamic. Obama continues to call for higher taxes on individuals — including small businesses that generate most of our new jobs. What sense does that make when the work force is now shrinking because of a lack of jobs?\nHe also proposes higher taxes on one of the most dynamic sectors of our economy — the oil and gas industry.

The Republican National Committee sent out a press release shortly after calling them \"offensive,\" and demanding he apologize. The McCain campaign has also highlighted the comments several times this campaign season. An AP Fact Check later reported Western forces had been killing civilians at a higher rate than insurgents.\nPalin also commented Friday on her widely-panned series of interviews with Katie Couric, telling Fox interviewer she did not think the CBS News anchor asked enough issue-based questions.\n“I did feel there were a lot of things she was missing in terms of an opportunity to ask what a VP candidate stands for, what the values are that are represented in our ticket,\" Palin said. \"I guess I have to apologize for being a bit annoyed, but that’s also an indication about being outside that Washington elite, outside that media elite also, and just wanting to talk to Americans without the filter and let them know what we stand for.\"\nIn two separate and lengthy interviews with Couric over the last week, Palin seemed to struggle with a number of answers, including a defense of McCain's record on regulation issues. She also appeared to stumble when relating her views on the financial bailout, her foreign policy credentials, her preferred news sources of news, and a Supreme Court case she disagrees with.\n\"Man, no matter what you say you are gonna get clobbered,\" Palin told Fox about her heavily-scrutinized performance. \"You choose to answer you are going to get clobbered on the answer. If you choose to pivot and try to go onto another subject that you believe Americans want to hear about, you get clobbered for that too.\"\nThis woman is really starting to be annoying! Not only her screechy voice, but her self-righteous, know-it-all attitude, which just basically shows she is desperatley trying to disguise how inept she is.\nAmerica, please don't let her or McCain near the white house!!\nShe was wonderful in the debate.\nAwwww please.....I am voting for Barack just because I do not want to hear her 3rd grade answers again!\nShe survived the debate which she and her about 20 advisors crammed for. Now how's about we go on to Meet the Press or any other intelligent interviews?\nAnd Sean Hannity or the other dunces at Fox News don't count!\nJust because she isn't an elitest, East Coast snob does not mean she is stupid folks. Personally, I am sick and tired of this bunch of idiots on the \"hill\" telling the rest of American what we need. Obama is by far the worst snobby, smirking, \"I'm better than you\" elitest of them all. I would rather vote for a team that knows what I experience than that lying, South Chicago, Daley-Machine robot Obama. Because he doesn't have a clue.\nAnd not knowing what I vp does, or not thinking much about a war that had gone on for years (Iraq) doesn't automatically disqualify her?\nThis is the same woman who would use her \"power as vice president\" over the senate. Yes the vp is the president of the senate and acts as a tie breaking vote, but I think she missed the boat about the checks and balances and seperations of our three branches.\nAs for Obama raising taxes the has constantly been proven as misleading, maybe her campaign should look at the fact that ECONOMISTS feel the Obama camp is offering the better economic plan.\nSarah should go home and keep a sharp eye out for Putin flying over.\nSilly Sarah might be qualified as a writer for Saturday Night Live but, anything else, no way!\nWhat he did was speak the truth...Sarah Palin obviously cannot handle the truth.\nThis women showed me last night althought she is very \"folky\" that I want to have a VP twhoknows more than what she was taught in a few weeks.\nI do not understand the people that will vote for McCain because Sarah Palin is a mom and is nice!!!\nThis is our Country we are talking about!! We need someone who knows the law, someone who can comprehend any situation that comes up and not act impulsively as we have seen McCain do.\nWe need Joe Biden helping President Obama.\nWho cares what she thinks.\nThis individual is not prepared to be the next vice-president of the United States. Period.\nBiden did an excellent job last night and to the intelligent Americans, he showed the alarming disparities in the Obama/Biden vs. McCain/Palin philosophies. I am afraid for America if McCain gets into office with a vice-president Palin.\nSide note: The news media cannot attack Palin either! Why?

        "prompt": "The wristwatch was nearly killed off by the cell phone revolution, but with the rise of the smartphone it’s about to evolve into something more powerful than it’s ever been.\nInvestors, and a number of industry heavies, have just acquired the smartwatch business of Meta Watch, as well as all its IP. The players include Juho Pinomaa, the former president of Sunnto (which makes dive computers, smart sports, and GPS watches), formerly of Nokia, and Bill Geiser and David Rosales, who used to lead the connected watch division of Fossil. The developer-centric Meta Watch is already due on sale this month, but these moves show that there’s serious interest in the future of the digital watch–and Meta is only one of the players. Lest you doubt the seriousness of these moves, consider that one of the players involved is Apple.\nChances are, you don’t wear a watch and haven’t for quite some time. Meanwhile, your smartphone is shoved into a pocket, briefcase, or purse right now, and all your SMS’s, phone calls, Twitter updates, and Facebook statuses are reeling on in the fabric-lined darkness. It would be amazingly handy (pun intended), in a world where more and more of us “check in” to places, snap photos, and share status feeds at an ever increasing pace, to have all that possible on your wrist.\nFaced by shrinking sales of its traditional watches that really do little more than tell the time, Fossil began a project some time ago to develop a future connected watch–a digital device that would offer much more data to a tiny display. Meta Watch was the result, a mini computer, with Bluetooth and display, running a custom operating system. It’s now an independant entity, and it has an unusual remit: To appeal to developers and hardware hackers, to try to establish an ecosystem of apps and new ways of utilizing the display as an additional way to access what’s going on on your smartphone (mainly Android units, at first).\nAnd Meta Watch isn’t alone. In Italy, two entrepreneurs are busy finalizing the design of the I’mWatch. It’s tiny, slim, highly styled (and highly expensive–in some jewel-encrusted iterations it costs around $15,000) and unlike the Meta it has a full-colour display and sophisticated touch interface enabled by its own on-board Android OS. It’s on pre-order starting at €250 now, and is due to make its first public appearance at the ARM tech conference in just 44 days. Though the company is cagey about what it can be used for, its promotional material shows calendar apps, weather feeds, MP3 players, news feeds, Facebook apps, and Twitter too–and it’ll come with a bunch of pre-loaded apps as well as extras via the proprietary “I’mStore.” Though it’s compatible with the iPhone, the I’mWatch seems to be a cleverer implementation of something Sony tried with its LiveView innovation for its own Android units.\nThese two devices are smart, sophisticated extra displays that run in addition to your smartphone and let you take some of the utility onto your wrist: They can buzz, for example, to let you know a call is coming in and prompting you to peep at the watch to see who’s calling–much easier than fishing a phone out of a pocket or bag–and if you were on a morning commute, you’d then perhaps decide to leave the call until later.\nBut don’t forget Apple–its touchscreen iPod Nano was an unexpected hit as a watch, spawning a large industry in peripheral watch straps. Apple seems to, at first, have not expected the Nano to be used in this way, and though it sported an attractive analog watch display, it wasn’t enabled to pop up when the iPod was prompted from sleep–it took an update to make this change. But the existing Nano doesn’t have any connectivity, and while it does run apps, they’re all proprietary and can’t be changed. We know Apple is planning an update to the device, possibly adding in a camera–but that’s all we know.\nIt’s possible Apple is planning something novel with the device to turn it into a full-fledged wrist computer, if not for this immediate update then for one in the near future. The first clue is the incorporation of Bluetooth 4.0 in newer Apple gear. The standard is a lower power consumption one than current Bluetooth hardware, thus improving battery life, and offers simpler “pairing” between devices–meaning it would be perfectly plausible for your iPhone or Mac to quickly, efficiently, and simply send data to your nearby Nano.\nAnd with Apple’s control of the app ecosystem, a connected iPod Nano could become a powerful competitor to the I’mWatch and Meta Watch. You can easily imagine Apple building in a motion-gesture system to the device, meaning you’d simply have to shake your wrist to reject an incoming call on your iPhone. And though the prototype iPod Nano had a camera on the back, there’s not much to stop Apple adding it to the front or side of the device to act as a FaceTime camera or useful go-everywhere camera. With sophisticated voice recognition on the way for the iPhone, the tiny screen of a wrist Nano wouldn’t even be a barrier to",
        "baseline": " updating your Twitter feed.\nAnd that’s why you’ll buy another wristwatch. Smartphones are, of course, incredibly powerful tools. But as they get more powerful, many seem to be getting slightly larger–even the iPhone 5 is rumored to be bigger, if flatter.\nThe always-accessible nature of a smartwatch may appeal to a generation who’re used to “checking in” on Foursquare everywhere they go, as well as basic status reading and updating on Facebook. And all those rumors of NFC payments get even more interesting if you consider that you could actually pay by simply waving your wrist over a sensor pad, with all the NFC circuits in the watch and its wristband, and all the hardware handshaking–including store loyalty cards and in-store downloaded ads–happening on the phone, securely in your pocket.\nMerely telling the time by glancing at your wrist?

        "prompt": "As UK Film Shows Sri Lankan General Silva Bragging of Killing 1500 Civilians, What Will UN &Ban Ki-moon Say?\nUNITED NATIONS, March 15 -- During the killing of tens of thousands of civilians by the Sri Lankan government in 2009, the UN withheld its own count of casualties, withdrew its international staff and even played a role in luring to surrender people who were then summarily executed.\nThe UN Secretariat never called for a ceasefire, and the UN Security Council never had a formal meeting on the mass killings. Now one of the military leaders of the campaign, Brigadier General Shavendra Silva, has been made a part of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's Senior Advisory Group on Peacekeeping Operations, and Ban has had nothing to say beyond \"it's up to member states.\"\nSilva appears in UK Channel 4's \"Sri Lanka’s Killing Fields: War Crimes Unpunished,\" which premiered last night on television in the UK, and re-appeared overnight on YouTube. Click here to view, for Silva from Minute 21:56.\nThe documentary focused on four particular war crimes, including an assault on Putumattalan which killed at least 1,500 civilians.\nThe direct assault was carried out by the 58th Division under the command of Shavendra Silva, who appears on screen describing it as \"very successful.\"\nWhile the Sri Lankan Mission to the UN has in a letter sent to Ban's spokesman's office and select UN scribes attacked Inner City Press for writing about Silva, claiming as subsequently did some in the UN Asia Group that Silva's 58th Division is not directly indicted in the UN Panel of Experts report, this new footage including Silva's bragging should put an end to that.\nWith so much talk at the UN about accountability, how can the general who led and bragged about the killing of 1,500 civilians continue as an adviser to the UN on peacekeeping? We'll see.\nThe documentary also has former UK foreign minister David Miliband and former UN humanitarian chief John Holmes taking positions much more protective of civilians than what either did when they had power. Holmes, for example, resisted calling for a ceasefire.\nOn the May 2009 trip to Sri Lanka with Ban Ki-moon and his outgoing political chief Lynn Pascoe, which Inner City Press went on and covered, Holmes on the record on the plane bemoaned all the e-mail pleas he was receiving from Tamils, saying \"I just delete them.\"\nAfter from Colombo Inner City Press reported the quote, Holmes demanded that it be removed, using other journalists from UK-based media organizations to pressure Inner City Press. Maybe he misspoke. Now in a cushy academic job, Holmes says Sri Lanka got away with it. Yes: with the UN's and OCHA's help.\nHolmes refusal in 2009 to call for a ceasefire stands in contrast to his successor Baroness Valerie Amos' stance on Syria. But is this a personal or political difference?\nInner City Press asked the UK Mission to the UN \"does the UK have a position on if it is appropriate that Sri Lankan Brigadier General Shavendra Silva serve on the UN Senior Advisory Group on Peacekeeping Operations, given the way he and his 58th Division are depicted in the S-G's Panel of Experts' Report on Sri Lanka, and in UK Channel 4 films, past and to be broadcast in the UK tomorrow night?\"\nMidday on March 14, UK Mission spokesman Daniel Shepherd replied that the UK \"highly values the Senior Advisory Group, and our own representative on it will work to help the Group come up with the best possible recommendations on the issues they are addressing. The Chairperson of the SAG has, following consultation with other SAG members, advised Major General Shavendra Silva that his participation is not appropriate or helpful for the purposes of the Group. We understand that he will not participate in its deliberations.\"\nThat is still by no means certain. Inner City Press covered the Asia Group meeting at which Sri Lanka tried to rally other countries in the Group to the defense of Silva; Ban Ki-moon has not spoken in support of Frechette.\nDespite the harrowing footage and the high number of civilians killed, the Sri Lanka issue does not have the traction of Syria, or even #Kony2012. As viewers, mostly in the UK, tweeted about the film on Wednesday night, many expressed disgust at Ban's UN and said that if Sri Lanka had a lot of oil, the West would have intervened as it did in Libya.\nBut there are others not directly interested in oil who have held back on Sri Lanka, perhaps due to the specter of terrorism. To a three organization panel at the UN on March 14, Inner City Press asked if Silva's position as UN adviser on peacekeeping, and Ban Ki-moon silence, were appropriate.\nThe representative of Amnesty International said that advisers should be \"vetted\" for war crimes. But the representative of Human Rights Watch, when asked Wednesday on UN TV, had nothing to say on the topic. Video here, at end. HRW has previously refused to even summarize its boss Ken Roth's meeting with Ban Ki-moon, saying that to do so might undermine HRW's \"access.\" Access for what?\nThere are many for whom it is convenient that the killing of tens of thousand of civilians in Sri Lanka in",

As exposed by Inner City Press in video, Ban Ki-moon made time to watch the government \"rebuttal\" before he ever watched Killing Fields I. What will Ban say about Killing Fields II?\nBan Ki-moon shook Silva's hand, and berated his own staff in front of Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa. War crimes unpunished, indeed.",

But Cahill then rallied to win six of the next seven games for the victory, including a lengthy decisive game which she won on her fifth match point.\n\"I wasn't nervous at all,\" Cahill said, \"but when it got to match point, I got nervous. I was giving her shots to put away. I was relieved when I finally got that last point.\"\nAlso among the upset victims were two of California's three representatives at the event, as Palos Verdes Estates' Lucinda Gurney and Iwalani McCalla of Los Altos were eliminated.\nJust before Cahill's win, No. 6-seeded Sandra Birch of New York defeated Gurney, Tennis Magazine's co-Player of 1984, 6-2, 5-7, 6-0, in another quarterfinal match of the 16s.\n\"I didn't play well at all,\" Gurney said. \"I wasn't really concentrating.

        "prompt": "Are we really secular or pagan?\nBy Peter Sellick - posted Wednesday, 12 April 2017 Sign Up for free e-mail updates!\nSecularism is an ideology that tells us that there exists a neutral and rational sphere of knowledge by which communities may be ruled to the exclusion of any religious knowledge. While religious ideas are tolerated, they are relegated to the realm of the private. Thus political actors are expected to place their religious understanding to one side and to collaborate within the neutrality of secularism.\nThe first thing to be said about this is that there is no such neutral sphere. The error of secularism is that it limits what it understands as being religion to identified belief systems and fails to see that religious thought and practice does not have to be named as \"religious\" to hold humanity in its power. It is a common observation that anti-religious regimes in the past such as the French and Russian revolutions, nazism and fascism all exhibit religious aspects. These include the attachment to ideology, personality cults, ritual practices and mass man mentality.\nIn order to understand the absence of a neutral sphere we must understand more deeply the essence of religion. Religion is that which, after the Latin, binds. Thus religion cannot be restricted to the known and recognised religions but exists as the common human desire to trust in something and to be bound by that something. Indeed, it is impossible to live without unsupported assumptions and the belief that is derived from them. We are all believers of some kind.\nThis analysis reveals that secularism is not neutral and never can be because there is no sphere of human existence that is free from deep investment in something. We can name such secular idols as the market, life style, health, prestige, power, influence, progress, self-esteem, consumption etc. All of these can be idols; things that determine human hope, desire and action may be found within a supposedly non-religious sphere. As Luther observed: the heart is a factory for idols.\nThe deceptive thing about idols is that anything, even the most basic impulses and foundations of our lives can become idolised. The family, for example, exists as the place of nurture and love for all of us. However, the family can become idolatrous as in the Mafia. Idols do not exist without human investment. It is that investment that robs us of our freedom and installs idols of the heart.\nIt follows that there is no such thing as a neutral sphere from which government can operate that is free of idolatry. We might think that we can govern under the auspices of reason alone but this is to misunderstand how reason works. Reason always brings with it presuppositions that cannot be derived by reason alone. A brief course in European philosophy will hammer this fact home. There have, been attempts to find foundations for reason that do not presume anything and thus do not rely on some kind of belief. In the seventeenth century it was thought that mathematics could be such a foundation. However, the results have been stunted and obviously fail to address the simplest questions such as \"who am I, and what should I do?\"\nSecularists have used reason as a weapon against religious thought from the beginning even in spite of two thousand years of theological research that held reason as its guiding light. The priests of secularism have driven a wedge between faith and reason that may make sense at the level of simplistic belief but is wide of the mark when it comes to the theology of the Church. When one reads Augustine, or Aquinas, or Calvin we find reason at work on the key questions that face humanity of identity, meaning and purpose. Reason is a tool that is used to understand and extend traditions of thought about what it means to be human.\nI read recently that it is inaccurate to describe Australia or indeed any country as being secular. Rather, a more accurate description would be that Australia is in the grip of paganism. Paganism is multiple idolatry: the worship of many things that are not God. The idea that the secular sphere is free of such idolatry is easily confuted as theologically naïve. It is the nature of the human heart to manufacture idols and the ideology of secularism has no power to stem the flow. Indeed, it seems that in the absence of the iconoclasm of the Church, which is one of its central functions, idolatry increases on every front.\nSecularism is paganism in disguise. It assumes that because no identifiable traditional religion can be identified that religious assumptions and practices are absent. In our quest to free ourselves from religion we have fallen into the very pit of religious thought in the same way that the quest for freedom in the French and Russian revolution led to the Terror and the worst tyranny of all.\nA key function of the Church is iconoclasm, the destruction of idols. It is also true that the Church, in faintheartedness and in fear for its own life, has betrayed us in this task. The Church does not seem to see that it presides over the destruction of \"religion",
        "baseline": "\" in order to bear witness to the one icon of God, the image that replaces all idols, the crucified Jesus.\nPart of our problem is that we have assumed that all religions vary in details but are much of a muchness. But Christianity differs from the world religions in that it contains a critique of religion itself. It was because of this critique that Jesus was framed and murdered, such was the fear of the religious authorities of the time.\nSo there is a paradox here, Christianity looks like a religion quacks like a religion and so must be a religion. However, it also bears witness to the end of all religion and the beginning of faith. In the shadow of the cross religion is faithlessness. It is in the passion of Christ that religion is judged because it was religion that hammered in the nails.\nChristianity is the critique of all religion including the secular kind that declares that it is not a religion. In the final analysis, secularism does not really exist.",

        "prompt": "A military convoy arrived at Salisbury district hospital and investigators in hazmat suits were seen at the cemetery where Sergei Skripal’s wife was buried as the investigation into the nerve agent attack on the Russian former spy gathered pace.\nMore than a dozen vehicles were at the hospital as part of an operation to remove a police car from the site in the aftermath of last Sunday’s attack.\nTwo military lorries arrived at A&E with police escorts, incident response units and an ambulance. Earlier on Friday it was reported that about 180 military personnel had been called in to assist the investigation into the attempted murder of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.\nThe additional personnel were deployed to remove potentially contaminated evidence. Meanwhile, police were seen at the cemetery where the grave of Skripal’s wife, Liudmila, and a memorial to his son, Alexander, who both died in the last few years, lie in adjacent plots that had been cordoned off earlier in the week.\nPolice placed a blue forensic tent over the memorial to Alexander at Salisbury’s London Road cemetery. Fire officers in hazmat suits were seen pinning down the tent, while other officers in white suits and gas masks were seen packing items from the cemetery into a yellow barrel.\nIt had previously been reported that Liudmila died of cancer in 2012 aged 59, while Alexander Skripal died in March last year in St Petersburg, aged 43, in unknown circumstances.\nThe Metropolitan police said reports that a body had been exhumed on Friday were untrue. It is believed that Yulia Skripal may have visited her brother’s memorial stone on his birthday, 1 March – three days before she and her father were taken ill.\nAs the investigation entered a new phase, the authorities were still seeking to establish exactly where and when a British police officer was poisoned.\nDS Nick Bailey is seriously ill in hospital having visited the home of Skripal after the defector and his daughter were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday afternoon.\nInvestigators want to know whether Bailey visited the scene where the two Russians were found and was poisoned there or by items there, or whether the officer was contaminated on his visit to Skripal’s home.\nSources say that, while it is not certain, it is believed more likely that Bailey became contaminated on his visit to the home.\nUncertainty about how and where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned led to police requesting military assistance on Friday to secure contaminated evidence. It is understood that personnel from the Royal Marines, the RAF and chemical teams were involved in the operation.\nThe Met police said the units were called in because they had “the necessary capability and expertise” and urged the public not to be alarmed.\nSergei, 66, and Yulia, 33, are comatose in hospital after being found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre.\nThe investigation widened on Thursday as police sealed off the memorials to Liudmila and Alexander, and said 21 people had been treated as a result of the incident.\nBailey was described by Kier Pritchard, Wiltshire’s temporary chief constable, as “a massively dedicated officer”. Pritchard said the detective sergeant was “very anxious, very concerned” but sitting up in bed and talking. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, met Bailey during her visit to Salisbury district hospital on Friday.\nThe NHS confirmed that the Skripals were in a critical but stable condition, while Bailey was conscious in a serious but stable condition.\nRudd said: “It is still very serious for the two people subject to this outrageous attack. For the police officer, it is still serious but we understand he is conversing and engaging.\nRudd did not reveal further details about the substance, how it was deployed or who used it.\nIan Blair, who was Metropolitan police commissioner when the former spy Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London, has suggested one line of inquiry is that Skripal may have been exposed to the nerve agent in his own home.\n“Clearly what they’re trying to find out at the moment is how was this delivered personally. There obviously are some indications. The officer – I’m very sorry he’s been injured – has actually been to the house, whereas there’s a doctor who looked after the patients in the",

There may be some clues floating around in here,” Lord Blair said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\nBlair said that if the nerve agent was rare, as Rudd has said, then it should be possible to identify where it came from. “If this is rarer than sarin and VX it’s basically possible to identify the laboratory in which it was made. They would be able to establish where it came from – the level of authority is another matter,” he said.\nThe use of a nerve toxin is seen as a key indicator of possible Kremlin involvement, with such substances usually held only in state military stockpiles.\nMoscow has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack, the same line used when Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in his cup of tea.

But in the last six years, at the Whitney and Guggenheim museums, for example, only five of 58 solo shows were devoted to women; 53 were devoted to men. So there's something terribly askew at the professional level.\"\nWAVE organizers say protesters' plans include a march with balloons reading \"genius has no gender\" from the Whitney Museum to the Guggenheim Museum in New York; a gathering outside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington; exhibits, pickets and a barge ride down Texas' San Antonio River.\nLocal WAVE participants, all members of the Southern California chapter of the women's caucus, have conducted research to support their charges, as have many other WAVE groups.\n\"The neglect is at higher and higher levels,\" said artist Ruth Weisberg, USC fine arts professor and caucus national vice president. \"It's now fairly commonplace in Los Angeles for women to have gallery representation, but the problem is with museum retrospective exhibitions, catalogue representation and newspaper and magazine articles about solo shows.\"\nAnnie Shaver-Crandell, caucus national president and an art historian, said, \"My objection is that the institutions targeted by WAVE are often recipients of federal money. That money is generated from people like myself and I expect it to come back to people like myself.\"\n--Neither the County Museum of Art nor the Museum of Contemporary Art have ever mounted a major solo retrospective exhibition of a woman artist.\n--Between 1980 and 1986 at the County Museum of Art, 11% of all solo exhibitions featured women artists.\n--Los Angeles Times reviews of all solo exhibits--written by various Times art reviewers--from January, 1982, to March, 1986, averaged 24% women artists.\n--Herald Examiner reviews of solo exhibits--only those written by critic Christopher Knight in the paper's Sunday section--from October, 1983, to April, 1985, were 10% women artists.\nLocal WAVE researchers also cite a National Endowment for the Arts finding that in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area, 33% of professional artists are women.\nArtist Carol Neiman, co-coordinator of the local protest, said letters containing all local statistics will be sent to the County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A Times' reporter read the findings to directors of both museums last week before they had received the letters.\n\"I don't see that it's the business of the museum to start establishing quotas,\" said County Museum of Art Director Earl A. (Rusty) Powell tersely. \"The issue of quotas is not relevant to an educational institution devoted to quality and to the whole history of art.\"\nPowell said several women have recently been subjects of solo exhibits at the museum, including Eileen Cowan, Barbara Kruger, Maren Hassinger and Wendy MacNeil. He also noted the museum's 1977 group exhibit, \"Women Artists: 1550-1950.\"\nPowell acknowledged, however, that \"we have not had a major retrospective solo show of a woman artist; that would be true. But the museum has not excluded the work of women artists--the record certainly confirms that fact--and we never will.\"\nRichard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, said, \"This is a matter of great concern to us and a subject that plays a part in our decision-making process. We feel there's room for tremendous improvement and we will continue to improve that aspect of our programming.\"\nKoshalek also listed women artists who have had shows at the museum and said that next summer the museum will present a solo retrospective of about 50 works by Elizabeth Murray.\nNeiman said local WAVE participants hope to meet with Powell and Koshalek to discuss possible changes in the museums' representation of women artists. She suggested several artists for solo retrospective exhibits, from Georgia O'Keeffe to local artist Betye Saar.\nLos Angeles Times art writer Suzanne Muchnic, responding to the statistics, said, \"During my career as a critic, the situation has improved for women artists. Their work has become more adventurous, more prominently shown and more frequently reviewed. But our current coverage reflects the shows that are out there; we can't review exhibits that don't exist.\"\nHerald Examiner art critic Knight said, \"There's no question that women artists have an extremely tough time compared to male artists. But what bothers me is this approach. It adopts a kind of corporate, bottom-line mentality where you're looking at figures on paper and nothing else matters. It's addressing a cultural reality not through art but through business techniques.\"\nNot all the local caucus' findings were negative, however.\nResearchers found that from 1980 to 1986, 44% of all Municipal Art Gallery exhibits, group and solo, were devoted to women artists; that 43% of all shows at the County Museum's art rental gallery (which rents to museum members only) exhibited women artists' work, and 32% of all performance and video presentations from 1983 to 1986 at the Museum of Contemporary Art were women's works.\n\"There are people in Los Angeles giving really appropriate and significant attention to women artists,\" said Weisberg, who will deliver a speech Saturday.\nWeisberg, Neiman and local WAVE co-coordinator Cheri Gaulke all took part in a similar demonstration at the County Museum of Art in 1981. The trio was part of an ad-hoc committee, Artists Coalition for Equality, charging inequ",
        "baseline": "itable representation of both women and minority artists.\n\"But this time we're focusing on a broader survey,\" Weisberg said. \"We're doing this on the steps of City Hall to represent all of the Southland, not just one museum.\"\nAnd in 1984, members of the New York chapter of the 14-year-old women's caucus protested in front of Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art. (The 31-chapter caucus has about 4,000 members nationally--400 in Southern California--united to strengthen the role and status of women in art.) But WAVE organizers say this is the first demonstration of its type waged nationally.\n\"Our goal is to make people aware that progress has been uneven,\" Weisberg said, \"and to overcome the sense that the issue of inequality for women artists--and minority artists--is all in the past; that the problem has all been taken care of. We have made significant progress, but there is a lot more to accomplish.\"",

It’s too early (I suppose…) for Christmas carols and Christmas cookies and Christmas parties, but it’s just the right time to resolve to prioritize simplicity.\nQuakers are far from the only people who talk about simplicity, but it’s part of the core of our approach to Christianity.\nHere’s Psalm 27:4: “One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.” ONE thing. Not all the things, not a whole bunch of things, not even worship + a few other important things. ONE thing.\nThe word “",
        "baseline": "simplicity” gets associated with being old-fashioned, or homespun, or not on-trend, and all of those things can be true of the simple life. Pursuing Christian simplicity, though, is really just about removing distractions; resolutely ditching second-best baubles in order to better grasp the treasure at the center.\nAs you gear up for the holiday season, I encourage you to set a few priorities.\nMaybe that could be reading through and Advent devotional, or maybe you want to visit worship services at as many churches as possible, or maybe you have some friends with whom you can spend some intentional time in prayer.\nPut Christ at the center of your Christmas celebration, not as a battle cry against some secular outside force but in order to see your own heart renewed.\nSee if that doesn’t prepare you for a happier New Year!\nAnd of course, although it’s far too early: Merry Simple Christmas!",

        "prompt": "ACCORDING to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, John Seigenthaler Sr. is 78 years old and the former editor of The Tennessean in Nashville. But is that information, or anything else in Mr. Seigenthaler's biography, true?\nThe question arises because Mr. Seigenthaler recently read about himself on Wikipedia and was shocked to learn that he \"was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John and his brother Bobby.\"\n\"Nothing was ever proven,\" the biography added.\nMr. Seigenthaler discovered that the false information had been on the site for several months and that an unknown number of people had read it, and possibly posted it on or linked it to other sites.\nIf any assassination was going on, Mr. Seigenthaler (who is 78 and did edit The Tennessean) wrote last week in an op-ed article in USA Today, it was of his character.\nThe case triggered extensive debate on the Internet over the value and reliability of Wikipedia, and more broadly, over the nature of online information.\nWikipedia is a kind of collective brain, a repository of knowledge, maintained on servers in various countries and built by anyone in the world with a computer and an Internet connection who wants to share knowledge about a subject. Literally hundreds of thousands of people have written Wikipedia entries.\nMistakes are expected to be caught and corrected by later contributors and users.\nThe whole nonprofit enterprise began in January 2001, the brainchild of Jimmy Wales, 39, a former futures and options trader who lives in St. Petersburg, Fla. He said he had hoped to advance the promise of the Internet as a place for sharing information.\nIt has, by most measures, been a spectacular success. Wikipedia is now the biggest encyclopedia in the history of the world. As of Friday, it was receiving 2.5 billion page views a month, and offering at least 1,000 articles in 82 languages. The number of articles, already close to two million, is growing by 7 percent a month. And Mr. Wales said that traffic doubles every four months.\nStill, the question of Wikipedia, as of so much of what you find online, is: Can you trust it?\nAnd beyond reliability, there is the question of accountability. Mr. Seigenthaler, after discovering that he had been defamed, found that his \"biographer\" was anonymous. He learned that the writer was a customer of BellSouth Internet, but that federal privacy laws shield the identity of Internet customers, even if they disseminate defamatory material. And the laws protect online corporations from libel suits.\nHe could have filed a lawsuit against BellSouth, he wrote, but only a subpoena would compel BellSouth to reveal the name.\nIn the end, Mr. Seigenthaler decided against going to court, instead alerting the public, through his article, \"that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool.\"\nMr. Wales said in an interview that he was troubled by the Seigenthaler episode, and noted that Wikipedia was essentially in the same boat. \"We have constant problems where we have people who are trying to repeatedly abuse our sites,\" he said.\nStill, he said, he was trying to make Wikipedia less vulnerable to tampering. He said he was starting a review mechanism by which readers and experts could rate the value of various articles. The reviews, which he said he expected to start in January, would show the site's strengths and weaknesses and perhaps reveal patterns to help them address the problems.\nIn addition, he said, Wikipedia may start blocking unregistered users from creating new pages, though they would still be able to edit them.\nThe real problem, he said, was the volume of new material coming in; it is so overwhelming that screeners cannot keep up with it.\nAll of this struck close to home for librarians and researchers. On an electronic mailing list for them, J. Stephen Bolhafner, a news researcher at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, wrote, \"The best defense of the Wikipedia, frankly, is to point out how much bad information is available from supposedly reliable sources.\"\nJessica Baumgart, a news researcher at Harvard University, wrote that there were librarians voluntarily working behind the scenes to check information on Wikipedia. \"But, honestly,\" she added, \"in some ways, we're just as fallible as everyone else in some areas because our own knowledge is limited and we can't possibly fact-check everything.\"\nIn an interview, she said that her rule of thumb was to double-check everything and to consider Wikipedia as only one source.\n\"Instead of figuring out how to 'fix' Wikipedia -- something that cannot be done to our satisfaction,\" wrote Derek Willis, a research database manager at The Washington Post, who was speaking for himself and not The Post, \"we should focus our energies on educating",
        "baseline": " the Wikipedia users among our colleagues.\"\n\"People will be defamed,\" he said. \"But that's the way free speech is. Think about the gossip world. It spreads. There's no way to correct it, period. Wikipedia is not immune from that kind of maliciousness, but it is, relative to other features of life, more easily corrected.\"\nIndeed, Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0 and a longtime Internet analyst, said Wikipedia may, in that sense, be better than real life.\n\"The Internet has done a lot more for truth by making things easier to discuss,\" she said. \"Transparency and sunlight are better than a single point of view that can't be questioned.\"\nFor Mr. Seigenthaler, whose biography on Wikipedia has since been corrected, the lesson is simple: \"We live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and research, but populated by volunteer vandals with poison-pen intellects.\"",
        "llm_baseline": "\" It's a sign that peopleare paying attention to the nature of the information they find on Wikipedia. \" Mr.Wales said that he was not surprised by the popularity of Wikipedia,and that he had expected it from the beginning. \" I think it ' s a very important thing, \" he said. \" It ' s a sign that people are paying attention.. \" \" Mr.Wales said that he had been surprised by the number of people who had written to him to say that they had used Wikipedia to learn about a subject and then gone on to learn more. \" I think that ' s the most important thing, \" he said. \" It ' s not about the encyclopedia.It ' s about the community. \" Mr.Wales said that he had been surprised by the number of people who had written to him to say that they had used Wikipedia to learn about a subject and then gone on to learn more.. \" I think that ' s the most important thing, \" he said. \" It ' s not about the encyclopedia.It ' s about the community. \". \" I think that ' s the most important thing, \" he said.</s><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad><pad>",

        "prompt": "CALGARY, April 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - TransAlta Corporation (\"TransAlta\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:TA) (NYSE: TAC) today issued a letter to shareholders and filed its management information circular (the \"Circular\") for its annual and special meeting of shareholders (the \"Meeting\") to be held on April 26, 2019.\nTransAlta encourages shareholders to read the Circular to gain insight into the extensive efforts undertaken to seek and reflect shareholder input, assess a wide range of strategic alternatives, engage constructively with shareholders, and secure an outstanding transaction with a leading global renewable energy investor and operator to advance its strategy. The Circular also addresses TransAlta's recent engagement with Mangrove Partners (\"Mangrove\") and Bluescape Energy Partners (\"Bluescape\"), which have notified the Company that they intend to nominate director candidates.\nTransAlta urges shareholders to vote the Blue proxy FOR TransAlta's director nominees in order to: (i) secure a strategic $750 million investment from Brookfield Renewable Partners, a world-class renewable energy investor and operator; (ii) strengthen TransAlta's ability to advance its strategy, invest in growth and accelerate the return of capital to shareholders; and (iii) add world-class renewable energy and capacity market expertise to its Board of Directors. A copy of the Circular can be downloaded from the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and the Company's EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. The Circular is also available at TransAlta's website.\n\"Over the past several years, TransAlta has successfully developed and implemented a strategy designed to navigate fundamental regulatory changes and a weak economy in our primary market, all while delivering record free cash flow, reducing debt, and continuing to grow the Company,\" said Ambassador Gordon Giffin, Chair of the TransAlta Board. \"Securing Brookfield's investment and expertise is a continuation of that work. It responds to the feedback we have received from our shareholders and gives us everything we need to accelerate our strategy to create significant and sustainable shareholder value.\"\n\"The market has reacted very favourably to our deal with Brookfield. It has the full support of RBC Global Asset Management, TransAlta's largest shareholder with a 12.4% stake in the Company, as well as the equity research analyst community,\" Ambassador Giffin continued. \"We believe shareholders should vote the Blue proxy in favour of TransAlta's Board nominees to protect these gains and all of the strategic benefits this investment provides.\"\n\"TransAlta's shareholders have been patient and supportive as we've transformed the Company. Now they deserve to reap the rewards. We urge shareholders to move forward rather than backwards. We are poised to deliver compelling value, whereas Mangrove and Bluescape represent risk and uncertainty, at best,\" said Ambassador Giffin.\nTransAlta has successfully navigated challenging external market conditions since 2015, when the Alberta Government introduced policies to shut down coal by 2030, impose a significant carbon tax, and targeted 5,000 MW of additional renewables into an already oversupplied market. This coincided with a period of historically low power prices in Alberta, a weak Alberta economy, significant competition for new assets and weak capital market conditions.\nIn the face of these challenges, TransAlta developed a long-term strategy to create value by achieving 100% clean energy by 2025, converting 100% of its Alberta coal fleet to natural gas, unlocking the value of the Company's hydro assets, investing in long-term contracted gas and renewable projects, reducing its operating costs and maintaining a strong balance sheet. TransAlta has made progress towards each of these goals and has significantly outperformed the TSX Capped Utility index when measured on a three- and one-year basis.\nHarry Goldgut is a Vice Chair in Brookfield's Renewable Power and Infrastructure Groups. Mr. Goldgut has been responsible for the acquisition of the majority of Brookfield's renewable power assets and has played a role in the restructuring of the electricity market in Ontario as a member of the Electricity Market Design Committee and the Clean Energy Task Force.\nRichard Legault is a Vice Chair in Brookfield's Renewable Group, Vice Chair in Brookfield Asset Management and served as the CEO of Brookfield Renewable Partners until August 2015. During his 28 years at Brookfield, Mr. Legault led the development and expansion of Brookfield's renewable business in North and South America, as well as in Europe. He also served as CFO at Brookfield Asset Management from 2000 to 2001.\nRobert C. Flexon was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Dynegy Inc. from 2011 until its acquisition by Vistra Energy Corp. in April 2018. Dynegy Inc. was a U.S. independent power producer engaged in the operation of power generating facilities and listed on the NYSE. Mr. Flexon brings a wealth of skills and experience with independent power producers, thermal generation, capital markets, accounting, finance, tax and risk management.\nEach of the nominees brings exceptional and highly relevant expertise to TransAlta. The fact that Mr. Goldgut and Mr. Legault have been nominated by Brookfield as part of its cornerstone investment in the Company is a significant benefit of the transaction. TransAlta would add these two directors under any scenario, simply for their expertise and enormous knowledge of renewable energy assets and the Canadian market. The addition of Mr. Flexon further enhances our Board's strength, particularly as we execute our coal-to-gas conversion strategy.\nThese nominations continue a pattern of Board renewal at TransAlta. Including the three new nominee directors, the Board will have added eight new directors in the past five years. TransAlta notes and appreciates the positive endorsement that Bluescape Executive Chairman C. John Wilder gave in recent correspondence about the quality of the new TransAlta Board nominees.\nTogether with the three new director nominees described above, TransAlta's Board has the right mix of skills, capabilities, experience and market knowledge to provide effective oversight and direction to the Company's strategy and ongoing successful efforts to drive shareholder value creation. The Board nominees' expertise includes renewable and thermal operational capability, as well as public markets, environmental, technology, legal, regulatory, governmental affairs, engineering and technical expertise. The exceptional qualifications of our Board members have been proven through the significant leadership positions they have held as officers and/or directors at very sizable, publicly-traded companies with complex operations.\nTransAlta's Circular details the Board's extensive engagement program over the past three years with many of the Company's largest institutional shareholders. The purpose of these discussions was to gauge Shareholders' support for, and input into, our strategies and to discuss possible strategic investments, financings or other transactions or events to unlock TransAlta's value. The sum and substance of this feedback was that investors are supportive of the Company's strategy, but wanted to see more action taken to accelerate the implementation of the Company's plan. The insight gained from this engagement is one of the factors that compelled the Board to seize the opportunity to secure the Brookfield transaction when it did.\nThe Circular also describes TransAlta's relationship with Brookfield, which has been an operating partner on a BC hydro facility since 2009 and a meaningful shareholder of TransAlta for over four years. As with all of the Company's major shareholders, TransAlta has had discussions with Brookfield throughout this period on a variety of topics. Of particular note, Brookfield's recent investment was informed by extensive prior discussions and due diligence over the past three years with Brookfield (and other potential investors) aimed at a wide range of strategies for enhancing the long-term value potential of the Company's hydro and coal assets, as well as the value of the Company as a whole, including through potential sale transactions. As a result, Brookfield was very familiar with TransAlta and its hydro assets, and TransAlta knew Brookfield could be an outstanding partner to help fund and implement the Company's value creation strategy.\nTransAlta welcomes constructive shareholder engagement and has had numerous discussions with Mangrove and Bluescape since they emerged as TransAlta shareholders in recent months. In the course of these discussions, as detailed in the Circular, Mangrove and Bluescape supported Mr. Flexon as a candidate for election to the Board, and rejected an offer to also have Bluescape Executive Chairman C. John Wilder join the TransAlta Board. Mangrove and Bluescape subsequently submitted a term sheet demanding, among other things, that the Company issue to Mr. Wilder C$150 million in common shares at a 6% discount to the market price, based on a 21-day volume weighted average. This was a demand that no board could reasonably accept.\nAmbassador Giffin added, \"Had the dissidents accepted our offer, Mr. Wilder would have a seat at the Board table. Instead, they notified the Company of their intention to nominate five new directors, which suggests they are seeking the ability to terminate the Brookfield investment and implement the playbook they have used at other companies of selling renewable energy assets and doubling down on coal-fired generation, which is a dead-end strategy and something we will not do.\"\nTransAlta cautions shareholders that a potential slate of dissident nominees from Mangrove and Bluescape threatens to disrupt TransAlta's strategic direction by: (i) terminating Brookfield's investment, and all the value and expertise that comes with it; (ii) abandoning TransAlta's move towards clean energy by retrenching to coal, or to go in search of potential alternative transactions, a process that could take months or years with no assurance of producing anything of greater – or even similar – value; and (iii) adding further risk and delay to returning meaningful value to TransAlta shareholders who have supported the Company throughout its strategic transformation.\nIn a March 29, 2019 press release, Mangrove and Bluescape ask: \"Is the Brookfield Investment in the best interests of all TransAlta shareholders?\" The answer is a resounding \"yes\" – and all evidence indicates that the market agrees. In the four trading days following the announcement of the deal, TransAlta's share price increased by more than 9% and equity research analysts have published favourable commentaries and increased their consensus 12-month price target for TransAlta's stock by 24%.\nIn addition to the benefits outlined above, the investment is structured to enable TransAlta shareholders to participate in the future value of the Company's hydro assets through both the deferred sale arrangement (i.e., post 2024) and through the retention of at least 51% of the Hydro portfolio. The structure is significantly more accretive than potential alternatives, such as issuing equity at the current share price (which would dilute existing shareholders at sub-optimal value), selling an interest in the Company's coal-to-gas assets which are central to the Company's long-term strategy, or weakening the balance sheet through excess borrowing, which would inhibit the execution of TransAlta's value-creation strategy and not be in the best long-term interests of the Company or its shareholders. Furthermore, Brookfield is aligned with shareholder interests through its position as a long-standing significant investor in the Company, as well as through Board nominations and the associated fiduciary duties of its nominees to TransAlta and its shareholders. Brookfield has committed to purchase TransAlta common shares in the open market to increase its share ownership in TransAlta to 9% subject to certain conditions, and TransAlta and Brookfield will form a joint operating committee to focus on optimizing the operations and maximizing the value of the Company's hydro assets.\nAs it relates to the value of TransAlta's Hydro assets, the 13x EBITDA multiple used in the transaction to value the future cash flows from TransAlta's Hydro assets is in line with analyst estimates and is consistent with the 10x – 16.3x multiples for precedent merchant hydro transactions that involve selling 100% of the assets (whereas Brookfield will only have rights to acquire a minority interest). Higher multiples may be observed in control transactions in markets that are more liquid, more contracted based on higher capacity or power prices or more interconnected with neighbouring markets than Alberta, but that is not where TransAlta's hydro assets are located. In addition, Brookfield is paying 13x the future EBITDA in the future, after the PPA expires, when TransAlta expects the assets to generate significantly more EBITDA than they do currently. All other precedent transactions are based on current EBITDA.\nFinally, the Brookfield investment will be highly accretive for TransAlta shareholders as it will permit TransAlta to repurchase up to $250 million of shares through a substantial issuer bid and its normal course issuer bid program.\nTransAlta's single largest shareholder, RBC Global Asset Management, is supportive of our strategic partnership with, and the investment by, Brookfield. RBC has committed to vote all of the common shares under its direction or control, representing 12.4% of TransAlta's outstanding common shares, FOR the election of all of TransAlta's director nominees at the Meeting, as well as in favour of the other items of annual and special business that shareholders are being asked to consider at the upcoming Meeting.\nBrookfield, which currently owns approximately 4.9% of TransAlta's outstanding common shares, also plans to vote FOR the election of all of TransAlta's director nominees at the Meeting, as well as in favour of the other items of annual and special business that shareholders are being asked to consider at the Meeting.\nTransAlta asks shareholders to read the Circular carefully and to vote the BLUE proxy FOR all 12 TransAlta director nominees at our upcoming Meeting on April 26, 2019. Shareholder support is critical as we work to build a foundation for long-term, sustainable value creation as a leading clean energy company.\nA vote FOR TransAlta's director nominees will be a vote to realize the value of TransAlta's diverse and quality assets for decades to come, a vote for an experienced and engaged Board and a vote to share in the upside of TransAlta. Becoming a voter is fast and easy. To support TransAlta's Board, vote only your BLUE proxy or voting instruction form today.\nIf you have any questions about the Meeting, please contact Kingsdale Advisors, TransAlta's strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent, by telephone at 1-877-659-1820 (toll-free in North America) or 1-416-867-2272 (collect outside North America) or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.\nTransAlta owns, operates and develops a diverse fleet of electrical power generation assets in Canada, the United States and Australia with a focus on long-term shareholder value. We provide municipalities, medium and large industries, businesses and utility customers clean, affordable, energy efficient, and reliable power. Today, we are one of Canada's largest producers of wind power and Alberta's largest producer of hydro-electric power.

        "prompt": "In Pakist­an where litera­cy rate is to be nearly 50 per cent, many questi­on the effica­cy of digita­l media.\nKARACHI: In a country where the literacy rate is estimated at only slightly above half of the entire population and the lowest 40 per cent have less than one-fourth share in total household income, many question the efficacy of digital media as part of the marketing mix.\nBut that is the exact perception Symmetry Digital is determined to change with the launch of Digital Minds – a competition initiated by the company to inculcate the ‘digital mindset’ at grassroots level.\nThe competition, an industry initiative spanning over the next two months, targets the youth of Karachi in a bid that once the students involved in the contest graduate from universities and join the workforce, they will be able to act as catalysts for the promotion of digital marketing – a ‘smarter, cheaper and more measurable’ choice for advertisers, according to one expert.\n“The concept of digital media has been completely misunderstood in Pakistan,” said Adil Ahmed, the Chief Operating Officer of Symmetry Digital. He explained that people assume that the digital medium is restricted to the internet and fail to take into account other platforms – mobile phones, for example.\nCellular subscriptions have crossed the 99 million mark during the last financial year. “People do not realise this but the number of Facebook users in Pakistan has also increased to 2.5 million from the mere 0.25 million recorded in December 2008,” highlighted Ahmed.\nHowever, according to the man behind one of the largest digital media agencies in the country, the mindset in Pakistan has not been able to evolve beyond the traditionally accepted mediums of marketing. “Since digital marketing is not being properly taught at local universities, the market cannot move beyond a certain penetration point,” contended Ahmed.\nHe may have a point as even the handful of courses that are taught on the subject focus on e-commerce and the internet. ‘Out-of-home’ digital platforms, for instance, are unheard of in Pakistan. These include interactive LED screens and augmented digital kiosks among other innovative mechanisms to communicate with the target market.\nHence, Digital Minds aims to fill the void by offering participants the opportunity to design innovative marketing plans that are either solely based on digital media or rely on it heavily.\n“The most important aspect of digital media is the ability to target a specific market,” declared the head of online strategy at a local media group.\nMeanwhile, Ahmed termed the digital medium much more ‘measurable’ than, for example, television. “While we",
        "baseline": " are not pushing for a complete digitisation of advertising, it must be realised that a suitable marketing mix is essential to achieve the desired results,” he maintained.\nWith companies constantly seeking to cut costs, reassessing the feasibility of above-the-line advertising tools deserves merit as not only are these techniques more expensive, their results are very difficult to measure since potential customers are targeted across the board, in a blanket attempt to capture attention.\nAlthough there exists tremendous potential to capitalise on demographic data collected through digital interfaces, Ahmed pointed out that many companies in Pakistan have not made the effort to boost sales by tracking behavioural characteristics or psychographics.\n“It is estimated by many that less than two per cent of the entire advertising expenditure is incurred on online campaigns – although there is no empirical research to back this figure,” he concluded.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, September 25th, 2010.\nMedia insiders expect cut-throat competition in the English print media market.",

        "prompt": "Broadcom this week announced new chips designed to create a low-cost 802.11n wireless LAN edge for the enterprise, without the need for separate WLAN controllers.\nThe two highly integrated chips are designed for 11n access points that will cost about the same as today's enterprise 11a/b/g devices, and for an edge switch that can handle both wireless and wired clients, eliminating the conventional controller-based architecture that is the foundation of most WLANs today.\nThis trend toward a unified edge switch for wireless and wired clients has been talked about for more than two years but has gained little traction. The development was sparked by emerging silicon products from Broadcom, SiNett and Marvel, and by software from NextHop (since acquired by U4EA). D-Link introduced a unified edge switch in May 2008 based on the NextHop code running on Marvel chips.\nThe premise is that by collapsing separate wired and wireless networks into one at the edge, enterprise IT gains by simplifying network deployments, operations and management, and by lowering both capital costs and total cost of ownership.\nThe new Broadcom chips come at time when two key developments are intersecting. First, 802.11n, with 300Mbps data rates per radio, is moving into large-scale enterprise deployments, offering 5- to 8-times the throughput of 802.11b/g networks. Second, some enterprises that have deployed wall-to-wall WLANs are now discovering that most of their existing -- and expensive -- wired ports are lying idle, as end users rely almost completely on the WLAN for network access. This trend is triggering intense debate, as the reader comments about our recent story on this trend make clear.\nBroadcom's BCM4748 chip supports a 2x2 MIMO configuration for 802.11n access points, using the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and running with standard 802.3af power over Ethernet. It's designed as a \"system on a chip\" and integrates all the 802.11n components, along with Broadcom's enhancements to create a more robust signal, with the latest MIPS32 533MHz processing core, a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC controller, on-board SRAM, 802.1x and WPA and WPA2 for enterprise-class security, USB 2.0 host ports, and power amplifiers.\nUsing the new chip, manufacturers can slash the overall bill-of-material costs by 30% to 35%, says Michael Powell, senior product line manger for Broadcom's enterprise switching group. \"What we're really look at are [final] cost points for dual-concurrent 11",
        "baseline": "n access points that are similar to those for dual-concurrent, enterprise 11a/b/g access points today,\" he says. He cites market research data as putting those list prices in the $300 to 400 range, with comparable 11n access points considerably more expensive.\nThe new unified switch silicon is the BCM56520, which supports CAPWAP tunneling to attached WLAN access points, and up to 28 Gigabit Ethernet ports, or 24 such ports and four Broadcom HiGig ports (which support Broadcom's protocol for high-capacity interconnections with other Broadcom systems). It's about the same price as the previous chip but with far greater capacity to handle 11n data rates, according to Powell.\nThe package also includes the latest version of Broadcom's FastPath Unified Wireless Switching systems software.\nThe products are sampling now with equipment makers, who could introduce access points and switches based on them by the end of 2009 and into 2010.",

BECKENBAUER STORY: Franz Beckenbauer, who headed Germany's 2006 World Cup organising committee, said on Monday (October 26) a transfer of 6.7 million euros to world soccer's governing body FIFA in 2005 was a mistake but rejected claims it was a return of a loan to buy votes in favour of the country's World Cup bid. In a brief statement sent to media, the former World Cup-winning player and coach, who is a key figure in an affair involving an alleged slush fund used to bribe FIFA voting members back in 2000 to award the tournament to Germany, again said the Germans never bought votes. \"In order to get a subsidy from FIFA (for the organisation of the 2006 World Cup) those involved went ahead with a proposal from the FIFA finance commission that in today's eyes should have been rejected. I, as President of the then organising committee bear the responsibility of this mistake.\" But he said any claims of a votes-for-cash deal were not true. \"There were no votes bought in order to get the nod for the 2006 World Cup,\" Beckenbauer, 70, said. Der Spiegel magazine had reported an alleged slush fund of 6.7 million euros was used to buy votes for Germany. The money had been provided by then Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the magazine said. The German Football Association (DFB) has rejected the claims as groundless but has said it",

When asked why the Germans have to pay FIFA a small sum to unlock a payment for them that was much larger, Niersbach, a vice-president of the organising committee back in 2005, said he did not know. Der Spiegel claims the 2005 payment to FIFA was repaying Louis-Dreyfus for his loan five years earlier through the soccer body.

        "prompt": "File photo of ISIS militants.\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS)'s affiliate in Libya lost control of its eastern stronghold of Derna after tensions with a local Islamist militia escalated into violent conflict on June 9, 2015. Gunmen from ISIS allegedly assassinated Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade (ASMB) leader Nasser al-Aker, who was a senior member of the al-Qaeda-associated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).\nThe Mujahedeen Shura Council of Derna (MSC Derna), an umbrella group controlled by ASMB, released a statement declaring jihad on ISIS in Derna soon after the assassination. Clashes erupted across the city. Anti-ISIS forces cleared ISIS from central Derna and captured ISIS's headquarters on June 13, despite ISIS's defensive deployment of multiple SVBIEDs. ISIS now holds no territory inside the city.\nSocial media reports from activists within Derna indicate strong local animosity towards ISIS. Derna's residents organized demonstrations against ISIS on June 11 and 12, and according to unconfirmed rumors may have been armed by ASMB to participate in military operations against ISIS.\nAfter ISIS's expulsion, MSC Derna released statements announcing the reopening of a hospital, the creation of a program to return stolen cars, and plans for a municipal council, likely in an attempt to replace ISIS's governance efforts. This development demonstrates the ability of local groups likely to capitalize on discontent within ISIS's areas of control to undermine the organization.\nISIS's expulsion is especially striking because Derna contains historically strong extremist networks, some of which have ties to ISIS. Records captured from ISIS's predecessor al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2007 revealed that Derna contributed more foreign fighters per capita to AQI than any other city.\nDerna natives associated with ISIS in Syria returned to Libya in 2014 and formed the Majlis Shura Shabab al-Islam group, which later took control of Derna. These militants administered sharia law, conducted public executions, and provided basic services in all areas of the city. The group publicly declared its allegiance to ISIS's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October 2014, and ISIS recognized it as an official affiliate in November 2014.\nISIS is executing a coherent global strategy that involves defending its territory within Iraq and Syria, establishing affiliates within the Middle East and North Africa, and encouraging terror attacks in the wider world.\nISIS's regional affiliates, or wilayats, allow the organization to claim success even when it suffers losses within Iraq and Syria. ISIS also uses its regional affiliates to exacerbate local and regional conflicts in order to facilitate the organization's expansion beyond Iraq and Syria in the long term.\nISIS's regional efforts have been most successful in Libya, where the group controls terrain, administers governance, and operates militant training camps. ISIS's leadership now encourages fighters who cannot travel to Iraq and Syria to fight in Libya instead.\nISIS seeks to exacerbate the Libyan conflict and seize terrain where Libya's rival governments are unable to prevent the group's expansion. The organization's campaign includes explosive attacks on prominent targets, strikes on oil infrastructure, and sustained guerilla warfare to fix adversaries in major cities. ISIS also takes advantage of the disorder within Libya to seize terrain through conventional maneuver operations, most recently near the city of Sirte on Libya's central coast.\nISIS firing from a captured US Humvee.\nISIS's presence in Derna appears unlinked to its military offensives in central and western Libya, making the loss of the city unlikely to interrupt those operations. However, the development indicates that ISIS may face challenges in establishing social control in Libya in the long term, given its brutal methodology and intolerance of other armed groups.\nISIS's recent loss suggests that the group failed to cultivate support in Derna. This failure may be due in part to ISIS's inability to provoke mobilization on sectarian grounds as it has done in Iraq and Syria, since Libya has",
        "baseline": " a Sunni majority population. It is also likely a result of ISIS's inability to cooperate with other militant organizations.\nThis latter vulnerability may impair ISIS's efforts in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, all areas characterized by increasing disorder and competition amongst multiple armed groups. ISIS's leadership acknowledged the challenge of indigenous opposition in a speech on June 23, 2015, specifically warning anti-ISIS forces within Syria and Libya to cease targeting the group.\nISIS likely will continue to execute military operations in order to seize terrain within Libya. ISIS controls Sirte entirely, and may attempt to launch an offensive on the valuable oilfields southeast of the city. ISIS also maintains a presence in Benghazi, and likely will continue to launch explosive attacks on Tripoli and Misrata.\nISIS's increased rhetoric against local enemies since the loss of Derna suggests that the organization's friction with local groups likely will persist, however. This uncompromising stance may chronically undermine ISIS's efforts to expand and govern in the Middle East and North Africa.",

        "prompt": "It's officially time to question the process when it comes to Markelle Fultz, Sixers fans.\nWhile Joel Embiid is an All-Star starter, Ben Simmons is the frontrunner for Rookie of the Year and Dario Saric is averaging 14 points and seven rebounds, Fultz seemingly still can't shoot a basketball.\nThe 2017 No. 1 pick continues to struggle with his revised jump shot as he deals with a right shoulder issue that has caused him to miss all but the first four games of the season.\nVideo of Fultz shooting from the free-throw line during the Sixers' practice Wednesday morning circulated on Twitter that afternoon. In the video, Fultz can be seen going three-for-four at the line, including one shot that clanks the front of the rim and gets a friendly roll and a miss that is well right and barely hits the rim at all.\nHowever, even more worrisome than the miss is the ugly shooting form. Fultz still has a noticeable hitch as he jerks on his release -- an issue that has plagued the rookie since preseason.\nThe ugly jumper has been noticeable for weeks and Fultz doesn't appear to be any closer to fixing it.\nFultz's ugly shooting form is a stark contrast to his jumper while at Washington. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 23.2 points on 47.6% shooting from the field and 41% from three-point range in his lone collegiate season.\nIn his four games played with the Sixers, Fultz shot just 33% from the field and 50% from the free-throw line. He did not attempt a three-pointer.\nThe issue of Fultz's broken jump shot initially stems from shoulder soreness the rookie first experienced in preseason. Fultz's agent told reporters the point guard received a cortisone shot in his right shoulder in early October. Since then, the Sixers have been working on fixing his shooting mechanics. Nearly four months later and it appears the problem with his jumper is still nowhere near to being resolved.\nSixers coach Brett Brown didn't exactly give the most optimistic outlook when it comes to Fultz's broken jumper.\n\"I",
        "baseline": "'m old, and I've never experienced anything like this,\" Brown told Sportsradio 94WIP last week.\nThe Sixers traded the No. 3 overall pick and a future first-round choice to the Celtics to select Fultz with the No. 1 overall pick. The Celtics went on to take Jayson Tatum with the No. 3 pick. He's averaging 13.5 points and 5.5 rebounds and has started every game this season.\nPhilly doesn't exactly have the best resume when it comes to star players dealing with injuries early on in their careers. Embiid missed the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons due to a broken foot and a setback in his recovery. Embiid then only appeared in 34 games his rookie season last year due to a number of injuries, including a torn meniscus in his left knee. In addition to Embiid, Simmons missed all of last season after suffering a fractured foot that took longer than expected to properly heal.",

That will happen if I take them back, I know it because it is the culture of my family. They believe in it and I will not be able to do anything.\n\"It happened to me and I don't want my daughters to go through the same thing.\"\nThe campaign backing Saliu's right to remain in the UK has grown rapidly over the past 48 hours, with the number of people signing a petition on change.org/afusat exceeding 100,000 by Thursday afternoon.\nSaliu, who has been supported by friends in Leeds, in particular by Anj Handa, who lodged the petition, said she was overwhelmed by the support of friends and members of the public who did not know her.\n\"I am so happy for this support. It has made me stronger and it has given me hope.\"\nSaliu said: \"Every woman should stand up for her children and do whatever is necessary to protect them from something like this.\"\nSaliu said she fled Nigeria in 2011 after her stepmother told her she would get her oldest daughter, Bassy, cut. She says her parents were also forcing her to marry a man 40 years her senior, who she believed also posed a risk to her children.\nShe first applied for asylum in 2012 but it was denied. An appeal has been dismissed and her recent application to the Home Office presenting new evidence was rejected on Wednesday.\nLeeds North West MP Greg Mulholland and the campaigner against FGM Leyla Hussein, have also both backed her fight against deportation.\nMulholland said: \" I was very concerned to hear about the treatment that Ms Saliu has received from the Home Office, and I have written to the [UK Border Agency] and requested that they urgently investigate Ms Saliu's case and ensure that the deportation is put on hold until",
        "baseline": " the matter has been thoroughly looked at again and to allow Afusat and her supporters to submit fresh evidence about the problems she and her children would face if they are returned to Nigeria.\n\"It is extremely worrying that the Home Office are trying to deport her to Nigeria, despite the threat of violence she faces, and the threat of FGM to her two young daughters, which sadly Afusat has already been a victim of.\"The Home Office indicated the deportation would go ahead. While the Guardian was filming Saliu she received a phone call saying she would be deported on Friday. Saliu's supporters indicated that she would abide by the legal process and make her way to Heathrow.\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim for asylum on its individual merits. We believe that those who fail to establish a genuine fear of persecution should return home voluntarily. If they do not, we will enforce their removal.\"",
