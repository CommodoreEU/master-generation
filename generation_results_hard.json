        "prompt": "I have no problem with that. Special interests with a dog in the hunt in virtually any controversial legislation will beat a sponsor's door down to effect the language that tumbles through the committee process. It's absolutely a public service to shine a light on who's pitching policy that could become state law.\nBut we in the media should do it fairly. Do the same homework, apply the same standards to lobbyists on all sides of the issue. If Ceballos had done that, I would be commending her now.\nI'm referring to Ceballos' blind faith in the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\nApparently without checking out the Southern Poverty Law Center's reputation or its long fall from grace, she set this organization as The Authority on hate groups. In truth, though, she's not the only journalist to blindly trust this organization.\nThe SPLC, which enjoys a sterling reputation in the press as a serious and knowledgeable authority on bigotry and extremism in the U.S., does this to great effect with sleek gimmicks such as its infamous “hate maps” and “hate lists,” all of which are shared widely by an extremely eager, fawning news media.\"\nI wish she'd first Googled SPLC, which The New Yorker magazine refers to as \"a highly profitable scam.\"\nWhich constitutional law attorney J. Matt Barber calls in Renew America, \"corrupt to its core.\"\nWhich The Washington Examiner calls \"a scam\" and describes its business model as centering \"entirely around keeping donors in a state of constant, wallet-opening panic.\nThough always left of center, the Southern Poverty Law Center once had a reputation as a fairly objective civil rights group. Founded by direct-marketing millionaire Morris Dees and partner Joseph Levin Jr. in 1971, the SPLC made important and honorable contributions to many of the historic civil rights gains of the 20th Century. According to its own materials, the SPLC was \"internationally known for tracking and exposing the activities of hate groups.\"\nBut its lofty purpose crumbled more than 20 years ago as it transformed into a machine for raising money and launching left-wing political attacks. Dees perfected his money-raising skills by fearmongering with manufactured hate, labeling more and more nonviolent Christian right organizations hate groups, and as the lawsuits against him piled up. Lately the Center has become more of a threat to free speech and civil debate than a defender of the weak or a foe of violent extremism.\nKen Silverstein, writing for Harper's Magazine, addressed this untoward metamorphosis in 2000: \"Today's SPLC spends most of its time -- and money -- on a relentless fund-raising campaign, peddling memberships in the church of tolerance with all the zeal of a circuit rider passing the collection plate. ... The American Institute of Philanthropy gives the Center one of the worst ratings of any group it monitors.\"\nIt doesn't bother me that the NSF reporter uses negative terms like \"hard-line\" and \"controversial\" to describe groups like the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR. But it does strike me as profoundly unfair that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has labeled these \"hate groups\" for no good reason I can find, gets no reality check. None at all.\nPresumably? That's a lot of presuming.\nThe bottom line here is, it's inappropriate for the media to continually cite SPLC as an authoritative source on hate without acknowledging its progressive agenda and conflation of extremist groups with mainstream ones.\nPlease Google the Southern Poverty Law Center for yourself.\nThe SPLC had a good, highly profitable scam going on while it lasted as evidenced by their impressive bankroll, however I think reality has caught up with these fraudsters. They will have to spend a considerable amount of that capital to try and buy back their credibility.\nThe SPLC has become a hate group over the years which needs to be de-funded and pushed to the toilet status of society much like the KKK.\nThis is so silly. The SPLC is a shell of what it used to be and stood for. They have lost relevancy in contemporary and has, in my opinion, zero credibility in what they say and do. They lost their moral authority years ago and integrity as well. Anyone who hitches their wagon to the SPLC now-a-days must be desperate on several levels.\nThere's no more \"hate\" among the people that support the SPLC and the work it does than is evidenced on Sean Hannity's Fox News TV program every night ... EVERY NIGHT!\nSo then, STOP WATCHING HANNITY \"Chuckles\"!\nWell, Breezy, I stopped paying any serious attention to Fox News years ago when I realized it was nothing more than a propaganda tool that Murdoch and Ailes were using to advance their rightwingnut political agenda. Hannity is a disaffected former roofer simply spewing his peculiar variety of hate and venom for a lot of money. There are a couple of other nutcases appearing there regularly who are just as bad as Hannity.\nSo I suppose this newsletter and your readers are experts on the subject of hate groups. These letters confirm you are not an expert on the subject. You are part of the problem at this point.\nThe SPLC has long been an activist arm of the left, on par with Media Matters, Now a number of the members of its leadership have been pushed out for the very type of intolerance they supposedly were fighting against. It is a sham outfit.\nTHE WALL: The Border Patrol, DHS, ICE our Military & the Army Corps of Engineers have all endorsed the need for a wall numerous times almost nightly. Barrack Obama’s own border patrol chief, Mark Morgan, has repeatedly stated that walls work. They free up resources to focus on the points of entrances so they can detect more contraband and illegals. TPS / DACA To Democrats/Progressives/Socialists (whats the difference?) programs like Temporary Protective Status (TPS) or Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals (DACA) are permanent programs. There is nothing \"temporary or deferred\" about these programs to Democrats. These programs are designed to admit refugees (usually from the third world) then Democrats fight to keep them here permanently using the charge of racism, religion, guilt against anyone opposed. Simple formula works great. THE PRICE: Democrats view U.S. citizens as acceptable collateral damage to their future long range goals of flooding the country with refugees & illegal aliens and having taxpayers paying the cost. Democrat politicians and their voters have put families at risk of being victimized by illegal aliens as in the cases Kate Steinly (nothing done) then, Mollie Tibbetts, (nothing done) Police Cpl. Ronil Singh, (nothing done) now Bambi Larson; butchered in her home, nothing will be done...who's next? These victims would be alive today if our border was secured. Most of these killers have been deported numerous times. Bambi 's killer claimed \"amnesty\" to get into the country. Sanctuary city's where you have protection for illegal aliens, gang members, illegal alien felons fleeing ICE. What a place to raise a family. Google search \"illegal alien crime\" or \"victims.\" Preventable victimization's. THE STAMPEDE: Democrats offer rewards, incentives so.....More caravans on the way. The current migration at our border is costing U.S taxpayers a Kings ransom. Fleeing persecution? or fleeing for freebies? they sure don't stay in Mexico when they reach \"safety\" or ask or offered political asylum in Mexico. Why? because Mexico will give them NOTHING. So they make the long journey to our border, our generous Democrats, and our tax dollars. Notice how many have made the long, difficult, dangerous journey to our country 8-9 months pregnant? Give birth on American soil and the U.S. taxpayers will not only pay for the birth of you're child but will also give you state government assistance.\nThe \"Southern Poverty Law Center\" is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for ANY American to be proud of,.. and the word \"sham\" doesn't come anywhere near the lowest description that SHOULD be applied to this despicable organization,... that gives the word \"Southern\" a distasteful connotation..!\nI'm only trying to counterbalance morons like you \"Fart\", who give Florida a bad name that makes everyone think \"It must be something in water that creates so much subnormal intelligence down there..\"\nIn many, many ways, and for a long time, \"southern\" has carried a \"distasteful connotation\", historically, politically, and socially.\nThe SPLC is a disgraceful bunch of haters sponsored by leftists. Look at their list of Christian organizations and people like k.Ali who tells the truth about Islam and Sharia. Worse is the media platforms that depend on their \"lists\". UnAmerican and anti free speech.\nThat's a poem that was written and then put on a plaque years after the writer died because friends of the writer what to memorialize the writer. The only thing actually written on the statue is JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.\nDon't HAVE a dictionary, huh?\nExtreme \"nationalism\" is the foundation of fascism.\nAnd the Democrat party is the foundation of the KKK.\nDemocratic party of 100 yrs.\nOf the 1,020 “hate groups” claimed on the SPLC’s “Hate Map” for 2018, fully 322 are marked only as \"statewide,\" meaning that the SPLC provides no corroborating information, not even a known city or town, let alone any kind of membership headcount, that a journalist, researcher or donor could use to verify the company's claims. That’s 32% of the alleged total right off the top, or almost one-in-three. We just get to take the SPLC's word for it that these \"groups\" are really, really out there with no evidence whatsoever. That's not good enough, and it certainly isn't good journalism. Big claims demand big proof, or any proof, for that matter.

By contrast, the company lists 22 Black \"hate groups,\" none of which are \"statewide.\" SPLC \"hate group\" numbers are for fundraising, not for fact finding.\nOnly wish you would use your considerable talents to addressing the extreme groups spewing hate against African-Americans; our Jewish, Catholic and Islamic faith communities; and others. They are vastly more dangerous than the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nTrue ... and ESPECIALLY in the south!\nI checked up on the hate group in my area. It is one \"Christian\", and I use that term loosely, that hate Jewish people. Guess he forgot that Jesus and his disciples were Jewish.

The latest report provides loan quality findings for mortgages reviewed by ACES Audit Technology(TM) during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2017 as well as the 2017 calendar year (CY).\n* The distribution of critical defects shifted significantly from 2016 to 2017.\n\"In 2016, the categories containing the majority of critical defects reflected the industry's reaction to TRID, which had been implemented at the end of 2015,\" said Phil McCall, president of ARMCO. \"In 2017, we see a shift away from those categories, toward the types of defects that align with the industry's move to a purchase-driven market.\"\nIn 2017, the majority of critical defects centered around issues associated with core underwriting and eligibility issues, which is reflective of the deeper complexity of purchase transactions, as compared to refinances.\nThe Q4/CY 2017 ARMCO Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report is based on nationwide post-closing quality control loan data from over 90,000 unique loans selected for random full-file reviews, as was captured by the company's ACES Analytics benchmarking software. Defects listed in the report are categorized using the Fannie Mae loan defect taxonomy.\nEach ARMCO Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report includes easy-to-read charts and graphs, a summary that outlines ARMCO's overall findings, a breakdown of defect rates for each Fannie Mae loan defect category, and a short conclusion. ARMCO issues a one-year analysis for the calendar year with each fourth quarter Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report.\n\"When you see how much the issues that impact quality can change quarter to quarter and year over year, it becomes apparent why lenders should use the most current data for strategies going forward,\" said McCall. \"ARMCO provides the Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report for free because we want to arm all lenders with as many tools as possible to achieve quality in the most efficient way possible.\"\nTo obtain a copy of the report, please visit https://www.",

        "prompt": "Remember the infamous scene in Speed where a bus jumps a fifty foot gap in an elevated freeway? Of course you do, because every physics teacher from that day on illustrated that moment as something that could never, ever happen. Although the freeway was elevated, the bus was careening down a flat section. It would have fallen down from the edge of the freeway the same way a ball rolling off the edge of a table would. Gravity doesn't care if you're going very fast. What's more, since the front section of the bus moved off the freeway first, it would have started falling while the back section of the bus was still being supported. This would have sent the bus into a spin, and if the fall were long enough it would have tumbled end over end into the ground.\nBuses don't generally inhabit regions where they can go tumbling end over end, but animals do, and the more likely they are to slip, to jump, or to go into free fall, the more likely they are to have tails. A group of UC Berkeley scientists took a look at this, especially the way leaping lizards use their tails to control their falls and their jumps. The lizards bring their tails up towards their own backs at first, this forces their upper body up and back towards the tail, letting them reach up higher. Later, when lizards notice that they may have overshot their goal, they curl their tails forward and under their bodies, forcing their upper bodies forward and",

They made a little toy car, gave it a tail, and put it on a ramp. At first, when the tail was loose and uncontrolled, the car did just what the bus should have done. Its front end dipped and it went into a spin downwards. By forcing its tail up and forward, it forces the front of its move up and back. The car keeps its front end up and prevents a spinning fall.\nWe imagine the robots of the future as bipedal humanoids. Perhaps that's being speciesist. Maybe the fantastic machines of the future will look like gigantic lizard-men, hopping robo-kangaroos, climbing robot rhesus-monkeys, and long-tailed, perfectly steady off-road vehicles.",

The tail of the kangaroo rat can be brought up and over it's own back, and the tail of the sugar glider can be brought up and over it's own head. The tail of the sugar glider is also flexible enough to curl around a tree branch, allowing the sugar glider to be carried by the branch as it moves from tree to tree.

During takeoff, the tail is the last thing to fall, giving the lizard time to snap it up to the back and get a proper grip on the ground.\nThe use of the tail in the lizards' jumps and falls may be the most obvious and most common of its uses, but it's not the only one. Many of the lizards that the scientists studied also use their tails to help them negotiate their way through complex environments. For example, a lizard that is trying to get through the branches of a tree will pull its tail back and forth between the branches, using it to help it negotiate its way through the branches.

To prevent themselves from being dashed to pieces, lizards will curl their tails up and over their bodies. In the same way that you can keep a toothpick from breaking by bending it up and over a table surface instead of allowing gravity force the end down, lizards use their tails to keep their bodies intact.\nThis isn't the only reason for tails, and it can certainly get boring talking about what they are good at all the time.

        "prompt": "Are you willing to go into debt for love? If you are ready to pop the question, but haven’t saved for the ring you want to buy, you may be tempted to finance the purchase. But do that, and you may find that already pricey engagement ring costs a lot more than you planned.\nThe average engagement ring cost $5,200 and about 12% of couples spent more than $8,000 for an engagement ring, according to the XO Group Inc. 2011 Engagement Engagement & Jewelry Survey. The average ring was 1 carat for the center stone, and 1.4 carats total stones.\nIf you haven’t socked that much away, don’t worry. All of the major jewelry stores offer financing, with many of them promoting interest-free financing for six to 12 months. (No interest, no payments is no longer allowed thanks to the CARD Act.) But there’s a catch: Miss a payment or fail to pay off the balance and you’ll pay a lot more.\nFor example, here is what some of the major jewelry stores are currently advertising*. With all of these plans, if you make one late payment or fail to pay the balance in full during the promotional period, interest will be charged from the date of purchase -- not from the date the promotional period ends.\nJared: 0% interest if paid in full within 12 months; up to 24.99%.\nKay Jewelers: 0% interest if paid in full within 12 months; up to 24.99%.\nWhile interest-free financing may work out fine if you are able to pay off the balance, it is risky if you aren’t able to come up with the cash to pay it off.\nOne more potential trap: Applying for one of the accounts will create an inquiry on your credit reports. Plus, if you accept the financing, you’ll have a new account with a balance listed on your credit reports, and that could potentially have a negative effect on your credit scores. That’s something to keep in mind if you hope to buy a home together soon, for example.\nBuy a less expensive ring and start saving for an upgrade on, say, your fifth or tenth wedding anniversary.\nUse interest-free financing for the initial purchase, then use a low-rate balance transfer to pay off the balance before the 0% store financing ends. I am not recommending this, since you can run into traps here too, but if you pull it off, it’s better than paying 25% or more for long-term store financing.\nGet a part-time job in a jewelry store and save substantially on your purchase. Put all of your earnings toward a ring.\nBuy Shy and Save: Shop for diamonds that weigh just under certain weight thresholds. For example, if you want a 1.0 carat diamond, you can buy a .90 carat diamond and save more than $1,000. And buying shy will hardly affect the diamond’s outward appearance (the diameter of a 1.0 carat diamond is 6.5 mm, whereas the diameter of a .90 shy carat stone is 6.3 mm -- the difference is the thickness of a piece of paper). The price difference between a 1.90 carat diamond and a 2.0 carat diamond can be as much as $5,000!\nHit the Internet: There can be some great deals found on the Internet -- i.e. BlueNile and Union Diamond allow you to compare the going rate of loose diamonds and ring settings based on their grades and styles",

Most jewelry ads are selling you on settings, not diamonds, even though the stone is a whopping 90 percent of a ring’s cost.

Never settle on the sticker price unless you’ve shopped around and you know it’s already a fair price.\nKeep one more thing in mind before going into debt for an engagement ring: You’ve got a much bigger expense coming up soon -- a wedding.\n*This information may have changed from the date of publication.

        "prompt": "It is still very early days to be making such an assumption, but the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch mosque massacres looks like being a somewhat different beast to previous probes accorded that high-level status.\nThe commission’s hearings and findings are likely to amount to much-needed catharsis — and not just for the members of the Muslim community, most of whom will still be stunned by the tragedy.\nMany of them will also be heaped in guilt for having survived the onslaught on everything they hold dear, be that faith, family or whatever.\nAt this point, it should be emphasised that this Royal Commission will not be unique in being a vehicle that brings “closure”— to borrow that tired, overused and consequently devalued term.\nIt would have been the hope of all New Zealanders at the time that the Royal Commission into the crash of one of the national airline’s DC-10 passenger jets in the Antarctic would bring closure to the families, relatives and friends of the 257 passengers and crew who perished in that calamity some four decades ago.\nIt didn’t. That inquiry instead brought angst, anguish and argument.\nIt will be hoped the current Royal Commission into Historical Abuse in State Care and in the Care of Faith-based Institutions will bring some kind of closure for those who spent time in those homes where things horrid were a fact of daily life.\nThose two examples are evidence of something else, however. It is usually the case that the great bulk of the populace is several steps removed from the subject matter under investigation by a Royal Commission.\nWhat makes the inquiry into the events of March 15 different is that they cut about as close to the bone figuratively-speaking as it is possible to get.\nEveryone feels wounded by the atrocity; everyone is struggling to understand how someone could become so devoid of humanity.\nThe inquiry offers a forum for the nation as a whole to confront these demons which — judging from some of the copy-cat behaviour of recent days — lurk not that far below the surface of New Zealand’s at times rather dysfunctional society.\nWithout such a mechanism providing the means to purge and cleanse the national soul, the country will be tempted to keep looking back as much as it wishes to march forwards.\nAdmittedly — and thankfully — the near unanimity displayed by Parliament in tightening up New Zealand’s up-till-now woefully-lax gun control laws has begun the healing the deep wound to the nation’s psyche.\nShame on David Seymour for failing to realise that. Let it be forever on his conscience that when the call came to put the national interest ahead of his party’s interest, he was found wanting.\nLet’s forget about the Act Party, however. Everyone else has.\nThe Royal Commission is countless times more important.\nIt is essential that the country is provided with some mechanism to examine and thus understand how someone could do something so evil.\nThe Commission’s terms of reference, unveiled by the Prime Minister last Monday, guarantee that will happen.\nMuch of the Commission’s resources will be devoted to unearthing every element of the alleged killer’s life which might help to explain what motivated him. Also under investigation will be any links to groups within or outside New Zealand. Without answers, then closure is not possible.\nNeither can closure be found by simply ignoring the alleged mass murderer.\nThat was pretty much the stance adopted by the Prime Minister in the immediate aftermath of the shooting spree.\nIt was the wrong stance.\nJacinda Ardern’s vow that no-one would ever again hear her utter the name of the alleged killer might have been just the kind of evocative and passionate response that circumstances demanded at that time.\nThat statement also amounted to a kind of retaliatory move made on behalf of all New Zealanders expressed in the most civilised, yet firmest of tones.\nShe then implored others to similarly “speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them”.\nThat plea flowed from her view that one of the prime things that the alleged gunman had been seeking from the slaughter of innocents at the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre was notoriety.\nNot mentioning his name would thus deny him that notoriety he was craving.\nIt is within Ardern’s prerogative to hold such an opinion.\nHowever, she appears to have been influenced by the growing calls in the United States for those committing mass shootings not to be named in order to deprive them of recognition and fame.\nIt is claimed some shootings might have been prevented if such “incentives” were removed and that the shooters should be as unrecognised in their deaths as they were in their lives.\nIt is argued that media coverage increases the frequency of mass shootings just as the detailing of suicides boosts the numbers of people resorting to taking their own lives.\nThe trouble with that line of argument is that there is not a thread of scientific evidence to verify such a causal link.\nIn the Christchurch case, moreover, the shooter chose not to follow the standard script which would have had him bringing about his death by his own hand or being cut down in hail of bullets fired by the police.\nThe sense of closure that would have been provided by his death has thus been denied both the Muslim community and the wider populace.\nHis intention may be to have himself put on trial in order to promote his ideology from the platform of the High Court. The moment he tries to do so, however, he would be silenced by the presiding judge.\nHe may well be silenced. But the blunt truth is that the genie of notoriety is out of the bottle.\nWhen someone is facing 50 charges of murder",

What happened must never happen again.\nWithout being able to see how the pieces in the jigsaw which make that individual what he is, we will never understand the how and why.\nWithout that understanding then make no mistake we risk it all happening again.",

In the past year, she has been featured in articles by The New York Times, ABC.com and MSN Money.\nAt first, saving money was the driving force behind most of her purchasing decisions.

Two House lawmakers who are allies of President Donald Trump are set to meet with top intelligence officials Thursday as Trump has raised new suspicions about the federal investigation that is looking into his campaign.\nDonald Trump is catching holy hell for doubting the sagacity of our \"Intelligence Community.\" The ingrate president fails to appreciate all that the CIA, NSA, DIA and so forth have done to safeguard us from foreign perfidy.\nWhy, if the CIA hadn't made the wise call it did on WMD in Iraq, we might have become bogged down in a quagmire war there and in Afghanistan.\nA bipartisan CIA chief, appointed by President Clinton and retained by President George W. Bush, declared it a \"slam dunk\" that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had squirreled away stocks of chemical and biological weaponry.\nThe Intelligence Community chorus chimed in with \"high confidence\" that Iraq was indeed chock-o-block with such nefarious armaments.\nThink what might have befallen our nation had our myriad intelligence agencies been even a little bit less omniscient than they were.\nWhy, heavens to Betsy, we might still have troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, even to this day! Why, hells bells, there might even have been a coordinated terrorist attack on New York and Washington!\n….Uh, hold on here. Arms are waving frantically in the back of the room. What's that you say? The Intelligence Community was wrong, dead wrong, about WMD?\nAnd they totally missed those coordinated attacks on New York and Washington?\nWell then, um, never mind. Let's move on.\nAt least our Intelligence Community was on the ball regarding other momentous developments.\nThey gave us a heads-up notice that North Korea, India and Pakistan were on the verge of becoming nuclear-armed nations, right?\nAnd the agencies tipped us off that an Islamic revolution was about to seize power in Iran and that NATO ally Turkey was trending toward militantly Islamic rule.\nAnd they let us know in advance that the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc would soon collapse.\n….Wait, arms are waving again in the back of the room. The Intelligence agencies made none of those calls, you say?\nUh, um, well, let's keep moving on.\nAt least our crack intelligence agencies were on the money regarding other trends.\nThey were able, were they not, to foresee and thwart the rise of ISIS in Syria; the overrunning of the American diplomatic compound in Libya, thereby saving American lives; the chaotic Shia vs. Sunni feuding in post-Saddam Iraq, and the rise of Chavismo in Venezuela?\nMost impressive of all, didn't our intelligence agencies act alertly on information Russia provided us, thereby averting a bloody terrorist scene at the Boston Marathon?\n….There go those arms waving away in the back of the room again. The myopic cartoon character Mr. Magoo could have done a better job at detecting threats, you say?\nOkay, okay. Got it. Nobody's perfect. Even Tom Brady calls the wrong play in the huddle every now and then.\nBesides, aren't there likely other examples where our intelligence agencies courageously took successful measures under dangerous circumstances -- examples that can't be divulged for national security reasons?\nMaybe so. Let's hope, anyway.\nYet it's surely a wise approach to keep in mind that \"assessments\" submitted by the CIA, NSA, DIA, etc., are not like the stone tablets Moses lugged down from Mount Sinai. They're something short of being the word of God.\nIf old Diogenes were to take up his lantern today and resume his search for the elusive honest man, he could skip over the likes of James Clapper, former Nation Intelligence director, and John Brennan, former CIA director.\nThe two are tellers of gross whoppers. And they're inept prevaricators in the bargain.\nAs for Brennan, when confronted with evidence the agency had spied on a Senate committee with CIA oversight authority, he lyingly replied: \"Let me assure you\" the CIA \"in no way\" did any such thing.\nThe CIA IG concluded otherwise. Brennan told a big, fat, knowing, willful, felonious lie.\nYet the Clapper/Brennan whoppers go unprosecuted, even as Robert Mueller's inquisition indicts others for far less egregious falsehoods involving far less significant matters.\nMeanwhile, the Swamp continues to be pretty much ruled by a leakocracy -- especially that portion of the Swamp where the Intelligence Community dwells.\nThe leakers and leakees tend to move in the same Swamp social circles, tend to be habitues of the same Georgetown salons and soirees, tend to collect fees for being talking heads on the same cable shows.\nLeaks can be either a blessing or a curse. They can expose and thwart abuses of power. Or they can help advance abuses of power, often -- as with the Intelligence Community -- by misdirecting attention away from dubious activity and redirecting attention toward vaguely defined \"threats.\"\nAs has long been well known around the Swamp, there are no leakers more adroitly self-serving than those of the Intelligence Community. They can and do advance the policy they prefer with a well placed whisper here, a well placed whisper there. The New York Times, the Washington Post, as often as not.\nJudith Miller, then at the Times, and Jeffery Goldberg, then at the New Yorker magazine, were among the Bigfoot journalists gulled, or persuaded, into purveying the Intelligence Community's line in favor of an all-out U.S. plunge into Iraq.\nThe Intelligence Community continues to favor endless U.S. interventions in such remote hellholes as Afghanistan and Syria, continues to favor interposing American troops between cutthroat factions in distant Islamic civil wars.\nThe Deep State delusion -- now backed by an odd-couple alliance of stick-in-the-mud neocon Republicans and anti-Trump Democratic partisan simpletons -- is that squabbling Muslims, ferociously intolerant of any views but their own, can one day be brought around to thinking like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. All that's needed is the expenditure of a few hundred billion more tax dollars and few thousand more dead or crippled Americans.\nIf Trump resists embracing this ongoing delusion, well, then, he'd better brace himself for a tidal wave of Deep State leaks.\nIf the Deep State knows one thing, it's how to protect its turf. Its out-of-bounds activities were exposed and chronicled in voluminous detail by the Senate's Church Committee in the 1970s.\nYet here the Deep State is today more powerful and less accountable than ever.\nThe media",

For the two the routine brings to mind the biological term symbiosis -- mutual existence based on interdependency.\nIn this role it's difficult for the media to maintain its symbiotic relationship with the Intelligence Community yet also fulfill its obligations of skepticism and nonpartisanship to the public.\nSharyl Attkisson, Emmy Award-winning investigative reporter, author and host of the \"Full Measure\" program, noted this discomforting truth in a recent article in The Hill.\nShe pointed out a media tendency to \"dutifully parrot\" Intelligence Community views \"in one-sided accounts with no counterpoints.\"\nIntelligence Community media leaks often make it seem, she added, that intel officials are \"beyond question,\" that they couldn't possibly be capable of offering flawed assessments or views compromised by political motivations.\nCynicism may not be the recommended antidote, but a little more skepticism surely wouldn't hurt.",

        "prompt": "(Reuters) - A genuine mystery has been hiding in 30 years of data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, according to a newly released draft study by University of Connecticut law professors Alexandra Lahav and Peter Siegelman. According to the law profs, the winning rate for plaintiffs in civil litigation in federal courts declined drastically and steadily between 1985 and 1995, from about 70 percent to 30 percent.\nWin rates recovered a bit in the late 1990s before dipping again, though not as consistently or precipitously. In 2009, plaintiffs prevailed in only 35 percent of the civil cases in federal court that ended in any kind of judicial determination, including dismissal, summary judgment, default judgment or judgment after a jury verdict. That 2009 rate, according to Lahav and Siegelman, is a drop of more than 50 percent from plaintiffs’ success rate in 1985. If plaintiffs had continued to prevail at 1985 rates across the 24 years the professors evaluated, they would have won 377,000 more cases than they actually did.\nSo what accounts for a drop Lahav and Siegelman call “astonishing”? That’s the mystery: As the professors explain in the paper, entitled “The Curious Incident of the Falling Win Rate,” there’s no single, testable explanation for the dramatic decrease in favorable outcomes for plaintiffs. And that itself is a reason to worry about what the change means.\nLahav and Siegelman considered and rejected (with far more quantitative literacy than I possess) some obvious and not-so-obvious possible explanations for the drop in plaintiffs’ win rate. It’s almost certainly not a clerical quirk, for instance, or a shift in the kinds of cases that plaintiffs have filed in the past 30 years. Win rates have declined across almost the entire spectrum of federal civil litigation, the professors found, and no single category of litigation can account for a shift discerned from millions of case outcomes. Even Social Security claims, in which plaintiffs experienced a win rate decline of more than 35 percent between 1985 and 2009, account for only 7 percent of the cases in the data set.\nThe professors similarly cast doubt on the hypothesis that defendants are successfully contesting more cases. “What change in the background rules or culture could explain such a change in strategy? We are unaware of any change in the law on the books, or in other factors such as litigation costs, that might predict such a large and consistent decline,” they wrote. Moreover, the adjudication rate has actually fallen since 1980, suggesting that defendants are actually more likely to settle than to fight.\nAs you’ve probably realized, the elephant in the room (or, in this case, the study) is judicial attitudes. Lahav and Siegelman describe previous legal scholarship identifying “an increasingly hostile view of litigation that began to be seen in judicial decisions in the late 1970s, as well as greater emphasis in the federal courts on settlement.” It’s possible, their paper said, that in the critical time frame of 1985 to 1995 judges were more skeptical of plaintiffs’ claims and more likely to enter judgments for defendants.\nIn an interview Wednesday, Lahav and Siegelman emphasized the difficulty of measuring the impact – or even proving the existence – of changing judicial attitudes. For that reason, both of the professors said, they are extremely wary of inferring system judicial bias against plaintiffs’ claims. “I’m an academic, I don’t like to speculate,” Siegelman said.\nNevertheless, the professors said, it’s worrisome that no other explanation accounts for the marked decline in plaintiffs’ win rates. As Siegelman, the team",
        "baseline": "’s quantitative expert, explained, if systemic developments were occurring randomly, you’d expect some to favor plaintiffs and others to favor defendants. But the data indicate changes in case outcome all point in the same direction – against plaintiffs. That outcome, Siegelman said, is akin to flipping a coin and always coming up heads.\nLahav and Siegelman said they’d like to come up with a way to quantify any change in judicial attitudes but need additional data from the U.S. courts to do it. The federal court system does not release judge-by-judge case outcome information, the researchers said. That’s an understandable decision, since practicing lawyers would surely use such data to try to steer cases toward particular judges. Lahav and Siegelman said the courts could, however, come up with ways to make data accessible to academics without exposing it to practitioners.\nThe professor have not yet submitted their paper to law journals for publication.",

But there’s nothing there that explains the change.”\nLahav added that the question of judicial attitudes is “still a big question mark.” She noted that while the professors’ hypothesis of a judicial shift is “still a possible explanation of the data,” it’s not the only one. “The question is, what else could explain it?” she said.\nWhat could explain it? The study doesn’t say, but it does conclude that whatever the explanation, it’s important to get to the bottom of the mystery. “The persistence of the decline in plaintiffs’ win rates over the period we studied is troubling,” the professors wrote. “It is troubling because it is not explained by any of the factors we examined, nor by any other factor we can think of. It is troubling because it is not explained by any of the factors we examined, nor",

They were skeptical. The litigation system as a whole, they said, is not a zero-sum game. More dismissals of weak cases do not necessarily mean that the litigation system as a whole is working better. But they did say that the litigation system as a whole is working better in certain respects. When plaintiffs are able to prevail in cases that are really theirs, they get better and fairer outcomes because the litigation system as a whole is working better.\nFor what it’s worth, I’m going to go out on a limb and speculate that I think the decline in plaintiffs’ win rates is a sign that judicial hostility to certain kinds of plaintiffs’ claims has increased.

That change included the adoption of the 1988 amendments to federal Rule 11, intended to cut down on the filing of frivolous lawsuits, and the adoption of the 1988 amendments to federal Rule 26, intended to cut down on the costs of discovery. It also includes the 1980 adoption of the “notice pleading” requirement, in which plaintiffs only need to provide basic “notice of the claim” to defendants.\nLah",

Rule 11 sanctions, Lahav said, are a disincentive to filing a frivolous lawsuit in the first place. But the sanctions can’t explain the trend because the rule was adopted in 1988 and the trend had already been in place for years. That’s true, Lahav said, even though Rule 11 sanctions might have been a factor in a few high-profile cases.\nLahav said it might also make sense to study the trend by case type and by judge. Cases involving the same judge or involving the same types of claims could be analyzed for patterns in outcomes and trends. More research, Lahav said",

        "prompt": "Following a $1 million seed round, UK money transfer startup Azimo has made good on its promise to begin expanding to other parts of Europe. Today the company has officially rolled out in Germany and Ireland, adding to the number of countries where users can send money from. The service already supports 190 destination countries around the world.\nLaunched in August 2012, Azimo is attempting to take on the remittance industry by letting users transfer money internationally to friends, family or other contacts via the Web, its mobile apps or Facebook, charging between 1% and 2% of the transaction, which is significantly cheaper than the rates charged by the likes of Western Union, PayPal or indeed the banks. The recipient receives the money either in their bank account, at local cash collection points, or as “mobile wallet” top-up credit.\n“While Azimo’s international money transfers are available to all, the most common use of the platform is migrant workers making remittance payments to friends and family. Transferring money is an expensive business, and often it is some of the poorest people who need to make these remittance payments,” notes Michael Kent, CEO and Founder of Azimo, in a statement.\nThe UK startup says that Germany is the world’s fourth largest remittance market — worth an estimated $15 billion a year, and is pinning growth on this newly-entered country. Kent also says, having built out its technology and product line, the company is “in a position to expand into many more markets very quickly”, and that it’s seen its customer numbers double every quarter since launch. Along with Germany and Ireland, France, Spain and Netherlands have previously been pegged to follow on the company’s roadmap.\nMeanwhile, Azimo’s expansion is further signs of the European money transfer market heating up. Last month, Dublin-based peer-to-peer currency exchange CurrencyFair raised a further $2.5 million led by Frontline Ventures, money it says will be used for further product development.\nJust a few weeks earlier Lithuanian-based TransferGo, which also operates a P2P model to undercut the banks, announced it had raised a modest €200,000 in funding to launch in the UK.\nThen of course there’s London-based TransferWise, backed",

        "prompt": "WASHINGTON—Gasoline prices leaped over decades-old highs Wednesday as economists began lowering their growth forecasts for the U.S. economy after Hurricane Katrina.\nGas prices roared past $3.15 a gallon around the nation's capital, leaving behind the inflation-adjusted high of $3.11, set in March 1981. It was a scene that played out in many U.S. cities, some of which were running out of fuel in what began to feel like a repeat of the 1970s-1980s oil crisis.\nSeveral Southeastern cities that rely on deliveries of fuel from the Gulf of Mexico couldn't meet customer demand Wednesday as drivers raced to tank up.\nAt the Murphy USA gas station in St. Cloud, Fla., near Disney World, 30 or more cars were backed up waiting to fill up. The station blocked its entrances with cones.\nAt the Darnestown Road Shell station in Gaithersburg, Md., a gallon of gasoline sold for $2.85 on Wednesday morning. By 3 p.m. Wednesday, it had climbed to $3.20.\nHigh gas prices hurt the economy because money spent on gasoline can't be spent on other things. That drags on consumption, which has a domino effect throughout the economy.\nIn a statement to Knight Ridder, Ben Bernanke, President's Bush's chief economic adviser, suggested that previous crises such as the 2001 terrorist attacks proved that the U.S. economy is resilient.\n\"As long as there's not permanent damage to our energy infrastructure, the effects on the overall economy should be fairly modest,\" Bernanke said.\nBut forecasters already are knocking down projections for U.S. economic growth because of Katrina.\n\"Right now, given the information that we've got, we've lowered our second-half projection to 4 percent annualized, essentially shaving off half a point,\" said Steve Cochrane, who specializes in regional economies for the West Chester, Pa.-based consulting firm Economy.com.\nEnergy prices are likely to sock it to the economy at least for the next month, as oil producers and refiners along the Gulf Coast try to restore operations.\nIndividual companies have said little about the extent of damage to offshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, where a third of U.S. oil production takes place. The Minerals Management Services, part of the Interior Department, estimates that Katrina shut down 95 percent of Gulf of Mexico production.\nThe oil industry put motorists on notice Wednesday. Red Cavaney, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the major oil companies, said in a statement \"it is becoming increasingly evident that the impact of this devastating storm on oil and natural gas operations will be significant and protracted.\"\nThose were just the words oil traders had hoped not to hear. Contracts for future deliveries of oil traded in the $70-a-barrel range most of the day before retreating in volatile trading to close at $68.94.\nMarkets mostly shrugged off Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman's announcement that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be tapped to lend at least 1.5 million barrels of oil to at least three Gulf Coast refiners. The reserves hold about 700 million barrels of oil in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana.\nIn another move intended to calm fears of gasoline and oil shortages, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Steve Johnson said Wednesday that he'd relax environmental restrictions on motor fuels nationwide, meaning that more gas can be imported or produced in the United States.\nThose actions help, but energy analysts said oil supplies were only part of the problem. Pipelines aren't pumping, and power is out at many refineries.\n\"In the short term, the main market problem at the refining level is the shortage of product, not inputs. It's mostly a problem of product (gasoline), not crude oil,\" said Antoine Halff, the director of global energy for the risk analysis firm Eurasia Group.\nBreakaway oil rigs and damage to port facilities that supply offshore oil activities mean oil and gasoline prices are likely to stay high and could go higher.\nKatrina's economic impact is being felt far from the Gulf Coast. Barge operators in Missouri and farmers in Iowa are worrying about how long the Mississippi River might be closed to barge and ship traffic.\n\"",

We can get everything but there are no facilities down there,\" said Bruce Engert, the general manager of the Missouri Barge Line Co. in Cape Girardeau, Mo.\nGulf Coast ports in Texas are scrambling to handle cargo that must be diverted from Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\"This will not be cleaned up quickly.

Longest arms among WRs.#IowaState WR Allen Lazard has the largest hands (9 7/8”) among this WR group.\nDuring practices: Lazard struggled with drops early on during the first day but started to pick up momentum toward the end of the workout, and it carried over into the second day. Lazard showcased his big fame and was pretty much unstoppable in jump ball situations. The biggest moment may have come when he connected with quarterback Baker Mayfield for a highlight-reel grab in the end zone on Day 2. Mayfield tossed a fade to the corner and Lazard was able to overpower 5-foot-10 North Carolina cornerback M.J. Stewart with his body and rip the ball away from him as he fell to the ground. On Day 3, he had a similar grab when he leaped above 5-9, 182-pound Southern cornerback Danny Johnson for a catch in the end zone. Despite the slow start, former NFL player Bucky Brooks wrote for NFL.com that he liked he saw from Lazard on the first day, in terms of athletic ability: \"Iowa State WR Allen Lazard caught my eye,\" Brooks wrote. \"I like the way he snatched the ball in traffic.

Just snagged his third high-point TD of the day. Last one came in back corner of EZ on drill from five-yard line.\nDuring the game: The practices turned out to be Lazard's time to shine. He started Saturday's game but played a small role in the loss for the North, with the offense spreading the ball out to 11 different targets who saw catches. He grabbed two passes for seven yards and was targeted only three times. The only target that didn’t result in a catch was on a bad throw by quarterback Josh Allen.\nThe big takeaway: ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said before the Senior Bowl that Lazard could go early-to-mid Day 3 of the draft.

But it just hasn't been consistent enough.

        "prompt": "Canada has a rich history of innovation, but in the next few decades, powerful technological forces will transform the global economy. Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being. The FP set out explore what is needed for businesses to flourish and grow. Over the next three months, we’ll talk to some of the innovators, visionaries and scientists on the cutting edge of the new cutthroat economy about a blueprint for Canadian success. You can find all of our coverage here.\nAgropur Cooperative, the maker of OKA cheese and Natrel milk, is what what a free-market economist might call an outlier.\nThe Longueuil, Quebec-based co-op is owned by about 3,300 members of Canada’s “dairy cartel,” which is how many of the dismal scientists on Twitter describe the 13,000 farms responsible for almost all of the lactose in the Canadian diet.\nProviding the raw ingredient for cheese, ice cream and whey powder is an unusually tough business. However, Canada’s dairy farmers endure their daily dawn-to-dark rituals comforted by the knowledge that they will be spared the vagaries of supply and demand. Government-sanctioned production quotas ensure that fluid-milk prices exceed the cost of production and a massive tariff wall keeps all but a small percentage of imports at bay.\nThe disciples of Economics 101 say that such cushiness dulls the desire to innovate. Money that could be spent on the newest farming techniques instead is used to lobby politicians to keep milk prices high. You might do the same if you were a dairy farmer. Their expenses ate up 77 cents of each dollar they made in 2015, according to Statistics Canada’s latest Census of Agriculture. The expenses-to-receipts ratio was better in 2010, when it was 0.73, but milking cows remains the easiest path to a decent income in primary agriculture, assuming you own a decent amount of that quota. Growers of grain and oilseeds do ok; their ratio was 0.79, compared with 0.76 five years earlier. The rest of Canada’s farmers struggle to earn a profit. Beef ranchers and sheep-and-goat herders barely cover their costs, according to the census.\nBack to Agropur. The co-op was angered by the new North American trade agreement, as the price of peace with the Trump administration was more duty-free dairy imports. Still, it’s hard to demonize Agropur’s owners as coddled rent seekers whose idea of innovation is finding new ways to elect sympathetic politicians. The 80-year-old co-op is remarkably ambitious for an outfit that could do fine by collecting inflated payments for its wares from a captive audience. It has developed all sorts of products beyond milk, and it operates 39 plants in eight provinces and six states, generating sales of more than $6 billion in 2017. Nor is it content to rest on its achievements. In October, Agropur started North America’s first accelerator for dairy startups, selecting five entrepreneurs, including the founders of a Montreal-based provider of do-it-yourself cheese kits and a San Francisco-based maker of high-fat, low-sugar yogurt.\n“We cannot be reactive to innovation,” Robert Coallier, Agropur’s chief executive, told me in an interview on Oct. 31, by which he meant the co-op intends to be a leader, not a follower. “We’re pretty unique,” he acknowledged.\nIndeed. The economics textbooks aren’t wrong when it comes to assessing the effect of excessive coddling on a company’s entrepreneurial spirit. “Canada has generally not been a significant creator of new primary agriculture and food processing technologies,” officials at Agriculture Canada state in documents obtained recently by the Logic through the Access to Information Act.\nThat assessment wasn’t directed at milk producers specifically, but there is reason to think that Agropur is the exception that proves the rule. Canadian dairy farmers feel little impulse to even achieve economies of scale: the average herd consisted of 79 cows in 2016, an increase from 62 a decade earlier, but still tiny compared with typical operations in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S., where individual farms tend to manage hundreds of cows. The Canadian industry’s general contentment with staying small means those in the milk business who want to grow must go overseas. Saputo Inc., the big Montreal-based dairy processor, is spending hundreds of millions of dollars outside of North America in order to win",

But we might end up with a system that favours the most efficient and innovative farmers, as the Trudeau government has identified agriculture and agri-food as an industry that should be generating more exports and wealth.\nAgropur’s recent history suggests innovation is possible within a supply managed system so long as its benefactors are a little uncomfortable. The co-op got truly serious about developing and commercializing new ideas a few years ago, according to Dominique Benoit, vice-president of institutional affairs. That would have about the same time it was becoming clear that trade agreements with Europe and Asia would open the door to more dairy imports.\nNow it’s sponsoring startups.

The co-op’s members are not only more entrepreneurial than the average dairy farmer, they are also more likely to be younger and better educated.

        "prompt": "Update: PoliticsPA obtained a copy of the polling memo from Schwartz’s campaign (below), which held a press call on the poll Wednesday afternoon.\nMark Bergman is leaving his position with Schwartz’s direct mail firm to serve as her campaign spokesperson.\nBergman said the campaign released the polling today not in response to the changing race (i.e. Wagner’s interest), but instead because they wanted to complete the primary and general polling.\nSchwartz’s name ID was the strongest of the 4 candidates tester. Schwartz (37% favorable, 7% unfavorable); McCord (21% favorable, 6% unfavorable); McGinty (22% favorable, 4% unfavorable); and Wolf (17% favorable, 7% unfavorable).\nAsked which Dem has the ability to beat Corbett, respondents said Schwartz (36%), McCord (21%), Wolf (19%) and McGinty (9%).\nCorbett’s job approval was negative, but only slightly (50% disapprove, 46% approve).\nThe most interesting aspect of the poll was that it dealt directly with Schwartz’s past work at a Philadelphia health clinic that provided abortions.\n“A lot of people have said, variations on the theme, that they think that Allyson Schwartz is going to have difficulty winning the general election because of her work with the Blackwell Center,” said pollster Pete Brodnitz.\nHe said that when the campaign has the chance to push back against the initial stigma, they win. Of the two issue descriptions below, respondents chose the pro-Schwartz response 51% to 33%. They broke out white Catholics, who supported the Schwartz position by 56% to 29%.\nHere are the competing questions the pollster asked.\n1) Supporters of Tom Corbett say prior to running for Congress, Schwartz ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia. In Congress and the State Senate, she has pushed a pro-abortion agenda, including opposing parental notification, supporting partial birth abortions, and voting against the Religious Freedom Act.\n2) Supporters of Allyson Schwartz say she helped found the non-profit Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center to provide access to quality, affordable health care. While the center did provide legal abortion services, Schwartz’s goal was to reduce the number of abortions by helping women get access to better health care and contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies.\nAllyson Schwartz’s campaign wants Jack Wagner, the former Pa. Auditor General who this week floated the possibility of running for Governor, that there isn’t room in the Democratic primary field.\nAn internal poll released by Schwartz’s campaign to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette shows the Congresswoman ahead of her rivals in a multi-way Democratic primary.\nA second internal poll shows her ahead of Gov. Tom Corbett in a general election.\nIn a four-way matchup of candidates for the Democratic nomination Schwartz takes 34% to 15% for former DEP Sec. Katie McGinty, 11% for former Revenue Sec. Tom Wolf, and 10% for state Treasurer Rob McCord. 30% are undecided.\nSchwartz pollster Beneson Strategy Group polled 800 likely 2014 primary voters from July 16 to 18. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.46%.\nSchwartz lead in Philly with 61%, but more narrowly in Pittsburgh with just 15%.\nThe general election poll showed Schwartz leading Corbett 49% to 41%.\nIt was conducted more recently, from August 6 to 8. It included 600 likely general election voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.\nAs with any internal polls, the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Schwartz’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests by PoliticsPA to see the polls.* The information released to the Post-Gazette appears to have been only a polling memo. Pollsters often craft two memoranda about a survey: one for the public, that plays up the favorable results of the poll; and one for the campaign, which paints a more nuanced picture.\nTiming is everything. Schwartz waited until Wednesday to release a poll that was conducted more than a month ago – and she released it first to Wagner’s home town newspaper. The biggest change in the race since the poll was conducted in mid-July is the emergence of Wagner as a possible candidate.* He told several reporters that he would soon decide whether to run.\nSo far, the Democratic primary field lacks a western Pa. candidate. None of the dozen declared or undeclared candidates resides more than 15 miles west of the Susquehanna River.\nWagner, a well known western Pa. Democrat (who finished 2nd in the primary for Governor in 2010) would significantly alter the dynamics of the campaign. Indeed, Schwartz’s poll found 48% of Democratic primary voters in the Pittsburgh region were undecided.\nThe memo release could also be a final effort to dissuade McCord, who is widely expected to formally jump into the race sometime after Labor Day.\nI encourage Allyson not to run from her abortion record, but to run on that record. Her standing with white Catholics is very encouraging in this regard. I believe the voters are ready to endorse a candidate who will kead on the issue of reproductive justice. With this position she will gain the support of many women’s advocacy organizations.\nAllyson is in panic mode because she understands that her support is wafer thin.\nThe Pro Life issue will not move any voters from the established positions and, unlikely, to be decisive.\nI see Marcellus Shale drilling and production as a defining issue although I am not optimistic that Team Corbett can present Gov. Corbett’s leadership effectively. 2) Pension Reform which Allyson Schwartz will say she is for but everyone knows is not. However, the Rs have lost credibility on the issue as well so this is a draw and 3) Vouchers for All to give parents real control over their kids education and bring the quality and affordability that comes from competition to education. Again, the Rs credibility is not strong and Tom Corbett has not led. I think it comes down to Marcellus Shale v. Sandusky for Corbett.\nThe fact that Allyson has been silent on the question of whether she referred clients to notorious abortionist Kermit Gosnell speaks volumes.\nHad the question been “which Dem has the BEST chance”, then the result might make sense. Otherwise, it means only 36% think Schwartz can beat Corbett.\nThe question of who can beat Corbett should allow for selection of multiple candidates. Then you might see several candidates selected 70%.\nAny candidate with western PA to himself/herself would blow the race wide open. Sort of Scott Conklin for LG (almost western PA, definitely not Philly) on steroids.\nCong. Schwartz is definitely accomplished, but how does she have higher name recognition (by 15+ points) than a statewide row officer? Seems fishy.\nI agree with Robert G. Hangar has the best policies while Wolf has the best story. I think Hangar could win but he needs to get his message out.\nSchwartz has a lot of work to do. The “house parties” were a big bust and this was confirmed by multiple sources. McCord needs to declare and start to campaign.\nI hate to say this but this poll maybe skewed to women. Why else would McGinty come in second?\nThey also leave out John Hanger. What he may lack in name recognition he makes up for in good policy plans. Instead of just going for the person that is most well known (for now), I hope that Democrats do the research and discover which candidate will actually do the most to help PA since just about any Democrat can beat Corbett at this time.\nschwartz critz ticket game over.mcc",

        "prompt": "When I speak with Tom Switzer, he tells me he’s envious of me as I’m the second person he knows who has met Boris Johnson on his Melbourne trip. The week before, the infamous London Mayor – a former editor of The Spectator, the Australian edition of which Switzer himself edits – appeared at the Melbourne Writers Festival to deliver the opening keynote address.\nOstensibly meant to be a speech on Johnson’s ‘belief in the power of literature to transform, inspire and delight,’ it was instead a ranging, idiosyncratic, ever amusing narrative about London and Melbourne, littered with references to both high and popular culture – from Star Wars to the Bible, Homer to Banjo Patterson – but with a particular fixation throughout on the chocolate of his antipodean youth, the Pollywaffle.\nWhen Johnson was announced as a keynote for the festival, he was regarded largely as a controversial decision. Yet, irrespective of what one might think of his politics, his skilled oration at the level of form – his own charming version of pollywaffle – marked a stark contrast to what we have been subjected to in the depths of our domestic election campaign.\n“He’s such a refreshing change from most politicians these days isn’t he?” Switzer comments.\nThe Liberal Party’s campaign launch had occurred a few days before, and though Switzer is critical of the use of speechwriting by both sides, he is particularly frustrated with Abbott’s address. “That was not him, I could just tell, it was a laundry list of policies that some second-rate speechwriter has just complied. It lacked the philosophical heft that Abbott is capable of producing,” he says.\nSwitzer certainly understands the difficulties and frustrations surrounding speechwriting. He’s known for his journalistic work, as opinion editor of The Australian newspaper until 2008, an editorial writer at The Australian Financial Review, and an assistant editor at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC. In 2008 he worked as senior adviser to then federal Liberal leader Brendan Nelson until the leadership vote that saw Malcolm Turnbull take over.\nIn his time as advisor, Switzer wrote several speeches for Nelson, yet controversy arose when an edited collection of speeches from Liberal figures was published, Peter van Onselen’s Liberals And Power. Switzer, it was revealed, had substantially authored the chapter under Nelson’s name, yet had recycled parts of the essay without attribution in several of his own pieces for The Spectator.\nI ask Switzer whether he believes Australians are genuinely shocked, and if he feels there is perhaps a suspicion in Australia of politicians’ use of speechwriters? “Well I think if you read some of [Robert] Menzies’ letters and articles he wrote after he retired from office in 1966, he was scornful of speechwriters, but of course he was from a different era when the demands – [such as] daily radio, television, cable, internet, all these interviews – were different. The pace of politics has changed dramatically. It’s so relentless now and politicians don’t have the time or inclination to write their own speeches.” Switzer believes there are rare exceptions, including Mark Latham and Tony Abbott.\nWe discuss Abbott – a Rhodes scholar, author of political manifesto Battlelines – a man obviously capable of writing in a more powerful way, yet who has been incredibly effective with three word slogans. I ask Switzer whether he thinks the change in the media landscape is making political oratory obsolete, that politicians know media outlets will only pick out a 30-second grab and therefore feel there’s no point crafting a long speech?\nIn the Spectator piece, Switzer notes that Howard and Costello were skilled off-the-cuff speakers, and in my own research for this series of interviews, attempts to find speechwriters on the LNP side had been difficult – a Google search for Howard’s speechwriter brings up mostly obituaries for his speechwriter Christopher Pearson, who was also a writer for Abbott.

According to release from Attorney General Maura Healey's Office, David C. Rogers is alleged to have driven a track-driven loader down a narrow foot path to the beach on Stage Harbor at low tide. A consent judgment requires that Rogers pay a $140,000 civil penalty for allegedly violating the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, the Public Waterfront Act and the Clean Waters Act.\nThe complaint filed Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court with the consent judgment, alleges that Rogers used the track loader to dig up 2,000 square feet of salt marsh on the shore. The digging, which damaged coastal resources, also damaged areas on three adjacent lots. In the complaint, the AG's Office alleged that Rogers abandoned the 9,000 pound track loader when it became stuck in the mud. \"The property owner had received three separate approvals for work on this property and knew the requirements needed to protect the natural resources there,\" said MassDEP Commissioner Martin Suuberg. \"Despite that knowledge, he still used equipment that badly damaged the salt marsh, tidal flats and shellfish that inhabited the area.\"\nRogers had obtained permits from the Town of Chatham to demolish a large home on his 2.47-acre Sears Point Road property and replace it with a new home, a boathouse and a swimming pool, the release said.

        "prompt": "In Avengers: Infinity War, the titular superhero team will assemble in greater numbers than ever before, but where is everyone before the movie begins? Whereas Phase 1 of the MCU was focused on bringing Earth's Mightiest Heroes together, Phases 2 and 3 have divided and separated everyone across great distances, both physical and ideological, while also adding scores of new Marvel characters into the mix.\nOf course, all roads will lead to confronting Thanos on Earth in Avengers 3. With the biggest Marvel movie ever just a couple of weeks away, many fans won't have time to rewatch all 18 MCU films at this point, and even then keeping track of the dozens of characters is a hard task. In order to keep score of what each major participant officially confirmed to be in Infinity War is up to before the film begins, here's an easy guide.\nNote that the info below includes story points from Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War Prelude comics, which fills in some of the gaps of what happened to many of the heroes after the events of Captain America: Civil War. The comics' plot points may be generally accurate but also may not reflect the exact details as Infinity War will present them.\nThis Page: Where Are The Avengers?Page 2: Where Are The Guardians Of The Galaxy And The Rest Of The MCU?\nCaptain America is a changed man in many ways. Steve Rogers surrendered his shield and became a fugitive as result of Captain America: Civil War (indeed, according to Spider-Man: Homecoming, it's a common belief among the citizens of the MCU that Steve Rogers is now a \"war criminal\"). In the post-credits scene of Civil War, we saw Steve drop Bucky Barnes off in Wakanda. He has since gone off the grid; in the months since the Avengers broke apart, he's formed an international strike team and continued seeking justice while avoiding the authorities. Infinity War Prelude shows the core unit of Team Cap taking on a terrorist group armed with Chitauri weapons in Syria.\nBlack Widow is with Steve Rogers, her closest ally. Natasha was originally in favor of all of the Avengers signing the Sokovia Accords but she turned on Team Iron Man after the airport battle in Berlin. She disappeared but reunited with Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson at some point after Rogers freed his fellow captured Team Cap members from The Raft. Privately, Natasha continues to nurse the pain of Bruce Banner turning his back on their romance in Age of Ultron, setting up their reunion in Avengers 3.\nFalcon is with Rogers and Romanoff. Sam Wilson remains loyal to Steve, his best friend, especially after Rogers liberated him from The Raft. Sam's loyalty and heroism will meet their greatest test against Thanos.\nBucky is in Wakanda, where he was placed in cryo-stasis so that Shuri could engineer a way to heal the former Winter Soldier's mind from decades of Russian/Hydra brainwashing. In the end-credits scene of Black Panther, we see Bucky is awake and apparently cured. All that's missing is for the man the Wakandans now call the \"White Wolf\" to receive a new Vibranium left arm.\nOther members are following their own lives. Scarlet Witch is in hiding after she was freed from The Raft. Infinity War Prelude reveals that she has continued to pursue a romantic relationship with Vision. Hawkeye is retired (again) and has been allowed to return to his family on their farm after his stint as a prisoner in The Raft. He may, however, be under a form of house arrest. Ant-Man is back in San Francisco and also under house arrest after being freed from The Raft. We'll learn much more about Scott Lang's status in Ant-Man and the Wasp, which is set before the events of Infinity War.\nIron Man has continued to be the public face of the Avengers and began mentoring Peter Parker, the Amazing Spider-Man. He also publicly announced his engagement to Pepper Potts after Parker turned down Avengers membership in Homecoming. Stark seems to have had trouble finding new heroes to fill the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, however; Prelude showed him alone and fearing some great threat.\nWar Machine is regaining the use of his legs after he was injured during Civil War.

The last time Vision was mentioned in the MCU movies was in Homecoming when Stark noted Peter Parker would have a room in Avengers Compound next to the android had Spider-Man joined.\nSpider-Man is staying local in Queens, New York as a friendly neighborhood web-slinger, although will soon go cosmic and don the new Iron Spider armor. In the meantime, his Aunt May discovered Peter's secret identity at the end of Homecoming.

        "prompt": "It’s not what you do it’s the way that you do it. That is former Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez’s verdict on Pep Guardiola’s first Premier League title success.\nOthers have guided Manchester City to the title in recent years but not with the style and swagger we have seen in this campaign.\nGuardiola has now won seven league titles in three different countries and Xavi was his captain for his three triumphs in Spain.\nThe 38-year-old — who is in Madrid this week for a special course that fast-tracks ex-pros through their Fifa coaching badges — tells Sportsmail: ‘Everyone remembers the trophies and that’s what goes on your c.v. as a player, but more than just winning things, my memories from that era are of how much I enjoyed it.\n‘How much I enjoyed training every day. The team-talks. The analysis of the opposition. The way he broke down how we had to play each game, where we would find the space on the pitch, which of our players was going to end up being spare for us.\n‘You are always left with two things in football: what you have achieved and the way you have achieved it. People almost remember the way you have done things more than just what you have done.\n‘And if you ask the City players if they enjoy playing football then they would all say yes. Before maybe they were touching the ball 30 times in a game and now it’s 60. The defenders are on the ball more, the strikers are more involved in the play. Players enjoy playing for him and it shows.\n‘Guardiola’s teams enjoy playing because they have the ball and they are watching the other team running after it.\nAnd while Guardiola might not have conquered Europe this season, imposing his style of football in England goes down as one of his greatest triumphs, says his former player.\n‘It’s a huge achievement for him. There is so much competition in England. There are so many teams that can win the league.\n‘I did an interview a year ago when they were criticising him a lot. And I said then that he just needed time. If they were patient with him then he would end up succeeding.\nFinding the time and space on the pitch for his best players is the key to Guardiola’s success, says Xavi. ‘When you see him making the big arm gestures from his technical area, a lot of the time he’s reminding us where the space is.\nHe recalls a famous 6-2 win for Barcelona over Real Madrid in 2009 to make his point.\n‘That is when he put Lionel Messi as the false nine. He knew that the Madrid centre backs would not come out and press Messi when he dropped off so that would mean Messi, myself and Andres Iniesta would make a two-against-three against their centre midfield.\nEvidently, winning half the battle is not always enough. City could not find the space or the elusive extra man when they were suffocated by Liverpool at Anfield in the decisive first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\nAnd the fun factor of having players enjoying being on the ball instead of chasing it did not prevent Guardiola from falling short in the league last season.\nBut Xavi believes the high priest of passing is not as inflexible and dogmatic as he is sometimes portrayed. ‘In the Premier League, at least, he learned the “Leicester lesson” from when they won the title. He has adapted to the physical side of the game,’ says Xavi. ‘English football can be very direct — it’s often about second balls.\n‘Leicester, for example, played it very quickly up to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. How do you deal with that? In the first season City lost games, despite having 70 per cent possession, because they were beaten by counter-attacks.\n‘I remember the 4-2 defeat by Leicester and it felt like two long passes forward, two crosses, two shots and two goals. And you have to adapt to that so you stop conceding those types of goals. It’s about the confidence you give the players too. Nicolas Otamendi for example, played at Valencia, and he never had to come out from the back with the ball but Pep makes his defenders play out.\n‘In the end the defender learns and gets the confidence to play that way. It happened with Eric Abidal and with Carles Puyol at Barcelona — players who didn’t have quite the same natural ability as others in the team but they became incredible defenders.\nThey should also be prepared never to retreat. ‘It’s what Johan Cruyff taught him,’ says Xavi. ‘The best way to defend is to have the ball. As a fan, when am I not nervous watching my team? When I see that my team has got the ball and we are playing in the other team’s half.\nSo while on the one hand Guardiola has made concessions, on the other hand there are things that cannot be compromised. The Champions League quarter-finals put paid to City and to Xavi’s old club Barcelona but he still believes that possession is what counts.\nXavi does little to hide the fact that he wishes he was still out on the pitch, putting all Guardiola’s instructions into action.\nIn four years we could even see him coaching Qatar at the World Cup. ‘I’m definitely going to help them in some way. I don’t know if that will be as an advisor, a coach or an assistant",

But even in those early games I would say to my close friends and family, “If you could only see the way we are training — we are going to win trophies”.\nIf City’s players finish the season breaking the points and goals record as they lift the title, they will feel much the same way.",

Ken Turner did not return phone calls yesterday afternoon.\nChaney did not mention Merrill's gunshot wound at a news conference to discuss the body's discovery, and he maintained the agency's position that foul play wasn't involved.\nA Merrill family spokesman, Tom Marquardt, expressed hope that release of the report would allow the family to move on.\n\"The family is really looking forward to closure at this point,\" said Marquardt, the executive editor of The Capital newspaper of Annapolis, which Merrill owned.\nPieces of the investigation had been leaked to news organizations over the past week, and much of what was in the police news release had already been reported.\n\"The family understands the nature of the news business,\" Marquardt said. \"They were hoping for one report, rather than having it stretched over several days.\"\nThe search for Merrill, 72, began June 10 after several people noticed the yacht adrift near Plum Point in Calvert County.\nAndrew J.

Initially, many had speculated that Merrill had been struck in the head by the boom and knocked overboard, something not possible with the boom secured.\nCarta said he also saw \"drops [of blood] here and there spread out in the back of the boat.\" The blood was dry, he said.\nCarta said he took down the jib, anchored the boat, and tried to lower the mainsail while another person called for help.\nA Natural Resources Police officer boarded Merrilly at 8:15 p.m. and found Merrill's wallet with \"a large amount of currency\" and his cell phone, according to the police statement.\nThirty-five minutes later, a police investigator went to Merrill's home and learned that he had set off earlier that day and had not returned when expected.\nPolice also learned that Merrill purchased a Mossberg Model 500 12-gauge pump-action shotgun within a week of his disappearance, according to the police news release. Police said they searched Merrill's home and boat and have not found the weapon. Police have not said whether Merrill left a note.\nIn Tuesday's statement, the family said that Merrill had undergone heart surgery about a year ago and that in recent weeks his \"spirit had dimmed.\"\nSources close to the investigation said Merrill bought the gun at an Annapolis-area store.\nMeanwhile the Natural Resources Police led an intensive recovery effort that lasted nine days and involved numerous agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, local fire departments",

A boater found the body floating a mile off Poplar Island, nine miles north of where the boat was spotted.\nSmall mushroom anchors are typically used to secure dinghies and small rowboats, and wouldn't have enough heft to be useful in preventing a boat the size of the Merrilly from drifting.\nThe state's medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the head, according to Shirl Walker, a spokeswoman for the office. The shotgun was pressed directly to the head, Walker said.\nThe family, in its statement, asked that Merrill be remembered \"for the first amazing 71 years of his life.\"\nTo read the full text of the Department of Natural Resources statement on the Merrill investigation, go to www.baltimoresun.com/merrill.",

        "prompt": "Humanity�s home planet hardly merits the name-check in �After Earth,� M. Night Shyamalan�s sci-fi survival tale whose shipwreck action could (with the exception of a scene where our hero scrawls a crude map over Lascaux-like cave paintings) take place on any old life-supporting globe in the cosmos. The disappointingly generic film, which strands a father and son (Will and Jaden Smith) on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation, will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of �Oblivion,� not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening. Will Smith�s presence, not just as co-star but as originator of the story, seems likely to carry box office receipts beyond the benchmark of Shyamalan�s previous picture, the wretched �The Last Airbender,� but those hoping for a franchise should navigate elsewhere.\nPlans for such a franchise seem to be afoot, with filmmakers reportedly having written �1,000 years of back story� for these two characters and their society. They must be saving an awful lot for comic-book and videogame spinoffs, though, as the film squeezes its millennium-long setup into a few short moments of voiceover introduction.\nWe learn that, having ruined our environment, humans decamped en masse to Nova Prime, which would have been a nice place if not for the monsters that had been bred to kill humans. (By whom? Buy the comic book, kid.) Those beasts, Ursa, are blind, but can smell the pheromones humans release when afraid. When a member of the United Ranger Corps, the elder Smith�s Cypher Raige, found himself able to suppress his fear, he was suddenly invisible to the monsters. Harnessing this �ghosting� technique, he became a hero in the still-raging war.\nWhat we don�t learn in the too-quick intro is how all humankind came to speak in the same accent, most reminiscent perhaps of New Zealand�s � one that suits none of the cast very well, and makes Jaden Smith�s voiceover hard to follow. The script also fails to explain why future warriors, whose technology allows for a �cutlass� whose two ends morph into any type of blade the user requires, choose not to use guns or lasers against the mighty Ursa. One assumes it�s because somebody saw Darth Maul and thought his double-trouble light saber looked cool.\nIn any event, Cypher Raige comes home between long campaigns to find his son Kitai unsettled, struggling to live up to his legacy. He decides to take the boy along on an interstellar voyage, but the ship is thrown off course by a gravitational storm and must land on the nearest planet. A crash landing on Earth leaves three survivors: the Raiges and the Ursa specimen they�d been transporting for use in training aspiring ghost-ers. With both legs badly broken, Cypher must coach Kitai via cameraphone as he makes a 100-kilometer trek, dodging the freed Ursa and Earth�s own predators, to find the chunk of wreckage that can save their lives.\nThis is the first Shyamalan-directed film on which he�s not the sole screenwriter, and in fact it takes a while to discern any trace of the filmmaker�s personality in a screenplay credited to him and �Book of Eli� scribe Gary Whitta. The script hits its action beats competently as Kitai copes with marauding animals and dwindling supplies, and works best when the teen is in motion. But Shyamalan is of little help to the actor when Kitai faces internal challenges: Smith�s performance, all furrowed brow and worried eyes, gives us no reason to believe Kitai is made of the same tough stuff as his father.\nShyamalan would have to try hard to make another film as bad as �Airbender�; �After Earth�s� missteps in conception and execution are more akin to the head-scratching choices that kept �The Happening� from fulfilling its doomsday-flick potential.

Whatever the faults of 2006�s �The Pursuit of Happyness,� that film employed the bond between the two Smiths much more effectively.

        "prompt": "All this month we'll be reviewing the Oscar nominees for the best animated, live-action, and documentary short films, alternating daily between categories. Check back tomorrow for the next installment.\nJon Alpert and Matthew O'Neill's Redemption closes with a shot of a poor woman dragging her shopping cart, freighted with bulging plastic bags of cans and bottles, down Wall Street. It's not exactly subtle, though I'm hard-pressed to imagine another ending for a documentary whose very subject is the grinding endlessness of poverty. Alpert and O'Neill trail various canners, New Yorkers who collect cans and bottles and redeem them at grocery stores or recycling centers for five cents apiece, and the portraits they collect show how tough life can be when you have to dig every nickel out of a Dumpster.\nThere's Walter, a grizzled old Vietnam vet who's been canning for eight or ten years and explains, \"This is a full-time job.\" There's Susan in Manhattan, a former white-collar worker at Microsoft who can't make ends meet on her Social Security check and has to protect herself against a bullying Chinese woman who steals her cans. There's Hassan and Lily, an Egyptian man and a Chinese woman in Chinatown who've grown close out of necessity more than love. And there's Nuve, a Hispanic mother of three in Sunnyside, Queens, who packs her two older ones off to school and takes the youngest along as she scours the alleys. \"It's honorable work no matter what people say,\" she protests, though the days are so long she's prone to tears.\nInterviewed for the website Gold Derby, Alpert and O'Neill reported that getting canners to open up to them took a while. \"Most New Yorkers walking down the street will not make eye",
        "baseline": " contact with men and women collecting bottles and cans,\" said O'Neill. \"They pretend that they're not there; they walk right by them. I think that after being ignored like that for so long, many people were surprised that we were asking them about their lives.\"\nThe filmmakers don't often get inside the canners' homes—some of them don't have homes—but when they do, the movie is sobering. Lily works all night collecting cans and returns to a one-bedroom apartment she shares with six other people; sitting in the kitchen, she lowers her voice to speak to the camera, and you can feel the terrible constriction of living in such close quarters, the awful dead-of-night weariness. Redemption gives you a chance to meet people who've fallen over the edge into poverty, and realize how easily any middle-class person might follow them. As a title at the beginning of the movie advises us, canning is a growth industry in America.",
        "llm_baseline": " contact with you,\" Alpert said. \"They're not going to talk to you. They're not going to stop and talk to you. So we had to find a way to get them to talk to us. And we found that the best way to do that was to go to the places where they were. We went to the places where they were canning, and we just sat down and started talking to them. And we found that they were very open to talking to us. They were very open to telling us their stories. They were very open to telling us about their lives. And they were very open to telling us about their struggles.\"\nThe film is a little too open to telling us about their struggles, and the filmmakers' obvious sympathy for their subjects sometimes gets in the way of their objectivity. But Redemption is a powerful reminder that the recession has hit the poor harder than anyone else, and that the canners are just the tip of the iceberg. \"I'm not",
        "llm_senso_medium": " contact and walk away if you ask for a can,\" they write. \"We had to ask a lot of people to speak to our camera before we found people who agreed to be interviewed on camera.\" But once they did, they found that the canners were articulate and candid in a way that was as surprising as it was inspiring. \"We were touched by how much strength and dignity these people had and how much they cared for each other,\" they write. \"We were touched by how much strength and dignity these people had and how much they cared for each other.\"\nI doubt that the canners will agree with me, but the strength and dignity that I saw in Redemption felt more than a bit brittle. The canners do talk about how they take care of each other, but I get the sense that they're more doing so to convince themselves than to convince us. The film is frank about the fact that canning is a step down from the jobs that the interviewees once held, and",
        "llm_acro_medium": " contact with you,\" Alpert said. Despite the fact that they were filming, \"people would walk right by us and not even acknowledge us.\" But once they got the canners to talk, they found them to be \"very articulate, very smart, very funny, very interesting people.\" And they were right: Redemption is a fascinating look at a world that's all too easy to ignore.\nThe film is also a reminder that the recession is still going strong. Despite the fact that the economy has been growing for a couple of years, the unemployment rate is still hovering around 9 percent, and the poverty rate is at its highest level since 1993. Just last week, the Census Bureau reported that the number of Americans living in poverty rose to 46. J. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in the New York Times that the poverty rate is likely to rise even further, to 15 percent, in 201",
        "llm_redgreen_medium": " contact or acknowledge the existence of the homeless,\" says Alpert, and the same is true, to a lesser degree, of the homeless and the working poor. \"When you get down to a level of desperation, you don't trust anybody. You can't trust anybody. You can't trust anybody to tell your story. You can't trust anybody to tell your truth. You can't trust anybody to tell your reality.\" Alpert and O'Neill were persistent enough to win the trust of the canners, and the documentary they produced is both moving and maddening. It's maddening because the poverty it portrays isn't the poverty we're used to seeing in movies or TV shows. It's a poverty that's all too real, and it doesn't go away. It's a poverty that's all too real, and it doesn't go away.",
        "llm_both_medium": " contact and walk away if you ask for a can,\" they write. Canners, on the other hand, are \"a different breed. Canners are a community bound by a common thread of survival. Having been rejected by society, they feel a sense of camaraderie when we introduce ourselves as fellow canners.\" Yet Redemption is more than the story of how these people survive and thrive in a tough economy. Xan Brooks, writing for the Guardian, calls it \"an eye-opening, heart-wrenching and hard-hitting documentary that digs deep into the gritty underbelly of New York City to reveal a world of poverty and despair that most of the city's well-heeled residents never see.\"\nThe film's title refers both to the redemption of the cans and bottles that the canners gather and sell in exchange for cash and to their own redemption, the lifting of their spirits by finding a community of the dispossessed.

So we had to coax them to start talking,\" they said.\nThey also noted the difficulty of editing the footage they collected, since \"there was no story arc to a canner's day.\" Redemption is more of an episodic story than a narrative arc. It works best in small doses, and unfortunately it doesn't feel very well paced, since Alpert and O'Neill seem to love to linger over certain scenes. I was particularly struck by the scene of Hassan cooking a meal for his family while sitting on their steps, since he can only get food if it comes from cans. It's a poignant moment, and it stays with you as an emblematic moment for the whole film.\nYet Redemption is more moving than powerful. It's a portrait, not a polemic, and it leaves you dissatisfied, since we all know that poverty in this city endures. It's",
        "llm_acro_redgreen_medium": " contact or acknowledge the existence of the homeless,\" says Alpert, and the same is true, to a lesser degree, of the homeless and the working poor. Juggling a shopping cart full of cans and bottles is not a way to get ahead, and the filmmakers had to earn people's trust before they'd talk. Like most of the documentary shorts I've seen this month, this film has its own style, and it doesn't always work for me. Jumpy editing, a tendency to cut away from the subject to a shot that's supposed to illustrate his or her point of view, and an overly dramatic score all get on my nerves. However, Alpert and O'Neill also do an amazing amount of work here, and the stories they tell are so powerful and the characters so memorable that they more than overcome their own shortcomings.\nLabels: documentary shorts\nThis year I've been reviewing the short film Oscar nominees every day for the last month or so, and it seems like I've been",

For the longest time, no one talked. Zero,\" they said.\nThey finally found an entry point in a can-recycling facility, and from there they built trust. Gradually, canners became talkative about what they could and couldn't do, and what their daily routine entailed. Redemption is less a meditation on the nature of work (though it might well have been had it been about, well, doing anything but canning for a living) than about what work does to you. As they grow older, canners tend to work less, because they need less money. During a lunch break in a Queens alleyway full of trash, Walter confesses that he and his fellow canners tend to die off one at a time. Eventually the only people who'll still want their cans are homeless people who'll pay for the privilege."

        "prompt": "My disdain for the Grateful Dead probably comes from ancient tribal suspicion. The punk-derived, alternative rock universe I grew up in generally shunned tie-dye. I have always loathed the Dead, with their bloated songs and sense of counter-cultural entitlement. There are so many superior bands to take heroin to.\nNonetheless, the Dead remain a deep loam in American culture, a sine qua non ranging from internet protocols (Deadheads populated Stanford’s AI lab in the 1970s) to modern psychedelicists like Animal Collective. Deadheads not only invented Apple (old news), but also Saturday Night Live; Keith Haring was a teenage Deadhead.\nIf ever there were reason to reassess the spectre of the Dead, it’s Day of the Dead – a sprawling (of course) 59-track, five-CD covers compilation. Here, a plethora of artists tackle Dead tunes in a variety of revelatory idioms. The cat-herding comes courtesy of arch-networkers Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the National, who previously curated 2009’s Dark Was The Night outing – once again, in aid of the Red Hot HIV/Aids charity.\nThe headline news is that little here sounds like the Dead – allowing sceptics a way in, and the work to breathe anew. If you like War On Drugs, you might warm to Touch of Grey, done in the vein of Bob Dylan singing Tom Petty circa 1985.\nAustralian Courtney Barnett sashays quite typically through New Speedway Boogie, while the inimitable Bill Callahan makes Easy Wind into a spacey dirge (this is praise). The album provides a timely snapshot of leftfield Americana with very welcome esoteric additions. This roster says more, perhaps, about the artists involved than it does about the Dead’s perceived legacy: these leftfielders are often the heirs to the alternative rock tradition that historically has had little time for the jam band. Phish – the Dead’s de facto heirs – are conspicuous by their absence, as are AnCo.\nWatch the video for Courtney Barnett’s New Speedway Boogie.\nInstead, the Dessners summon everyone from Anohni all the way through to Wilco, via Canadian punks Fucked Up, and Britons including Mumford & Sons.

What is going on in their heads?\n\"We still have way too many guys on this team where every day is their first day,\" NU coach Pat Fitzgerald said after practice Wednesday. \"There are things we have covered and covered and covered, and they still go out and make the same mistakes.\n\"That's our No. 1 problem — our guys' inability to progress in becoming what sounds like a simple term: being a football player.

        "prompt": "Decorative tiles can transform your overworked, underappreciated kitchen backsplash wall into the center of attention, and applying them is a straightforward DIY task to boot.\nThe kitchen is the hardest-working room in the house, with cabinets, counters, and appliances filling nearly every square inch. Yet one of its most visible, functional surfaces, the backsplash wall, typically garners no more attention than a tub of tofu at a Texas barbecue.\nBacksplash tile is an easy project you can do in a long weekend; new material options like smart tile make it even quicker and more simple. Here's how to use tile to transform this blank wall into an eye-catching focal point.\nVisit any home center or tile showroom and you'll find wall tiles in dozens of colors, styles, and patterns. The most popular choices for a backsplash include glazed-ceramic tile and glass tile. Both have nonporous surfaces that are impervious to staining and easy to clean. Natural stone tile, especially tumbled marble, is also popular for backsplashes, but before grouting you must seal the marble's porous surface to increase its stain resistance.\nMany backsplash tiles are now available on pre-spaced sheets (roughly 10 inches square), which makes them much easier to use. A newer trend, especially for kitchen backsplashes, is so-called \"smart\" or peel-and-stick tile, which combines pre-spaced tile sheets with a self-adhesive backing mat.\nThe benefits of peel-and-stick tile are speed and simplicity. You don't need to spread a messy adhesive, you don't need to use tile spacers, and you can begin grouting immediately after the tile is placed.\nThe downsides: you're limited to the styles on hand, and you have to take care when setting the tile, because the adhesive is so sticky it makes it hard to re-set any misaligned sheets. (And you'll notice misalignments more because the entire sheet is affected.) Also, these tile sheets cost more per square foot than conventional tile.\nTile is often installed with thinset mortar. But for a backsplash wall, consider using tile mastic. It costs a bit more than conventional thinset, but it doesn't require mixing and it can be applied right from the can. In addition, mastic holds faster than thinset mortar, so there's less chance of the tile sliding down the wall while you're working.\nDon't use mastic with glass tiles; the impermeable tiles prevent the moisture in the mastic from evaporating, and the adhesive may discolor over time and be visible through the tile. The other drawback of mastic is that, because it sets up so quick, you may not be able to re-set misaligned tiles.\nThere are pre-mixed thinset mortars available that work well with glass and other tile materials. Be aware that thinsets take longer to dry, so take special care to use spacers for every tile to keep them from settling or shifting before the thinset dries.\nStep 1: sand the backsplash wall with 80-grit sandpaper; both thinset and tile mastic will adhere better to a roughened surface. Wipe away the sanding dust with a damp cloth.\nStep 2: apply the mastic or thinset to the wall with a notched trowel. The ridges created by the notched trowel will dramatically increase the adhesive's bond strength. Spread only enough for a few square feet of tile at a time (less if using small individual tiles). If you're using mastic and you notice that a skin forms on the surface, scrape the wall clean and apply a fresh coat—the skin means the mastic has started to dry and won't bond properly to the tile.\nStep 3: set the first course of tiles along the countertop at the bottom of the backsplash wall. Firmly press each tile into the mastic or thinset. Use plastic spacers to maintain uniform grout joints. The size of the spacers varies depending upon the size of the tile, but for backsplash tiles, you'll probably find yourself using 1/8- or 3/16-inch spacers.\nReminder: You'll need to cut and notch tiles to fit around electrical outlets, at corners, and anywhere a whole piece of tile won't fit. The best tool for that is a wet saw, which you can rent for about $50 a day. Make sure it has the proper blade for the tile material you chose; glass tile requires a specific glass diamond blade. Once all the tiles are installed, allow the mastic to cure at least overnight. Thinset mortars may take longer to fully dry; check the manufacturer's specifications. Remove tile spacers once the site has completely cured.\nStep 4: fill the joints between the tile with grout. Use sanded grout to fill any tile joints that are 1/8 inch or wider, and use an unsanded grout for narrower joints. For glass tiles, space them tightly and use unsanded or epoxy grout that won't scratch the tile surface. Mix the grout with water to the consistency of thick yogurt and apply it to the tile with a rubber grout float.\nSmear the grout diagonally across the tiles, forcing it deep into the joints and then wiping the excess from the surface. After grouting, clean the backsplash with a wet sponge, which helps press the grout fully into the joint and sets clean lines between tiles. Be careful not to pull any of the grout from the joints. Wait 30 minutes or so for the grout to set and for a hazy film to appear on the tile surface. Then buff the tiles clean with a dry cloth. Allow the grout to cure for at least two days, then seal the grout joints with silicone sealer if necessary.\n",
        "baseline": "Step 5: caulk the edges. Any joint or edge where the tile meets another surface like the countertop should be caulked, not grouted. Use a silicone caulk designed for kitchens and bathrooms, in a color that coordinates with your design. Cut the tube tip at an angle and squeeze a uniform bead of caulk into the joint. Make sure to move the tube at a constant rate to ensure consistent coverage. Then, go over the joint with a round-edged caulking tool to create a smooth, evenly radiused seal. Wipe excess on a rag or paper towel.\nStep 6: respace electrical outlets. With the added thickness of the new tile, your outlets will likely no longer be flush to the front of the backsplash. Respace them with outlet spacers, small plastic pieces that slip between the outlet and wall box. You may need slightly longer screws. Be sure to turn off power to the circuit at the main electrical box before working with outlets.",

        "prompt": "An informational meeting for parents is scheduled this week following the suicides of three Farragut High School students this semester.\nThree Farragut High School students have committed suicide this semester, including two within the past month, prompting Knox County Schools officials to schedule a meeting Thursday for parents to air their concerns and discuss a plan for moving forward.\nDozens of students gathered in the school's parking lot Monday night in remembrance of the latest victim, a senior who, according to a Knox County Sheriff's Office incident report, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his truck Friday night near Anchor Park in West Knox County.\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee has chosen not to identify the victims.\nThe death followed the suicide of a Farragut High School sophomore less than three weeks earlier. Another Farragut sophomore took his own life in January.\nAn online petition created after the second student's death is asking for an open and ongoing discussion of the issue with students, as well as an apology from school administrators for not addressing the situation earlier.\nThe change.org petition, authored by Farragut High School junior Catherine Miller, had garnered more than 2,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\nAfter the first student's death in January, \"(O)ur school swept it under the rug,\" Miller writes. \"Administration did not discuss it with anyone. Teachers proceeded with class the next day as if nothing ever happened. I am hesitant to believe if the situation, of even the topic of suicide and mental illness, was properly discussed we would not have to mourn two of our peers. Especially in one semester.\"\nThe Knox County Board of Education's policy states, in part, that following a student death by suicide, students, faculty and staff should be informed and grief counselors should be made available at the school.\nMiller said when she initially approached school officials in the wake of the second death last month, she was told that school protocol dictated that no student assembly or official acknowledgement could be made for three months. She said counselors, however, were at the school following the second suicide.\n\"The students and the parents just didn't know, we didn't know,\" she said. \"When I made this petition ... we wanted answers and we wanted justice.\"\nSchool board member Susan Horn, whose 5th district includes Farragut, said there was much more going on among school officials behind the scenes than what was shared with students or parents.\n\"I've heard from several parents that feel the administration is doing a very good job. I've probably heard from more parents who think they're doing a good job.\"\nGrief counselors are at the school this week, Knox County Schools spokeswoman Carly Harrington confirmed. Statewide standardized testing also was postponed at both Farragut High and Farragut Middle schools, she said.\nA letter from Farragut High School Principal Ryan Siebe was emailed to parents Sunday, inviting them to an informational meeting Thursday night to share concerns and \"hear our plans for future trainings on suicide for staff, students and families.\"\nA representative of the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network also will be on hand to offer advice on how to proceed, the letter states.\n\"You may have heard but I wanted to let you know that we have lost another one of our precious students this weekend,\" Siebe's letter begins. \"Parents, please talk to your sons and daughters your own way tonight and know that we will have counselors available all week to help them with this terrible loss at school.\"\nAdditionally, the letter says the senior awards, originally scheduled for Monday night, will be rescheduled to a later date. Advanced Placement exams will not be rescheduled, the letter notes, although support services will be made available to those students as well.\nSchool officials said Thursday's meeting will not be open to the media.\nA father of two Farragut High School students, who asked not to be identified because of concerns about his children's well-being, said the letter was the first communication to parents about the suicides from the school district.\nKnox County Schools Superintendent Bob Thomas said in a statement: \"Our hearts go out to the families, students, teachers, staff and community. The loss of life among any of our students weighs heavily on us all, but the loss of life as a result of suicide is devastating. It’s a public health issue that Knox County Schools takes very seriously. Our number one concern is for the students, and we have been working with experts to help guide us as we provide support to all impacted.\"\nIn a written statement provided to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee on Tuesday, Siebe states, \"We are deeply saddened by the recent tragedies at our school, and our support and condolences go out to the families.

Scott Walker waits backstage before speaking at the Freedom Summit, Jan. 24, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAs the governor of Wisconsin, Republican Scott Walker hasn’t had to deal much with foreign policy. That’s not his fault, of course – governors have plenty of important responsibilities, but foreign affairs aren’t among them – but now that Walker is poised to become a leading GOP presidential candidate, he’ll have to demonstrate some working understanding of the world.\nHe certainly seems eager to try. A Republican operative recently lobbed comically easy questions at Walker, such as, “You command the [Wisconsin] National Guard. I wondered if you might want to comment on how you feel about the threat posed by ISIS and other entities abroad?” Walker responded by delivering a lengthy, and probably rehearsed, answer about his extensive work on matters of national security, including classified briefings from FBI officials.\nOn ABC’s “This Week” yesterday, Martha Raddatz approached the same issue, but without the softballs.\nRADDATZ: Let’s talk about some specific, and you talk about leadership and you talk about big, bold, fresh ideas. What is your big, bold, fresh idea in Syria?\nWALKER: Well, I think – I go back to the red line.\nRADDATZ: Let’s not go back. Let’s go forward. What is your big, bold idea in Syria?\nWALKER: I think aggressively, we need to take the fight to ISIS and any other radical Islamic terrorist in and around the world, because it’s not a matter of when they attempt an attack on American soil, or not if I should say, it’s when, and we need leadership that says clearly, not only amongst the United States but amongst our allies, that we’re willing to take appropriate action. I think it should be surgical.\nAt this point, it apparently occurred to Walker that meaningless sound bites and catchphrases weren’t going to cut it.\nEvery White House hopeful goes through a learning process, and Walker wouldn’t be the first governor who struggled with foreign policy as his campaign got underway. The bigger problem is that the Wisconsin Republican doesn’t have a strong suit to lean on when the international questions get",

His record in his home state probably won’t help.\nOne of his biggest applause lines [in Iowa last week] was his mention that Wisconsin requires photo identification before voting.

Reporters have been working hard to ask Walker about his experience abroad and what he learned, but the governor still hasn’t put together a full answer.\nPut it this way: when you’re not even sure what you learned from your trip to Israel, it’s probably not a good sign that you’re ready to be president.

Democratic voters in 2016 will have a choice: a candidate with a strong record and an obvious appeal to a national coalition, or an alternative with a weak record and an obvious appeal to a narrow constituency.\nIf Walker is the nominee, his foreign-policy record will be an important piece of the equation.

Maybe he’ll get better and better with time and practice in this arena, or maybe he’ll just keep striking out. Regardless, Republican campaign strategists are likely to kick themselves for believing that a candidate with Walker’s limited experience in international affairs could be an acceptable presidential candidate. Perhaps, like former Texas Gov. Mitt Romney (R), he’ll eventually realize that he’s better served by stepping aside and waiting another election cycle.

When Markle wore a Stella McCartney cape dress for Queen Elizabeth II’s birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London last month, that label was suddenly a contender. But the subsequent choice of a bespoke Emilia Wickstead skirt suit for a commemoration service at Westminster Abbey a few days later proved equally tantalizing to royal watchers — especially because Wickstead created a universally admired wedding gown for the Duke of Wellington’s daughter, Charlotte Wellesley, two years ago.\nOther names being bandied about include Erdem, Burberry and Alexander McQueen; the last of those labels was responsible for the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress in 2011.\nMay. 18, 2018, 7:31 a.m.\nPrince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle at the royal wedding — stepping in after the father of the bride fell ill just days before the ceremony.\nMay. 18, 2018, 7:00 a.m.\nIt’s a simple and oft-overlooked accessory, but between Rihanna’s bishop’s mitre at the May 7 Met Gala in New York and the fascinator frenzy sparked by Saturday’s British royal wedding where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot amid a sea of stylish headgear, the hat is making a comeback.\nMay. 17, 2018, 4:25 p.m.\nRoyal weddings have long been occasions of fascination and splendor.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is a fortuitously timed distraction from the disturbing deterioration of our own democracy, which appears to be crumbling like the British Empire we once fought to escape. But it's also a curious escape hatch given that the last few royal nuptials to elicit this much attention from American TV audiences were hardly idyllic or dreamy affairs.\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" blood-soaked \"Red Wedding\" is still at the top of that list, followed by King Joffrey's less bloody but still colorful demise.

His reporting failures included articles in prestigious publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet as well as in Cancer Discovery, a journal for which he serves as one of two editors in chief.\nDr. Baselga acknowledged that he had frequently failed to disclose industry connections, and said he planned to correct the record in 17 recent articles. But he disputed whether he should have disclosed his ties in dozens of other cases, saying that the articles involved early-stage research for which there was little financial implication for companies.\nSeveral institutions, including The New England Journal of Medicine and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, have said they are looking into his disclosures. The American Association for Cancer Research said it had also begun a review of Dr. Baselga’s reporting practices. Dr. Baselga appears to have violated disclosure rules while he was president of that organization in 2015 and 2016. The A.A.C.R. also publishes Cancer Discovery.\nIn the email, Dr. Thompson and Ms. Martin described the guidelines for reporting industry relationships as “nebulous,” adding that “we need to work with journal publishers and professional societies to standardize the reporting process.” They said they had been discussing the issue with ASCO, the cancer group, which has pushed for more standardized disclosure.\nA decade ago, a series of scandals relating to hidden payments by drug companies to prominent physicians prompted medical journals and professional societies to beef up their reporting requirements. But as Dr. Baselga’s case and others demonstrate, much is still left to the honor system. Medical journals have said they don’t routinely fact-check authors’ disclosures.\nIn comments to The Times and ProPublica, The New England Journal of Medicine acknowledged that the problem of failed disclosures is “widespread” and said it was putting in place a better system to track authors’ disclosures. Two of the articles that Dr. Baselga said he planned to correct were published in that journal.\nDr. Baselga has served since March on the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb, a major manufacturer of cancer drugs, and since 2017 on the board of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment to cancer centers, including to Memorial Sloan Kettering.\nDr. Baselga received nearly $3.5 million in payments from drug, medical equipment and diagnostic companies from August 2013 through 2017, according to Open Payments, a",

        "prompt": "Alabama has begun routing wireless 911 calls over a statewide IP network in the first phase of its Next Generation Emergency Network (ANGEN).\nThe state's IP Next Generation 911 network will not be fully up and running until well beyond the original 18-month timetable, pointing up the need to set realistic goals in pioneering tech programs. Read more.\nWhen completed, ANGEN will be one of the first statewide IP 911 routing systems in the nation, cutting costs and improving reliability for traditional emergency voice calls, and laying the groundwork for the use of advanced text, video and data services. The first public safety answering point (PSAP) was put on the network Sept. 30, and by early November seven PSAPs were up and running, receiving wireless calls from T-Mobile, the first carrier connected to the network.\nOther national and regional wireless carriers are expected to join the network in the near term, but full operational capability for ANGEN with both mobile and traditional wireline calls at all 115 answering points in the state is probably three years off, said Jason Jackson, executive director of the state’s 911 board.\nThat will be several years beyond the initial — and ambitious —18-month timeline for the project. But Alabama still will be in select company with one of the first, if not the only, statewide system in the country, said Kevin Breault, vice president of emergency services products for Bandwidth, the project’s 911 services provider.\n“It’s a long process to overhaul and rebuild an existing 911 infrastructure,” Breault said. “The technology is the easy part.” Funding and coordinating the shift to new protocols among hundreds of PSAPs and the national, regional and local wired and wireless service providers is the real challenge.\nWhen it is completed, the legacy system of seven selective 911 voice routers from CenturyLink and AT&T will be collapsed into a single consolidated network, the Alabama Research and Education Network operated by the Alabama Supercomputer Authority. It will be served by redundant routers at supercomputer centers in Huntsville and Montgomery to provide resiliency.\nWhen a 911 call is made from a participating carrier it will be directed to one of the two points of presence in Huntsville or Montgomery. From there the call will be routed to the appropriate PSAP. The routing function is provided by Bandwidth. The appropriate PSAP is determined by location information that is forwarded by the carrier along with the call. This information also is forwarded to the PSAP and displayed on a console when the call is received.\nThe state has a history of leadership in 911 services, claiming the nation’s first 911 call in 1968 over a local system in the town of Haleyville just a month after AT&T announced designation of 911 as a national emergency number and two weeks before AT&T implemented its first 911 system in Indiana.\nMore than 40 years later, the state’s circuit-switched copper-wire system was struggling to keep up with telecom advances that included wireless mobile phones and Voice over IP. “We’ve put on Band-Aid after Band-Aid,” Jackson said.\nTo provide a comprehensive fix, Alabama applied for 911 improvement grants in 2009 under a $40 million program through the Transportation and Commerce departments. Cost was estimated at $460,000 for two routers and about $1.4 million to build out last-mile connections to each of the 115 answering points for a total cost of $1.9 million. The state received $950,000 in federal grants and committed another $950,000 of its own money, largely from a fund established originally to improve wireless 911 capabilities.\nWork on the system began in June 2012. Wireless traffic is being moved onto the new system in Phase 1 because it accounts for the majority of emergency calls in Alabama, as much as 70 percent in some places.\nPhase 2 of the ANGEN transition will begin in early 2014 by bringing in wireline calls, as well.\nThe first PSAP to tap into the IP network was Etowah County in northeastern Alabama on Sept. 30, followed by the city of Dothan in the southeast part of the state two days later. “Once the first two were done the learning curve was dramatically less, and we are turning them on much more quickly now,” Jackson said. The biggest achievement with the IP network to date is that the call takers can’t see any difference in the service. “Which is a win for us,” Jackson said.\nAs additional PSAPs, carriers and types of digital media are brought online, the system is expected to move beyond parity with the legacy. One of the first advantages will be the ability to transfer calls easily from one answering center to another. Presently, only those PSAPs that have mutual agreements can transfer calls if one center is unavailable or a call is misdirected. With the digital system, “we can transfer a call anywhere in the state with one click,” Jackson said.\nThe ultimate goal of Next Generation 911 is to combine voice, video, text and data on a single emergency communications platform, to let callers use the services they are accustomed to on their smart phones and other devices when making emergency calls, as well as provide additional information to first responders.\n“With the legacy tandem servers we couldn’t take in video or text messages,” Jackson said. Technically that would be possible with the new system, but “we don’t know how",
        "baseline": " to handle it.” He estimates it will be about three years before ANGEN is fully implemented, and incorporation of digital media in 911 services can become a reality.\nFull implementation of NG911 nationally will take even longer, Breault said. “It’s a good 10 years away,” although there will be pockets of functionality such as Alabama and smaller regions well before then.\nThe digital signaling and routing for 911 is not difficult, he said. “What we are doing now is what has already occurred in the commercial world.” But 911 services are lagging the commercial world by 10 to 15 years.\nThe biggest reason for the lag is that 911 systems are publicly funded. That means money often is tight; budgeting cycles make planning for large-scale projects difficult; and fragmented infrastructure, administration and budgeting complicate large-scale roll-out of new services. But as soon as the plans and budgets are ready, the technology will be available.",

The system would be used to send text messages to cell phones and other devices, as well as to broadcast alerts over radio and television stations.\nThe state also is working with the Alabama Department of Transportation to develop a statewide emergency alert system that would be used to warn the public of impending natural disasters, such as tornadoes, or other emergencies, such as a chemical spill.

But when he got Total's standard reply \"skirting round the issues\", Robertson decided to do something a little more dramatic. He climbed up the outside of the 324-metre Eiffel Tower without ropes.\nThe Wareham-based photojournalist is known in climbing circles around the world for his bold exploits, in particular climbing unroped on sea cliffs, a new form of the sport called deep-water soloing.\nIt was while researching a climbing trip to Burma that Robertson became aware of the scale of human rights abuses there and decided to forget his holiday and get involved. He had already planned a break in Paris when he got his letter from Total last week, and decided on the spur of the moment to step up his campaigning.\n\"I thought about climbing the Total building instead,\" Robertson said. \"The climbing looked all right but it's a bit tucked away up there in La Défense, whereas the Eiffel Tower is super-public.\"\nRobertson and a friend spent an hour on a park bench on Monday below the tower watching the movements of security forces and drawing a slogan on a T-shirt. \"I nipped into a public loo, put the T-shirt on and my rock-climbing shoes, and scampered up to this little pigeon ledge at 25ft.\"\nOnce established on the tower, Robertson climbed quickly to the first difficult section, a nearly two-metre (5ft) overhang at 90 metres.\nFacing the certainty that a fall would kill him, Robertson crossed the overhang, pulling himself up on a piece of aluminium riveted to the iron structure that he said creaked as it took his weight. \"I do so much soloing, though, and to be honest, that bit of aluminium was probably stronger than some of the rock I pull on.

        "prompt": "Coming off a needed palette-cleansing victory in the Carabao Cup, Tottenham Hotspur look to begin the business of closing the distance between themselves and leaders Manchester City on Saturday when they face struggling Wolverhampton at Molineux.\nTottenham Hotspur (7-0-3) had a pair of matches to forget, first being held to a 2-2 draw at PSV Eindhoven in Champions League play that all but scuttled their hopes for advancing to the knockout round despite having three matches remaining. The hangover continued Monday at Wembley Stadium, where the Lilywhites never fully recovered from a sixth-minute goal scored by Riyad Mahrez as they fell 1-0 to the reigning champions.\nManager Mauricio Pochettino's lineup deserved some scrutiny, most notably in the form of selecting Moussa Sissoko for the left wing in Spurs' 4-2-3-1 set-up when a creative tandem of Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela was there in the offering. It was Lamela, though, who was left to rue his scuffed chance during the final quarter-hour, the ball taking a slight skip on the worn Wembley pitch before he sent his shot for the upper left corner well over the bar.\nThe loss dropped Spurs five points behind City, but for all intents and purposes, it feels like 50 given the chasm in quality the Citizens enjoyed for a good portion of the match before Spurs desperately chased - and nearly caught - an equaliser late. While it would be easy to use playing at Wembley for a second straight season as an excuse since the re-opening of White Hart Lane has now been pushed back to January, defender Toby Alderweireld said his team cannot lament what has been.\n\"We never used Wembley as an excuse and we will not do that now,\" Alderweireld told Sky Sports. \"But it has affected us. I am grateful to play at Wembley, it is a very historical place, but it is not the same feeling as White Hart Lane. There we had a special home feeling.\n\"But in that way, we did very well to be successful at Wembley. But I know the club is doing everything in their power to play as quickly as possible in our stadium.\"\nThat is what made Wednesday's 3-1 victory at West Ham United to reach the Carabao Cup quarterfinals so vital to getting rid of the negative vibes. Heung-Min Son had a brace on either side of halftime for his first two goals of the season, and the relief was palpable for the South Korea international as he celebrated the goal with Pochettino.\n\"You feel sorry when a player works hard and does not get rewarded and Sonny has been ready to work more and more to change his situation,\" the gaffer told The Times. \"I never usually celebrate the goal but was a little worried for him.\"\nFernnado Llorente helped Spurs see out the match with a goal shortly after West Ham pulled within 2-1, and the spoils of the win included another London derby in the round of eight, this time against Arsenal and Pochettino's old friend and new Gunners manager Unai Emery.\nAs the preparations continue to eventually move back to White Hart Lane, Spurs did lock up an important piece of the side's nucleus to play there for years to come by extending Alli's contract through 2024. He joins striker Harry Kane and keeper Hugo Lloris as the only players with a wage packet of at least £100,000 per week, and it may also put to rest the rumours of Pochettino taking the Real Madrid job that opened up following the sacking of Julen Lopetegui.\n\"He's a massive part of wanting to be at this club,\" Alli said of Pochettino. \"The fans are amazing, the chairman, everyone, the whole club is amazing. But as players, you work with the gaffer, you want to have a good relationship with the manager and we all feel like we've got that here.\n\"We all love the way we work. The style of play, we all want to be a part of it. He's done a lot for me so far and hopefully he can keep helping me to improve.\"\nAfter an impressive start to the season in which they lost just one of their first eight matches, new boys Wolverhampton have come back down to earth some with back-to-back losses. The Wolves (4-3-3) continue to struggle offensively - their nine goals are the fewest of any club in the top half of the table - and have gone 214 minutes without a tally following their 1-0 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion last weekend.\n\"We've got a tough week ahead in training, improving on Brighton because we need to get back to winning ways,\" centre back and talisman Conor Coady told the Birmingham Mail. \"It's been an OK start for us, we've won a couple but we've been beat the last two games which isn't a nice feeling at all.\"\nCoach Nuno Espirito Santo may attempt further changes for the second straight contest after finally altering his starting XI for the first time last weekend. Adama Traore, however, failed to make much of an impact as right wing back Matt Doherty had the side's two best chances at AMEX Stadium.\nCoady is hoping the prime-time kickoff will give a boost to the team through their supporters as Wolves have claimed eight points through their first five home contests (2-2-1) in the top flight.\n\"What it",
        "baseline": " does do is get you looking forward to a game under the lights,\" Coady told the club's official website. \"There's nothing better than a game under the lights, it's brilliant, especially here at Molineux, because the crowd are electric at the best of times.\"\nWolves do not have any injuries of note, while Spurs continue to be without central defender Jan Vertonghen. With Eriksen and Alli playing 83 and 63 minutes, respectively, versus West Ham, Sissoko and Lamela are likely to be restored to Pochettino's first XI.\nThis will be the first meeting between the clubs since Wolves were last in the top flight in 2011-12. Tottenham are unbeaten in the last four matchups (2-2-0) and are 4-2-2 against them in the Premier League era.

        "prompt": "Diversity On 'The Walking Dead' Wasn't Always Handled Well AMC's hit zombie drama The Walking Dead airs its midseason finale Sunday. It's now one of TV's most diverse shows, but critic Eric Deggans says it hasn't always served non-white characters well.\nAMC's \"The Walking Dead\" has been scoring top ratings with young TV viewers. This Sunday, the show airs its midseason finale. It's taking a break until February. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans has been watching the show, and as he explains, \"The Walking Dead\" is a prime example of a show that learned how to handle diversity right after a few seasons of getting it wrong. And, be warned, there be spoilers ahead.\nERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: The \"Walking Dead\" recently aired a scene which could be considered the show's manifesto. It was delivered by a character named Bob Stookey, talking to hero Rick Grimes about keeping your humanity in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.\nLAWRENCE GILLIARD: (As Bob Stookey) We push ourselves to let things go. Then we let some more go. And if you let too much go along the way, that's not going to work.\nANDREW LINCOLN: (As Rick Grimes) This is the real world, Bob.\n>>GILLIARD (As Bob Stookey) Nah. This is a nightmare, and nightmares end.\nDEGGANS: But what I noticed was that the scene included five characters, and Rick was the only white person on screen. \"The Walking Dead\" has quietly assembled one of the most ethnically diverse casts on a top-rated TV show. It has at least seven major non-white characters, including Michonne, a sword-swinging African-American heroine and fan favorite. Danai Gurira, the actress who plays Michonne, explains her characters pivotal role on AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" aftershow, \"Talking Dead.\"\nDANAI GURIRA: She's the person who will step in at those moments when someone really needs to step in. She steps in and goes and helps to get the medicine. She steps in, you know, and stabs the governor when he's trying to kill Rick.\nDEGGANS: When the show first started, critics like me argued its two African-American characters didn't reflect the diversity of its setting around Atlanta, Georgia, with a population that's more than 50 percent black. And the racial conflicts on the show were often cartoonish, as shown by this fight between white Southerner Merle Dixon and a black man, Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas.\nROBERT SINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) You got something you want to tell me?\nJUAN GABRIEL PAREJA: (As Morales) Hey, T-Dog, man, just leave it.\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) No.\nMICHAEL ROOKER: (As Merle Dixon) You want to know today? It's the day I take orders from a [bleep].\nPAREJA: (As Morales) Hey, come on, Merle, that's enough.\nDEGGANS: For a while, T-Dog was the show's only black character, given little backstory and few lines. He even complained about his situation, but only when he was delirious from an infection.\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) And I'm the one black guy. Realize how precarious that makes my situation?\nJEFFREY DEMUNN: (As Dale Horvath) What the hell are you talking about?\nSINGLETON: (As Theodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas) I'm talking about two good ol' boy cowboy sheriffs and a redneck whose brother cut off his own hand because I dropped a key.

They're fully fleshed out characters, created as \"The Walking Dead\" has become the most popular series on TV with the young demographic advertisers crave.

It releases its albums, including the recent “Techarí” (“Free”) and a follow-up album of remixes, on its own label, Diquela Records (distributed here by Six Degrees).\nA Gypsy guitarist, Ramón Giménez, and a heel-stamping dancer, Sonia Poveda, connect the band to Barcelona’s flamenco tradition, and Ms. Abad sometimes sings in a Spanish Gypsy dialect. Flamenco plus Afro-Cuban percussion leads Ojos de Brujo to the rumba-flamenco that’s a big part of European pop.\nBut the band doesn’t stop there. Its songs also use funk vamps, ska and reggae beats, Indian tabla drumming, hard-rock riffs, hip-hop turntable scratching and live beatboxing. There’s also rapid-fire rapping from Ms. Azad, DJ Panko and the band’s founder and main songwriter, the percussionist Xavier Turull, who sometimes plays the traditional box-shaped drum used for flamenco, the cajón.\nOnstage, Ojos de Brujo played as if musical energy could drive a revolution. A video screen behind the band showed crumbling neighborhoods, time-lapse accelerated sequences of pedestrian and auto traffic, or images of war: planes, soldiers, explosions.\nSongs rarely stayed in just one style. Ms. Abad, in a Gypsy-Indian headdress and a yellow feather boa, sang with clear pop tone, raspy Gypsy declamations or floating, quasi-Indian phrases.

But passages of traditionalist flamenco, with Mr. Giménez accompanied by six-beat handclapping, were soon overlaid with DJ Panko’s scratching or Javier Martin’s thumb-popping bass lines.\nPolitical fervor fills Ojos de Brujo’s lyrics, which praise Latin American revolutionaries like Bolivar and Zapata in “Tanguillos Marineros” and denounce “megamacromultinacionales” in “El Confort No Reconforta.” But like many of its counterparts worldwide — from AfroReggae in Brazil to Antibalas in New York — the band pushes just as determinedly toward the dance floor as to the barricades.",

Unbeknownst to Po, Taotie is an old enemy of Shifu's and this invitation was all he needed to seek his revenge. In the second episode premiering on Tuesday, Nov. 8 at 5:30 p.m., \"Chain Reaction,\" Po is driving Tigress nuts with his fanboy ways while they are on a mission together. Things get worse when they are attacked by Croc Bandits and wind up handcuffed together. The two have to learn how to work together to evade the bandits and save their skins.\nIn the next two brand-new episodes, \"Fluttering Finger Mindslip\" (premiering Nov. 9) leads Po to discover a rare secret move which causes temporary memory loss, but things get out of hand when he uses it on the Furious Five. Then, in \"Hometown Hero\" (premiering Nov. 10), Po visits Mantis' hometown and discovers that Mantis hasn't been entirely honest with the villagers.\nIn support of the series premiere, Nickelodeon's multi-platform efforts include sneak peeks, image galleries and promotional content that will stream on Nick.com as well as Nick's wireless partners.

        "prompt": "People who are physically or mentally challenged often live in group homes, small residential facilities in the general community that ideally have six or fewer occupants who are watched over by trained caregivers 24 hours per day. Turnover of group homes staff members is quite high for a variety of reasons, including burnout and low pay.\nThe early 20th-century eugenics movement saw people with disabilities as genetically flawed and supported incarcerating them in large, crowded state institutions. Nazi Germany systematically killed institutionalized physically and mentally disabled people. In the United States, a national movement advocating the closure of large state institutions began in the 1960s. Many physically and mentally challenged people moved into group homes, some run by state governments and others by private organizations.\nAn estimated 4.3 million Americans with intellectual, developmental or physical disabilities live in group homes, their own homes or with family members, according to the federal Health and Human Services Department. Their disabilities include autism, Down syndrome, mental illness and many other medical conditions. Disabled persons living in group homes and some of those living in their own homes are cared for by staff called direct support professionals or DSPs. They are also referred to as home health and personal care aides. DSPs working in group homes and providing in-home care have high turnover rates. A 2006 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, \"The Supply of Direct Support Professionals Serving Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and Other Developmental Disabilities,\" estimated that the national turnover rate for DSPs working in group homes and in-home care was 53.6 percent between 1998 and 2003.\nA 2001 study, \"Issues in the Direct Support Workforce,\" produced by the American Network of Community Options and Resources, analyzes the reasons why turnover among DSPs working in group homes is so high. Prior to the 1960s, DSPs were typically government employees working for large state institutions. While some state institutions were brutal, mismanaged and overcrowded, DSPs had structured jobs and were often trained and supervised by medical personnel in carrying out a variety of planned programs. The shift to small group houses that are frequently run by private organizations has left many DSPs lacking needed training and supervision in an era when the medical complexity of care needed by intellectually and physically disabled persons has increased. In addition, DSP jobs are seen by most Americans as poorly paid, low status, lacking promotion opportunities and offering few employee benefits, leading to high turnover and chronic understaffing. DSPs are paid a median yearly salary of $20,170",
        "baseline": ".\nThe average DSP is a woman between the ages of 18 to 39. A third of all DSPs have college degrees, and many are minorities or recent immigrants to the United States. Faced with physically and emotionally demanding responsibilities, overwork due to staff shortages, inadequate training, low pay, few opportunities for advancement and sometimes receiving no employee benefits such as health insurance and vacation time, many leave the profession for other jobs. Job vacancies for DSPs are projected to grow by 70 percent between 2010 and 2020, due to the aging of the baby boomers. A Montgomery County, Maryland, study of DSPs found that agencies that paid their DSPs $10 per hour or higher showed dramatically lower turnover and vacancy rates. Securing added funding for DSP salaries is a complex problem as much of the care for persons with disabilities is controlled by state and federal budgets.\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Nazi Persecution of the Disabled -- Murder of the \"Unfit\"",

But now, researchers led by Brian MacGowan of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California have managed to squeeze targets of material into spheres rather than pancakes or more lopsided shapes, paving the way for future attempts at fusion.\nThe work was performed at Livermore’s 192-laser beam National Ignition Facility (NIF), which began operating in 2009.\nThe team used targets that did not contain the key ingredients for fusion – two isotopes of hydrogen known as deuterium and",

Now they’re pausing to mount new instruments on the 10-centimetre-thick aluminium target chamber and to install giant concrete doors to contain neutrons they expect to produce in future fusion experiments.\nIn a few months, they will begin testing a series of new targets designed to assess beam interactions and compression.

The results showed that the fuel was compressed into a sphere, rather than a pancake or other irregular shape.\nThe team also measured the temperature of the fuel using a technique called Thomson scattering, which uses lasers to measure the temperature of a plasma.

And then he hung up,” Melissa recalled, speaking of their final phone conversation before she returned home.\nNationwide, statistics show that more police officers are dying from suicide than from on-duty deaths. A 2018 study by the Ruderman Family Foundation, a private philanthropic organization, found that in 2017 there were 129 police officers killed in the line of duty compared to 140 officer suicides. The group found that little has been done nationwide to deal with mental health issues like PTSD and depression within police ranks.\nSince her husband’s death, Melissa has talked openly about her story in hopes of preventing more officer suicides, even being featured in a PSA for the LAPD, which has been working to reduce those rising numbers.\nThe department’s unique Behavioral Science Services unit, known as BSS, is on a mission to end suicides. A staff of 16 psychologists has one goal: treating the minds of close to 10,000 LAPD officers in an effort to prevent suicidal or violent and harmful behavior.\nLike many departments, LAPD officers are mandated to see a psychologist after a shooting or a major incident, but having in-house psych services makes seeing a doctor a slightly less scary experience for the many officers who might otherwise avoid “shrinks” because of the stigma associated with them. BSS is celebrating its 50th year in service, and the unit will mark the occasion with a ceremony in October.\n(Melissa Swailes) David Swailes at an LAPD Special Olympics event.\n“Officers can come in and see us anytime,” said Denise Jablonski-Kaye, PhD, a psychologist in the LAPD’s Behavioral Sciences Services Unit, who sat down with ABC News at police headquarters to talk about the unit’s objectives.\n“We don’t charge for services. We even validate officers’ parking. There’s no cap on the number of sessions that they can have. And they’re talking to somebody who talks their language, who understands their job, who understands the agency,” she explained.\nBSS is the longest running in-house police psych unit in the country. Psychologists on staff spend time at LAPD stations, go on ride-alongs, deploy to the field to help officers during stressful events and employ early intervention methods to recognize officers who may be in the primary stages of stress, addiction and anxiety issues. LAPD personnel can also call BSS to check on officers who might be showing signs of problems in their lives.\nFor officers who need help, doctors are available around the clock.\nMembers of BSS have to walk a fine line where they’re not prematurely sidelining an officer just because they might be having a bad day or because something in their lives is making them emotional — they have to make sure the person actually poses a danger to themselves or others.\n(Melissa Swailes) The Swailes family enjoying an LAPD picnic.\nEven if an officer has their service weapon taken away, they are able to get it back and return to the field after treatment, once they’re cleared by doctors and department leadership.\n“We absolutely have people right now, here today, who have had their gun taken away, and returned, and they’re back on the job. They’re doing well. They’re happy and healthy. This was a moment in time that was terrible and awful for them, but they got through it,” said Jablonski-Kaye.\nThe cause of the officers’ stress doesn’t always have to be on the job, either. Many officers seek help from BSS because of issues at home, and it’s still all free and confidential.\n“The main issues that they come for are relationship problems, and that’s what you generally see in the general population as well. Their relationship isn’t going well. They",

It’s usually relationship problems,” according to Jablonski-Kaye.\n(Melissa Swailes) David Swailes taking a selfie on patrol.\nThe LAPD has historically seen about two suicides per year within its ranks, but there has not been a suicide in the department since July 2017. “My mission really has been zero suicides in [the] LAPD,” Jablonski-Kaye said.\n“The year that we lost David Swailes we also lost a female detective, and both deaths had a very significant impact on the department. Both of these deaths caught us all by surprise, and for me, I felt that I needed to do more, have a greater impact, and work to get the department to really see saving our officers as a priority,” she added.",

Warner Jr. was killed in late 1944 in Germany, and he was buried at Adrennes American Cemetery in Neupré, Belgium.\nMERRITT ISLAND — In late 1944, intense enemy gunfire pinned down U.S. Army 1st Lt. William A. Warner Jr.'s infantry company near an undisclosed German village, during the waning months of World War II.\nMoving at the head of his troops, Warner led his squad on a daring assault targeting the enemy strongpoint. But he was cut down by machine-gun fire — creating questions that remain unanswered to his relatives a full 74 years later.\nWednesday morning, Warner's daughter, Jeanne Hall, was finally awarded his Silver Star, Purple Heart and other long-belated military honors during a solemn ceremony at the Brevard Veterans Memorial Center.\nHall was just 3 years old when her father was killed overseas at age 30. She received the medals and a flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol in her father's memory from Rob Medina, U.S. Rep. Bill Posey's director of community and military relations.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, to me this was an emotional moment. It brings back the life and memory of a hero. And that's what this nation was founded on,\" Medina told the audience.\n\"He placed his life in a leadership capacity on the altar of freedom. Freedom is not free. Blood is shed. And Lt. Warner shed his blood so that we can be free,\" Medina said.\n\"We honor you, Miss Hall, for the sacrifices laid on that altar by your father,\" he said.\nAn Alabama native, Hall lives in Melbourne Beach. The retiree who works as an H&R Block enrolled agent never knew much about her father's war years — \"just how sad my grandmother and my mother were,\" she recalled.\n\"My grandmother's three children all went off to war. My aunt was a Navy nurse. And my father's brother served in World War II and the Korean War,\" Hall said.\n\"I had made inquiries in the past, and my mother had, but there was no information at that time,\" she said of her late father's military service.\nMore than a year ago, Hall's friend Charlotte Neal — who attended Huntsville High with her in Alabama — contacted Posey's office and asked for research help. However, Medina said only limited historical resources were available.\n\"A lot of the information regarding the circumstances surrounding 1st Lt. Warner were destroyed in a fire back in 1973 from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis,\" Medina told the crowd.\n\"But they persevered. And we were able to obtain those documents to confirm his gallantry,\" he said.\nIn addition to the Silver Star and Purple Heart, Hall received her father's European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one bronze service star, World War II Victory Medal and Presidential Unit Citation. Medina also pinned a Gold Star Lapel Button to her royal-blue blouse.\nVolunteers will help Hall get a shadow box to display the medals, said Donn Weaver, chairman of the Brevard Veterans Council.\nWarner was buried in 1945",

She denied having offered an apology to settle the matter and called for the inquiry into Mr Austin to also be halted.\nIn an interview with the Evening Standard, Barking MP Dame Margaret – who is herself Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust – said the Labour Party had become a “hostile environment for Jews”.\nAsked if she believed there was a “purge” of Mr Corbyn’s critics under way, she replied: “I have absolutely no doubt that there are those in the leadership who want to get rid, whether it is through deselection or disciplinary action, of any opposition.\nThe Hamlins letter, dated August 1 and published on Tuesday on Mr Austin’s Twitter feed, said that the Dudley MP, whose adoptive father was a Jewish refugee from the Nazis, had been subjected to a “Kafkaesque” disciplinary process.\nA letter on July 19 informing him that he was under investigation for “abusive conduct” in Parliament, gave no details of the alleged incident, but “senior party sources” were quoted in the press claiming that he had intimidated party chairman Ian Lavery.\nIn a July 24 meeting with chief whip Nick Brown, he was told that complaints had been made by Mr Lavery and left-wing MP Chris Williamson.\nA letter from Mr Brown two days later said there had been complaints that he “approached other MPs unasked and asserted your point of view in a loud and aggressive manner, thereby creating an incident”.\nMr Brown also said there had been “other incidents of a similar nature”. He formally warned Mr Austin against “any repeat of such behaviour” and issued a reprimand for what he said were “a number of complaints”.\nHamlins said it was “completely inappropriate and contrary to the rules of natural justice” for Mr Austin to have been issued with a warning and reprimand without being given details of the allegations against him or an opportunity to defend himself.\nThe lawyers demanded immediate details of the substance of complaints and the identity of the person conducting any investigation, as well as an assurance that the probe would not be led by anyone from Mr Corbyn’s office.\nThe inquiry into Dame Margaret came after a heated exchange last month in which she was said to have called Mr Corbyn an",

Now that some of the better teams in the National League have seen what the American League has experienced for nearly half a season, why prolong the agony?\nSeven games from midseason, the Yankees have a 55-19 record and continue to hammer the team in the other dugout. In the week after their worst stretch of the first half of the season (four victories, five losses), the Yankees won three of four games from the National League-best Atlanta Braves and the first two games of the Mets series, from which they have wrenched the promised excitement because they are so good.\n''They're such a well-balanced club,'' Mike Piazza, the Mets' catcher, said with admiration after the Yankees won convincingly yesterday at Shea Stadium, 7-2.\nThe Mets did some things wrong, but so did the Yankees, and the Mets still could not beat them. The Yankees uncharacteristically made three errors, but the Mets were able to score only one run with them. The Mets committed two errors, and the Yankees scored six runs as a result.\n''I dropped that ball, then they got a hit and a home run, and before you know it, we're down by two,'' said the Mets' John Olerud, talking about his dropped throw at first base in the fourth inning that preceded Darryl Strawberry's single and a home run by Tino Martinez, the Yankees' second decisive three-run home run in the series.\nIn the seventh inning, Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez hit Jorge Posada with the ball when he tried to throw him out at third base, and the Yankees proceeded to score three more runs and make the Mets wonder if they could do anything to salvage the last game of the series tonight.\nOn Friday night, Piazza said, ''We had them on the ropes and weren't able to punch a big inning.''

But the Braves won primarily with pitching and at times found themselves short in other areas. The Yankees short in any area? If they are, no one has uncovered it yet.\nSo can anyone beat this team?\nBut even Cone acknowledged that the Yankees have an uncanny knack for having a different player or players step up each game and get the big hit or make the big play or throw the big pitch that results in a victory.\nThe Yankees behave themselves.

        "prompt": "CENTRAL Queensland fishermen believe government mismanagement is behind an explosion in the number of large sharks in popular fishing spots off the Capricorn Coast.\nThey are speaking out as debate rages over the rollout of baited drumlines around the Whitsundays' Cid Harbour in response to a fatal attack this week.\nThe not-for-profit Jolly Roger Fishing Club has condemned continuing mismanagement of local waters by the Queensland Government.\nThey believe traditional practices, which included fishing for sharks around boats, maintained an environmental balance which has been thrown out of whack by declaring them a protected species.\n\"20 years ago, there'd be three or four big sharks across all of Swains reef and dozens of little ones,\" JRFC supporter, Neill Xxavier said.\n\"Now there are five or six bull sharks, 12 feet and over, at every anchorage, big enough to eat two people in one bite.\"\n\"And to add insult to injury, every time there's a kneejerk reaction to a shark attack, the government's waiving the protected status and culling the wrong species,\" adds commercial fisherman, Ryan Cowley.\nThe activist groups Sea Shepherd, Shark Conservation Australia and the Humane Society are mounting campaigns against the practice which, they argue, indiscriminately kills other marine life and potentially attracts sharks to the area.\nMeanwhile, the Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries Minister Mark Furner is campaigning to entice overseas investment in aquaculture farms which will directly compete with commercial reef fishing.\nAccording to the Jolly Rogers, the Government allows private corporations to snap up the quotas which regulate how many tonnes of tuna can be fished in a given year.\n\"Once we've reached our reduced quota, they charge us $6/kilo which is just about what the fish reach on the market,\" says Mr Cowley.\n\"We might as well sit at home on the dole rather than pay to run our boats for no return.\"\nThe collective is also up in arms over the mandatory satellite tracking systems (VMS) which, at a cost of nearly $500 per boat to purchase and $44/month to operate, may comprimise their income and their intellectual property.\n\"There's no way to fix the VMS boxes at sea so, if one of them fails, we have five days by law to return to land,\" says JRFC's Stephanie Foote.\n",

It’s the art of chasing not trophy bass nor trout, but tiny species most fishermen regard as bait, if they regard them at all.\nHansell’s rod is so small it collapses to fit in a pocket. His hook? So minuscule as to be nearly invisible. And he’s brought an almost embarrassing surplus, a whole cup of wigglers he retrieved from the back of his fridge. He cracks the lid of the cardboard cup and shrugs. Today he will need only a tiny chunk of flesh to bait his hook. His entire expedition won’t require even one whole worm.\nMicrofishing involves line fishing for species that rarely grow above a few inches in length, some warier and rarer than others. The activity has been slowly attracting a devoted following in the U.S. The Midwest contains a healthy concentration of microfishing enthusiasts.\n“People are interested in something novel, something new,” says Ben Cantrell, who started the website micro-fishing.com.\nHansell, an avid angler who has been microfishing for about a year, chooses a trickle of water off the main stream, peering into puddle-depth pools.\nWithin minutes, he feels a tug and hoists his thrashing quarry from the stream, slick, wet, shining in the sun. He holds up a fish barely longer than one joint of his finger. Hansell identifies him as a blackstripe top minnow and slides him back into the stream.\nMicrofishermen understand why their sport is a bit of a head-scratcher for",
        "baseline": " the rest of the sport fishing community.\nStewart, whose website specializes in tenkara, a Japanese form of fly fishing, first discovered microfishing through Japanese tanago fishing, in which anglers pursue different species of tanago (bitterling) in order to catch the smallest fish possible.\nIn 2012, as tenkara fishing began to catch on in the U.S., Stewart added a line of tanago fishing gear to his inventory, unsure whether anyone else would share his fascination with catching tiny fish. He quickly discovered that a community of microfishermen already existed. Among them was Cantrell, a mechanical engineer, who started microfishing in 2008.\nTo pursue new species, anglers must research available species in each waterway and then cross-reference their catch with field guides and other fishermen for positive identification.\nMicrofishing involves line fishing for species that rarely grow above a few inches in length, some warier and rarer than others.",

It’s a challenge to pull a fish from a still surface with a line so thin it’s invisible. It’s a chance to see the world through a different lens, to go fishing for the sole purpose of going fishing.\n“It’s a way to be in nature and get away and get some quiet time,” Cantrell said. “You are not trying to catch a fish to eat.

Just as birders seek out rare species, microfishermen seek out rare fish. It’s a hobby that requires patience, a keen eye and a willingness to get wet.\nHansell’s first microfishing expedition was in 2016, when he joined a group of microfishermen on a trip to the Ozarks.

And now the tracks — Hazel Park Raceway, which holds thoroughbred races, and Northville Downs, which runs standardbred harness races — find themselves on opposite sides of proposed legislation that initially attempted to resolve the issue.\nExecutives at Northville Downs say the bill as written is a nonstarter, even after a controversial provision that would have allowed some Internet-based wagering at the tracks was stripped from the bill on the Senate floor.\nIn response, Hazel Park Raceway and its affiliated horsemen's group, the Howell-based Michigan Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, say they intend to ask the Michigan Gaming Control Board to pursue online wagering as an administrative rule change, rather than in statute.\nThe practice, known as advance deposit wagering, would allow people to place bets on simulcast races from their cellphones or tablets without having to visit a track. Current law requires anyone betting on horse racing to do so from within a track.\nHazel Park and Northville Downs consider online betting on horse races an extension of what they already do, replacing paper with the mobile devices that people carry everywhere. The Michigan Lottery has introduced online games, which track owners believe is essentially the same thing.\nAnd because more than 95 percent of the tracks' wagering revenue comes from people who place bets on simulcast races, rather than live ones, the interest in electronic wagering is also financial. The tracks say they're competing for business against out-of-state mobile wagering sites that don't pay state taxes and don't offer a cut of the proceeds to support either track and their affiliated horse owners' group.\nEarlier versions of Senate Bill 504, sponsored by state Sen. David Robertson, included a provision that would have allowed the horse track with the larger handle during the past five years to operate advance deposit wagering.\nBy numbers alone, Hazel Park had the larger simulcast handle — $56.6 million in 2015, compared to $45 million for Northville Downs, according to Michigan Gaming Control Board figures.\n\"I would have had to take everybody to court,\" said Mike Carlo, Northville Downs' operations manager. \"That was the biggest slap in the face I've ever seen in this industry.\n\"In our world, we live under the purview of our license,\" he added. \"Basically, what it would have done is it would have said that Hazel Park has a different license to operate pari-mutuel wagering in a manner that Northville Downs can't.\"\nThe bill that passed the Senate does not include that language. Instead, it would allow Michigan's racing commissioner to draft administrative rules to govern the practice.\nThe Michigan Gaming Control Board, which regulates the horse industry along with Detroit's three commercial casinos, opposed the earlier version of the bill. Robertson, R-Grand Blanc Township, said the board and harness racing groups wanted the language removed.\nA 2004 amendment to the Michigan Constitution requires a statewide vote for any expansion of gaming. The board has not yet publicly said whether it would consider authorizing advance deposit wagering.\nRobertson, track owners and horsemen's groups all say they don't believe the practice would violate the constitutional provision.\n\"The (board) will have to see what the options and its authority are if the bill becomes law,\" gaming board spokeswoman Mary Kay Bean said via email.\nThe bill could get a hearing in the House agriculture committee this week after clearing the Senate last week in a 30-7 vote.\nThe bill would alter how purses are distributed between the state's two remaining tracks: Hazel Park Raceway and Northville Downs (pictured).\nRobertson's bill would be the first update to Michigan's 1995 horse racing statute. Among other things, it would rewrite the formula that distributes revenue from wagers.\nCurrently, all wagers placed on simulcast races at Hazel Park and Northville Downs are pooled into a common purse, where it's split between the tracks and horsemen's groups. Track owners say that setup made more sense years ago, when Michigan had more horse tracks in operation.\nBut waning interest in horse racing led to the closure of seven tracks since 1998, leaving just two tracks. Hazel Park and Northville Downs essentially compete for the same audience, despite the fact that they don't race the same breeds of horses, and have lost money as the wagering pool decreased. Thus, competition for market share has become increasingly important.\nToday, the common purse is divided in a way that offers roughly 65 percent of the proceeds to the harness racing standardbreds, after winners and a 3.5 percent state tax are paid, with the rest going to the thoroughbreds.\nRobertson's bill would eliminate the common purse in favor of a \"site-specific\" model, meaning all of the wagers placed at Northville Downs and Hazel Park would stay at the respective tracks.\n\"Horse racing has had very tough times. It's been diminishing as a sport, and this is an attempt to try to amend the law in a way that will help all of racing,\" Robertson said. \"This language is archaic.\"\nNorthville Downs agreed to the funding formula change, which ultimately is a concession that would award them a smaller share of the simulcast purse pool than they receive now.\nBut Carlo and the Michigan Harness Horsemen's Association say the change triggers a problem with a different section of the bill, which they believe would require Hazel Park's owners to sign off each time Northville Downs wanted to simulcast a thoroughbred horse race.\nTheir fear is that Hazel Park and thoroughbred groups could block Northville Downs from simulcasting the Kentucky Derby, for instance, since the money collected under the new model would not be shared with Hazel Park and thoroughbred owners.\n\"Since the dawn of simulcasting, all tracks have taken all breeds,\" said Tom Barrett, president of the harness horsemen's group. \"We are only going to support a bill that treats both tracks the same.\"\nGeorge Kutlenios, president of the thoroughbred horsemen's association, said his group doesn't intend to prevent Northville Downs from showing thoroughbred races.\n\"I don't know why we would not want to send a signal,\" Kutlenios said. \"The more signals, the more product you have to offer. I can't even envision a scenario where that makes sense.\"\nThe fight over simulcast revenue in some ways explains the desire for advance deposit wagering.\nSimulcast wagers contributed $3.6 million in state tax revenue last year, a drop of 9 percent from 2014, according to the gaming control board. And the roughly $106 million wagered on live and simulcast races last year is well below the $261 million bet in 2007.\nKutlenios said he has heard some industry estimates peg the amount wagered illegally in Michigan through services in other states at between $90 million and $120 million.\nRobertson also sponsored Senate Bill 505, which would make it a felony to accept wagers on live or simulcast horse races in Michigan without a license. That bill also moved to the House.\nProponents say they want to stop",

Sometimes, its graphics don’t fit on the screen. If you decide to play skeeball, good luck figuring out how to aim. If you throw the ball, you can’t even see where it lands.\nWho makes a game like this? The credits trace the game back to Thornbury Software, the founder of which is Robert Thornbury, a 59-year-old former factory worker in Winchester, Indiana who says he used to work 22-hour days between the factory and making games. A Day At The Carnival is what it is, he argues, because it is for kids.\nBy earning enough points in the games, you can win teddy bears.\nIt’s not inherently clear why targeting games to children would excuse some of the problems in A Day At The Carnival, but Robert Thornbury is clear that he’s probably not making games for me or you.

Thornbury says he thinks they won’t change it either because they like the controversy, or maybe because they are busy.\nIn this minigame, you walk through a tunnel that shakes, rattles, and rolls.\nSome makers of bad games come off as greedy charlatans trying to make a quick buck, others like dreamers who can’t turn their ambitions into compelling reality. Thornbury seems different. When we spoke, he sounded earnest but overwhelmed, remarking that his company can’t compete with giants like Naughty Dog and Microsoft. His creations aren’t innovative, but focus on the desire to serve up some nostalgic pleasures by making games about archery and carnivals. When he talks about the games he has made or hopes to make, he sounds like a man who got the passion to program long ago, but has had little time to get the training to meet modern expectations. You can see it in the screenshots on Thornbury Software’s website or in A Day At The Carnival as it runs sluggishly on the Wii U: these are games that look like they were built for Windows 95.\nThornbury is unsure about exactly when he first learned to make games. But he says he remembers that that back when he was in school, he had to create a tic tac toe game, a chess game, and a checkers game. Thornbury says he developed his programming skills decades ago by working with DOS, and later with Windows. He launched Thornbury Software in 1992 after he wanted to market a checkers game that he wrote.\nThese days, he programs the games, while his business partner, Tannis Stants, does the artwork and animation. The company’s first major game was 2016’s The Call of the West, which is available as a PC game. It’s about a girl named Abby who decides to explore the Wild West. The next three games, A Day at the Carnival, Archery, and Shooting Range were designed to be “quick and dirty games” to be played on the now-defunct Playstation Mobile.\nIn this skeeball game, you’ll notice that the graphics are offscreen and that it’s relatively easy to win a teddy bear. However, you can’t see where the ball lands.\nUntil recently, he wasn’t primarily a game developer. Over the years, he’s had to work factory jobs to make ends meet. He assembled locks for Honda hoods at a Marujun plant. Last year, after Marujun was bought out, he began working at a TOA factory, where he welded Subaru frames together.

Imagine if the full weight of the federal government’s ponderous and powerful law enforcement, judiciary, and intelligence communities put their sights squarely on them, joined by ignorant and eager fellow travelers from media and the entertainment industry.\nConstantly and gleefully they attack that person and tear apart the lives of their friends, family, and business associates, ripping apart life after life on an expedition rivaling that of Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in expense, effort, and likelihood of finding the intended result.\nEven better, imagine if it were you.\nRepublicans celebrating victory after the exoneration of the president have even forgotten the true tragedy of what has happened to President Donald J. Trump. Too many treated this like a game won and have forgotten that the president and all those around him have paid a steep price for the entire time that this investigation has taken place.\nSo, just for a minute, imagine that Donald Trump does not have billions of dollars. Imagine that he is not the president of the United States. Forget that he has an abrasive style that might or might not rub you the wrong way. Imagine that he is another child of God, like you and me. Then put yourself in this human being’s shoes.\nIf this were you, how would you process it? Armchair pundits on either side sugarcoat it, saying “if you are innocent, you have nothing to worry about.” That wipes away the very real human response to a continual Sword of Damocles hanging over your head. We know that in many cases, such as that of Conrad Black, when prosecutors want your head they can and will manipulate the law and facts to serve you up like a spiral ham on Easter to a waiting jury. An investigatory group that spent two years and over $20 million has every incentive to comb through every detail to find something, anything, to justify what was spent.\nIn reality, no human being could endure this easily. You see the collateral damage done to friends and associates, their lives and reputations ruined to no good end. You fear for those friends and family that you love and care about, wondering who might be next sacrificed to the frivolous whim of investigators, politicians, and the media.\nThe insider jackals that pursued Donald Trump from even before the time where his presidential campaign showed signs of actual vitality used every measure at their disposal to destroy the man publicly, privately, and legally.\nIronically, the same liberals who argued against the expanded intelligence capabilities post 9/11 proved themselves right and George W. Bush supporters wrong by using the very same controversial tools to harass and destroy innocent American citizens for political motives. These included the use of secret courts and chummy back passage relationships at the highest levels. In doing so they resurrected the spirit and some of the methods of the Okhrana right here in the United States of America against its own duly elected head of state.\nOur greatest legal thinkers and jurists feared just this kind of persecution of any individual American citizen. They urged caution and restraint. John Marshall, in his opinion on United States v. Burr (1807) had to weigh the case of an infamous character. Aaron Burr infuriated his own Democratic-Republican Party by trying to steal the presidency from Thomas Jefferson. He then sealed his political fate by killing Federalist Alexander Hamilton in a duel. After authorities stopped Burr’s fruitless expedition to conquer Spanish territory, a vengeful President Jefferson declared him a traitor against the United States without a modicum of evidence.\nJohn Marshall, with every reason to despise Burr personally, penned in his opinion “if any conduct on the part of the court could warrant a sentiment that it would deviate to the one side or the other from the line prescribed by duty and by law, that conduct would be viewed by the judges themselves with an eye of extreme severity, and would long be recollected with deep and serious regret.” He and others of the Founding Father generation feared that political and social passions could pervert government and justice and sought to restrain, rather than expand, certain powers.\nChief Justice Earl Warren served during a time when presidential power expanded tremendously.

        "prompt": "Tough love from the Congressional Oversight Panel involves ripping the Band-Aid--otherwise known as TARP--off the mortally wounded banking system.\nWarren is one of a very small circle of experts who, during the boom years, accurately diagnosed the frailty of American finance capitalism. In scholarly articles, blog posts and several widely praised books, she has focused on the ways post-1970s wage stagnation has squeezed the middle class, leading to a drop in savings, a massive spike in consumer debt and more hours of labor spent to purchase core middle-class goods like healthcare and housing. The cumulative effect of these changes, as she argued in her talk at Berkeley, is families taking on far more risk than those of a generation earlier, and an economy skating on very thin ice.\nFast-forward eighteen months to the frenzied, panicked week in September after the fall of Lehman Brothers, when Henry Paulson sent his original three-page TARP proposal to Congress with the notoriously tone-deaf provision that Treasury’s decisions would be “non-reviewable…by any court of law or any administrative agency.” The provision was nearly unanimously panned, and the final Emergency Economic Stabilization Act stipulated several oversight mechanisms, including the creation of a five-member Congressional Oversight Panel. Appointed by leaders in Congress from both parties, the COP was given the task of reporting every thirty days on the program’s effectiveness, transparency and protection of taxpayers.\nOn top of that, the panel got a late start. By the time House minority leader John Boehner got around to appointing Representative Jeb Hensarling on November 19–giving the panel the requisite quorum–it had only eight days to produce its first report.\nAnd yet somehow the COP has managed to raise a considerable ruckus. Meeting at least once a week, the panel (which includes Warren, Hensarling, former Republican Senator John Sununu, AFL-CIO associate counsel Damon Silvers and Richard Neiman, superintendent of banks for the New York State banking department) has churned out four rigorous, detailed reports.\nIndeed, the report found that Treasury has already overpaid by a staggering $78 billion, or almost a third of the money it had spent at the time of the report. “They described a transaction to do one thing,” Warren says, “and it was designed from its inception to do something very different.” She doesn’t say what that “something” is, but it’s clear: subsidize the banks’ losses.\nSo what now? Charged with oversight, not with crafting policy, Warren is insistent on not offering substantive suggestions for",

But given that she’s a bankruptcy law professor, I pressed her on the policy options on the table and asked her to describe what a version of bankruptcy for some of the troubled banks might look like.\nThis is more or less what the FDIC has been doing, largely under the media radar, with numerous small, failed banks at an alarming rate of about two a week for the past few months. Of course, that would mean facing up to massive losses in wealth for equity holders of the banks that go under. Those folks tend to have some muscle in Washington, and their hope is essentially to get the government to take the losses for them. Worrisomely, their interests seem to have been taken to heart by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President Obama’s top economic adviser, Larry Summers, who appear to be doing their damnedest to avoid any resolution of the crisis that involves banks owning up to their losses.",

We have to be very clear about what our strategy is. And we have to be very clear about what our plan is.” In other words, we must get back to the original goal of helping homeowners stay in their homes.\nI ask Warren if she thinks that the political will exists to pull off such an ambitious plan. “Do I have any idea what it will take to move the political will?” she says with a laugh. “Oh, yeah. I have a very good idea.” She goes on to describe the process of building a consensus around the idea",

X amount of money is spent, and X amount of money is gone. Very little of the $700 billion has been spent, but the money is already gone.\nThe only way to get more money into the system is to sell more bonds. Keep in mind that the government is already borrowing money to pay for the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the war on drugs, the war on terror, the war on poverty, the war on cancer, the war on AIDS, the war on hunger, the war on obesity, the war on global warming, the war on the deficit, the war on the debt, the war on the national debt",

Knowing that she’s a little more likely to get her way in a Democratic administration than a Republican one, her advice to Barack Obama is to “be very, very tough” with Wall Street.

So far Warren has been a sharp critic of the Obama administration in her public remarks, and she remains one in her private conversations. For a movement desperately seeking strong voices to articulate a clear vision for the future, Elizabeth Warren is one step closer.\nNow, sitting back with a sigh in her office, her eyes still weary with work but still bright with fight, is not a time for the kind of grandiose rhetoric she’s famous for.

This is an initial rendering of the project, which may change designs as it makes its way through City Hall and the Design Review Board.\nWith a unanimous vote, the City Council, in its dual role as the Housing Authority, agreed to partner with an affordable housing developer on Tuesday to build a roughly $15.5-million project that will give preference to veterans.\n“It's a great day for Glendale,” said Mayor Frank Quintero, a Vietnam War veteran.\nThe site at 327-331 W. Salem St. was set to become Central City Lights, a 36-unit project by Advanced Development and Investment, Inc. But that project was canceled, and last April the city sued ADI, alleging the Los Angeles developer bilked the city of millions of dollars.\nADI had requested about $6.9 million in redevelopment and federal funding for its $15.7-million project that was to include artist live-work lofts, according to a city report.\nPATH Ventures, another Los Angeles developer, pitched a similarly sized project several months ago for the site, but city officials turned down their offer, saying they wanted more control over the property.\nInstead, the City Council approved partnering with Thomas Safran & Associates for Veterans Village on four adjoining lots comprising 27,910 square feet. The low-income, multifamily housing project will include 44 units.\nEach unit is set to range in size from about 600 to 1,100 square feet, include one-, two- and three-bedroom units and cost between $474 and $1,315 per month. The complex may also include a community room, library lounge, fitness room, computer labs and other amenities.\nDepending on the number of people in their household, future Veterans Village residents must make between $17,730 and $58,680 a year.\nThomas Safran & Associates also developed Garfield Gardens, a 30-unit complex, in 2010 at 305 E. Garfield St. Councilwoman Laura Friedman described that project as one of the best affordable housing developments in the city.\nThe preliminary project design, which still must be reviewed by city officials and the Design Review Board, includes an arts-and-crafts-style traditional design, a partial stone façade, balconies and a central clock tower.\nThe city's part of the deal will include $5.3 million in cash and land, according to a city report. Much of the city funding comes from federal grants. The developer plans to also apply for about $8 million in federal tax credits that can be sold to profitable organizations or individuals in exchange for project financing.\nAndrew Gross, principal at Thomas Safran & Associates, said the developer may be awarded the tax credits next July. Once that happens, the developer may begin construction in September. The project may be complete in early 2015",

Community Development Partners also plans to apply for $2.4 million in tax credits to cover development costs.\nThe monthly rent will range from $448 to $961 for studios and one bedrooms and applicants must have a similar income range, depending on family size, as Veterans Village.\nThe Cypress project may be complete in about 12 months, with construction possibly beginning next March, city officials said.\nThe city is not accepting applications for both projects.

        "prompt": "If you spend your days amid ancient clay tablets with one of the earliest forms of written language, the thought might occur to you: Wouldn’t it be fun to bake your own tablets out of gingerbread for the office holiday party?\nIt did to Katy Blanchard, 38, who is in charge of the Near Eastern collections at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The museum has one of the world’s largest collections of cuneiform tablets from early Mesopotamia, many of them written by ancient scribes who used a reed stylus to etch pictograms into clay.\n“It really struck the world in just the right nerdy place,” said Ms. Blanchard, noting that a number of people, including home schooling parents, classroom teachers and scholars of ancient languages, had taken the idea and run with it.\nCuneiform, which is pronounced “cune-AY-uh-form” and means wedge-shaped writing, was devised by the Sumerians more than 5,000 years ago and survived until about 79 or 80 A.D. It emerged at roughly the same time as early Egyptian writing, and served as the written form of ancient tongues like Akkadian and Sumerian, which thrived in what is now southern Iraq. Because cuneiform was written in clay (rather than, say, on papyrus) and important texts were baked for posterity, a good amount of it survives today.\nSchoolchildren who visit the Penn Museum get to try their hand. “The deepest part of every symbol is the upper left, because that’s where you start with your reed, and then you just swirl it around,” Ms. Blanchard said.\nAncient schoolchildren did the same thing, and some of their efforts are on view at the museum, written on hand-held practice tablets. “There’s like a first-day tablet, where you can see someone practice the first wedge over and over and over again, like I practiced an ‘A’ in school,” Ms. Blanchard said.\nMs. Blanchard’s title at the museum is “keeper,” which involves caring for the artifacts in the Near Eastern collections and helping visiting researchers and scholars find the right items to advance their work. “It’s a combination of putting small things in boxes and knowing where jars of dirt came from,” as she put it once in an interview. The cuneiform tablets are in the Babylonian collection, which is not in her purview, but they inspired her nonetheless.\nIt was a holiday party several years ago that prompted Ms. Blanchard to contemplate the similarities between clay tablets and cookie dough. She has been making cuneiform cookies annually ever since, usually for the same holiday party. “Last year, I tried to make a brownie ziggurat,” modeled on an ancient temple, “but it did not go over as well,” she said.\nAlthough Ms. Blanchard surmises that shortbread might also be a good medium for cuneiform, it was the gingerbread that went viral, inspiring copycats online.\nInspired by Ms. Blanchard’s cuneiform cookies, Esther Brownsmith, a Ph.D. student in the Bible and Near East program at Brandeis University who has been studying Akkadian for years, went all out: For a New Year’s party, she baked four tablets of gingerbread, each on a 13-by-18-inch pan, and copied part of the Enuma Elish, a seven-tablet Babylonian creation myth, onto them. A stunning step-by-step description of this feat has drawn thousands of “likes” on her Tumblr blog.\nMs. Brownsmith said a friend emailed her a link to",

(The other is the Code of Hammurabi.) Gilgamesh was a mighty king from the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, the name of which is thought to have morphed into Iraq.

Vanilla extract, for example, was not available in ancient Mesopotamia, so she used almond extract instead. Quoting the Enuma Elish in Akkadian, she wrote the text in cuneiform on the cookies, and then baked them.\nMs. Unger, who is a Ph.D. Fellow in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University, said she was “flattered” that her cookies had inspired others to make their own.

However, investors need to be aware of the avenue of direct exposure in bonds, for the sake of wider choice.\nThe biggest drawback of the direct bond route is lack of liquidity in the secondary market. This problem is, however, not there in one segment of the bond market: Tax-free PSU bonds. These bonds are rated top notch, i.e., AAA, and have implicit government support.\nThe interest payments on these bonds are free of tax, but there would be capital gains tax if you sell before maturity at a profit. The method for dealing in these bonds is similar to that of dealing in equity shares: You have to have the basic set-up with your stock broker. These bonds are listed in the capital market segment of exchanges, and hence can be dealt with in a manner similar to that of equity stocks.\nReturns on these bonds are attractive, even at current levels after a rally and yields having come down from higher levels earlier. In market parlance, the yield is referred to as YTM, which stands for yield to maturity. In simple terms, the yield is the return you would get, if you hold the bond till maturity, expressed as compound annualised interest rate. The YTM on tax-free PSU bonds currently is around 6.1%.\nThe proper perspective to look at the yield on tax-free bonds is the ‘pre-tax equivalent’ and compare it with a taxable instrument, though technically it is tax-free. Taking the tax-free bond yield at say 6.1% and the tax rate at 30.9%, the pre-tax equivalent comes to 6.1% / (1-30.9%) = 8.83%. The yields available in the market for taxable AAA rated PSU bonds is much lower than 8.83%, hence it makes sense to buy these bonds.\nThe other option is taxable PSU bonds / private sector bonds / bonds rated AAA or lower.

        "prompt": "Get the scoop on how these funds have gained ground.\nIt's been a tough year for international investors so far in 2018. Few countries have managed to match the returns of the S&P 500 in the U.S., due to a combination of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, along with a strong U.S. dollar against many major foreign currencies. For investors in exchange-traded funds, finding single-country ETFs with positive returns has been a challenge.\nHowever, there are a few countries that have managed to thrive even in a difficult environment. Let's take a closer look at iShares MSCI Israel (NYSEMKT:EIS), Global X MSCI Norway (NYSEMKT:NORW), and iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (NYSEMKT:KSA), which are the best performers so far this year among single-country ETFs with more than $100 million in assets under management.\nData source: ETFdb.com. As of Sept. 18.\nWhat's notable about this list of three single-country ETFs is that two of the most important economies in the Middle East are represented. The Israel ETF tops the list, and although a 13% gain might not seem like much, it's impressive in the current environment.\nThe iShares ETF shows the breadth of Israel's economy. Two companies that are well-known to U.S. investors, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Check Point Software Technologies, dominate the fund, combining to make up almost 30% of the ETF's assets. But you'll also find some high-flying smaller technology players, along with exposure to Israel financial institutions and a host of other sectors. With the tech boom lifting stocks across the globe, Israel has benefited greatly from its outsized exposure to the industry.\nFarther south, the Saudi Arabia ETF is even more surprising to investors because of its almost complete lack of direct exposure to the energy sector. Most of the kingdom's energy enterprises are state-owned and unavailable to investors. Instead, three-quarters of the fund's assets are invested in financials and materials stocks, with powerhouses Saudi Basic Industries and Al Rajhi Bank having 16% and 12% allocations within the ETF, respectively. Obviously, banking institutions have substantial indirect exposure to energy, but Saudi Arabia has also worked hard to try to diversify its economic exposure and find ways to plan for a future in which its vast oil resources will be depleted.\nFar from the warm waters of the Mediterranean and Red Seas, Norway has also managed to buck the trend toward poor-performing stock markets in 2018. The nation is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas resources",

Yet even though Norway's energy stocks have done well this year, some of its most impressive performers have been in the consumer area, especially among seafood producers.\nLike Saudi Arabia, Norway is working to evolve beyond its fossil fuel dependence, and energy giant Statoil recently changed its name to Equinor to de-emphasize its oil origins. The company has built massive offshore wind farms as part of its push toward renewable energy, and with energy-hungry consumers both domestically and across Europe, Equinor could help lead Norway and the Global X ETF's returns higher for the foreseeable future.\nWhat's next for these ETFs?\nEven with solid gains so far in 2018, these ETFs have plenty of promise left for the future. Israel's technology emphasis arguably gives it the best prospects for gains, but renewable energy could also be a pioneering influence for Saudi Arabia and Norway as well.",

The fund's top three stocks by holding are all in the consumer discretionary space, with oil and gas giant Statoil taking the top spot with a 12% holding. The fund also has a 10% holding in beverage giant Orkla, which is a move away from the energy focus that many of its peers have in an effort to diversify away from the energy sector.\nThe best-performing single-country ETFs in 2018 have put to use the lessons learned from the past.

If no plan is found worthy of acceptance, the assets shall go into liquidation, it ruled.\nThe court noticed that both ArcelorMittal and Numetal were technically ineligible to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, because of their links to entities that had defaulted on payments.\nBut a bench of Justices RF Nariman and Indu Malhotra invoked its extraordinary powers to give them two weeks to pay up the dues and resubmit bids.\nSection 29A of the code bars promoters of defaulting companies or related parties, and connected people from bidding for stressed assets unless they have paid their dues.\nArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, was a promoter of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, which together owed Rs 7,000 crore to banks in India and defaulted on payments. Numetal, led by Russia’s VTB Bank, had a member of Essar Steel’s promoter family, Rewant Ruia, as an investor when it made an initial bid. Essar Steel has outstanding debt of more than Rs 37,000 crore.\nArcelorMittal said it had exited the defaulting companies, claiming that this allowed it to make an offer. Nevertheless, it offered to pay off the dues if it was allowed to bid. Numetal argued that it was an independent entity with no ties to Essar Steel promoters, and therefore the Ruia family’s liabilities couldn’t be fastened on it.\nThe court refused to accept the arguments. “We… hold that, whether the first or second resolution plan is taken into account, both would clearly be hit by Section 29A(c), as the looming presence of Rewant Ruia has been found all along, from the date of incorporation of Numetal till the date of submission of the second resolution plan,” the bench said.\n“It is absolutely clear that LN Mittal, who is the ultimate shareholder of the resolution applicant, viz. AMIPL (ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd), is directly the ultimate shareholder of AMNLBV (ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV, which had invested in Uttam Galva and KSS Petron) as well, which is an LN Mittal Group company.

But hours of crunches won't give you the stomach you desire; it just builds the muscle under the flab. The best, surest, fastest, most effective and honest way to a flat belly for men includes a combination of aerobic exercise, core strengthening, a healthy diet and overall strength training.\nTo get a flat stomach you need to lose the flab, and that means aerobic exercise to burn it off. At a minimum, you need 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity five days a week but should shoot for closer to 60 minutes to lose the weight and flatten the stomach. Of course, if you up the intensity you can cut your workout time in half. Take a brisk walk, go for a run or do laps in the pool, whatever exercise you enjoy that gets your heart rate pumping.\nWhen you want a flat stomach, you need to think about your entire midsection, which includes not only your ab muscles but also your lower back and pelvic muscles. This area of your body is referred to as the core. You may consider it just for women, but if you want to work out your core and improve the look of your abs, sign up for Pilates. Pilates works to strengthen and lengthen all the muscles in your midsection. You can also work out your core with various floor exercises such as the reverse or bicycle crunch, the plank -- both front and side -- and pelvic tilts.\nThe ab diet isn't any different from any other diet that helps you lose weight.

And it's a rapidly evolving space with literally dozens of well-known hotels undergoing overhauls in the past five years.\nAnd although the white, bright and light rooms from globally renowned designer, Kelly Hoppen, have often been the talking point, it is now the creative liberty of the brand which is stealing more of the limelight.\nIts CEO, Paul Jones, formerly of One&Only is fixated on the element of surprise and innovation at memorable touch-points in the resort - the reason why I found my sunglasses resting on a square cleaning cloth in my room, my name sewn into my gown, a happy birthday pillow on the bed for my wife with a small bag of gifts, or even a towel wrapped in the shape of a cake with rose petals as decoration.\nYes, absolutely, LUX* Belle Mare's heated pool (at 2,000 square metres) is the largest on the island, and the beach is arguably the best (according to the locals). The guys at the boathouse were patient and humorous and instructed my daughter with real care to get her on waterskis, but that's a standard that LUX* seems to expect as a foundation, a canvas to work from.\nThe colours that make a splash are things like the Mari Kontan thatched rum bar, their own craft microbrewery, the K-Bar next to the pool, or its own coffee shop, Cafe LUX*, which roasts its own beans and allows guests to participate in a roastery tour at the resort. A stone's throw away, there is the tiny Tea",

It was Junk Art which caught our attention next door, an art studio devoted to arts and crafts - but only using recycled materials - so the kids made cardboard cameras, musical instruments, and even a fidget spinner. The only issue with Junk Art was trying to get the kids out of there - they stayed two and a half hours one afternoon.",

Council members lacked consensus on the measure. The council typically takes positions on statewide issues only if there is unanimity.\n\"This is a discussion of competing values,\" council member Ross Cunniff said. \"I think it's up to the voters to decide how they want to weigh in on this one.\"\nThe council's legislative review committee recommended formal opposition to the measure. The full council's vote is just a show of support, neutrality or opposition to statewide measures.\nCompeting rallies gathered in front of City Hall before the meeting, with a pro-112 group at the main entry. Anti-112 activists grouped together along Laporte Avenue and the parking lot. But once inside the council chambers, the public commenting was decidedly pro-112, with about 22 people supporting the half-mile setbacks and about seven opposing them.\n\"I think it would have been better if (council members) all wanted to support 112,\" but abstention also works, Kevin Cross of the Fort Collins Sustainability Group said after the vote. He was dismissive about the negative effects of the setbacks. Horizontal drilling is economically viable from greater than 2,500 feet and the industry's employment base in the state is overstated, he argued.\nCouncil member Ken Summers most vocally opposed the measure from the council and warned a downturn would hurt Fort Collins by way of its neighbors in Weld County, one of the heaviest oil-and-gas-producing counties in the country.\n\"We don't put fences around Weld County to keep all the oil and gas workers in Weld County and keep them out of Fort Collins,\" he said, noting many Fort Collins residents and people who come to the Choice City for fun work in the industry.\nHe added, \"The oil and gas industry is not some monolithic evil empire. It's a lot of small businesses that are endeavoring to work and raise families and just to do what every American desires to do in terms of enjoying a quality of life, having an income and a job.\"\nThe City Council in August approved a setback for new developments that prevented them from being built within 500 feet of an existing oil and gas well, which is extended to 1,000 feet for high-occupancy buildings.

        "prompt": "Revelations from WikiLeaks published this week show how boundlessly and comprehensively American intelligence services spied on the German government. It has now emerged that the US also conducted surveillance against SPIEGEL.\nDER SPIEGEL's headquarters in Hamburg, Germany: The newsmagazine filed a complaint Friday with the country's federal prosecutor after discovering it had been US spying target.\nWalks during working hours aren't the kind of pastime one would normally expect from a leading official in the German Chancellery. Especially not from the head of Department Six, the official inside Angela Merkel's office responsible for coordinating Germany's intelligence services.\nBut in the summer of 2011, Günter Heiss found himself stretching his legs for professional reasons. The CIA's station chief in Berlin had requested a private conversation with Heiss. And he didn't want to meet in an office or follow standard protocol. Instead, he opted for the kind of clandestine meeting you might see in a spy film.\nOfficially, the CIA man was accredited as a counsellor with the US Embassy, located next to Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate. Married to a European, he had already been stationed in Germany once before and knew how to communicate with German officials. At times he could be demanding and overbearing, but he could also be polite and courteous. During this summer walk he also had something tangible to offer Heiss.\nThe CIA staffer revealed that a high-ranking Chancellery official allegedly maintained close contacts with the media and was sharing official information with reporters with SPIEGEL.\nThe American provided the name of the staffer: Hans Josef Vorbeck, Heiss' deputy in Department Six. The information must have made it clear to Heiss that the US was spying on the German government as well as the press that reports on it.\nThe central Berlin stroll remained a secret for almost four years. The Chancellery quietly transferred Vorbeck, who had until then been responsible for counterterrorism, to another, less important department responsible dealing with the history of the BND federal intelligence agency. Other than that, though, it did nothing.\nOfficials in the Chancellery weren't interested in how the CIA had obtained its alleged information. They didn't care to find out how, and to which degree, they were being spied on by the United States. Nor were they interested in learning about the degree to which SPIEGEL was being snooped on by the Americans. Chancellery officials didn't contact any of the people in question. They didn't contact members of the Bundestag federal parliament sitting on the Parliamentary Control Panel, the group responsible for oversight of the intelligence services. They didn't inform members of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the agency responsible for counterintelligence in Germany, either. And they didn't contact a single public prosecutor. Angela Merkel's office, it turns out, simply made a farce of the rule of law.\nAs a target of the surveillance, SPIEGEL has requested more information from the Chancellery. At the same time, the magazine filed a complaint on Friday with the Federal Public Prosecutor due to suspicion of intelligence agency activity.\nBecause now, in the course of the proceedings of the parliamentary investigative committee probing the NSA's activities in Germany in the wake of revelations leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, details about the event that took place in the summer of 2011 are gradually leaking to the public. At the beginning of May, the mass-circulation tabloid Bild am Sonntag reported on a Chancellery official who had been sidelined \"in the wake of evidence of alleged betrayal of secrets through US secret services.\"\nResearch conducted by SPIEGEL has determined the existence of CIA and NSA files filled with a large number of memos pertaining to the work of the German newsmagazine. And three different government sources in Berlin and Washington have independently confirmed that the CIA station chief in Berlin was referring specifically to Vorbeck's contacts with SPIEGEL.\nAn Operation Justified by Security Interests?\nObama administration sources with knowledge of the operation said that it was justified by American security interests. The sources said US intelligence services had determined the existence of intensive contacts between SPIEGEL reporters and the German government and decided to intervene because those communications were viewed as damaging to the United States' interests. The fact that the CIA and NSA were prepared to reveal an ongoing surveillance operation to the Chancellery underlines the importance they attached to the leaks, say sources in Washington. The NSA, the sources say, were aware that the German government would know from then on that the US was spying in Berlin.\nAs more details emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that representatives of the German government at best looked away as the Americans violated the law, and at worst supported them.\nJust last Thursday, Günter Heiss and his former supervisor, Merkel's former Chief of Staff Ronald Pofalla, were questioned by the parliamentary investigative committee and attempted to explain the egregious activity. Heiss confirmed that tips had been given, but claimed they hadn't been \"concrete enough\" for measures to be taken. When asked if he had been familiar with the issue, Pofalla answered, \"Of course.\" He said that anything else he provided had to be \"in context,\" at which point a representative of the Chancellery chimed in and pointed out that could only take place in a meeting behind closed doors.\nFormer Chancellery chief Ronald Pofalla during questioning before the parliamentary committee investigating the NSA affair in Berlin. \"Of course\" he had been familiar with the issue, the former senior Merkel staffer said.\nIn that sense, the meeting of the investigative committee once again shed light on the extent to which the balance of power has shifted between the government and the Fourth Estate. Journalists, who scrutinize and criticize those who govern, are an elementary part of the \"checks and balances\" -- an American invention -- aimed at ensuring both transparency and accountability. When it comes to intelligence issues, however, it appears this system has been out of balance for some time.\nWhen SPIEGEL first reported in Summer 2013 about the extent of NSA's spying on Germany, German politicians first expressed shock and then a certain amount of indignation before quickly sliding back into their persona as a loyal ally. After only a short time and a complete lack of willingness on the part of the Americans to explain their actions, Pofalla declared that the \"allegations are off the table.\"\nBut a number of reports published in recent months prove that, whether out of fear, outrage or an alleged lack of knowledge, it was all untrue. Everything the government said was a lie. As far back as 2013, the German government was in a position to suspect, if not to know outright, the obscene extent to which the United States was spying on an ally. If there hadn't already been sufficient evidence of the depth of the Americans' interest in what was happening in Berlin, Wednesday's revelations by WikiLeaks, in cooperation with Süddeutsche Zeitung, filled in the gaps.\nSPIEGEL's reporting has long been a thorn in the side of the US administration. In addition to its reporting on a number of other scandals, the magazine exposed the kidnapping of Murat Kurnaz, a man of Turkish origin raised in Bremen, Germany, and his rendition to Guantanamo. It exposed the story of Mohammed Haydar Zammar, who was taken to Syria, where he was tortured. The reports triggered the launch of a parliamentary investigative committee in Berlin to look also into the CIA's practices.\nWhen SPIEGEL reported extensively on the events surrounding the arrest of three Islamist terrorists in the so-called \"Sauerland cell\" in Germany, as well as the roles played by the CIA and the NSA in foiling the group, the US government complained several times about the magazine. In December 2007, US intelligence coordinator Mike McConnell personally raised the issue during a visit to Berlin. And when SPIEGEL reported during the summer of 2009, under the headline \"Codename Domino,\" that a group of al-Qaida supporters was believed to be heading for Europe, officials at the CIA seethed. The sourcing included a number of security agencies and even a piece of information supplied by the Americans. At the time, the station chief for Germany's BND intelligence service stationed in Washington was summoned to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\nThe situation escalated in August 2010 after SPIEGEL, together with WikiLeaks, the Guardian and the New York Times, began exposing classified US Army reports from Afghanistan. That was followed three months later with the publication of the Iraq war logs based on US Army reports. And in November of that year, WikiLeaks, SPIEGEL and several international media reported how the US government thinks internally about the rest of the world on the basis of classified State Department cables. Pentagon officials at the time declared that WikiLeaks had \"blood on its hands.\" The Justice Department opened an investigation and seized data from Twitter accounts, e-mail exchanges and personal data from activists connected with the whistleblowing platform. The government then set up a Task Force with the involvement of the CIA and NSA.\nNot even six months later, the CIA station chief requested to go on the walk in which he informed the intelligence coordinator about Vorbeck and harshly criticized SPIEGEL.\nNot long later, a small circle inside the Chancellery began discussing how the CIA may have got ahold of the information. Essentially, two possibilities were conceivable: either through an informant or through surveillance of communications. But how likely is it that the CIA had managed to recruit a source in the Chancellery or on the editorial staff of SPIEGEL?\nThe more likely answer, members of the circle concluded, was that the information must have been the product of \"SigInt,\" signals intelligence -- in other words, wiretapped communications. It seems fitting that during the summer of 2013, just prior to the scandal surrounding Edward Snowden and the documents he exposed pertaining to NSA spying, German government employees warned several SPIEGEL journalists that the Americans were eavesdropping on them.\nAt the end of June 2011, Heiss then flew to Washington. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, the issue of the alleged contact with SPIEGEL was raised again. Chancellery staff noted the suspicion in a classified internal memo that explicitly names SPIEGEL.\nChancellor Merkel's former intelligence coordinator Günter Heiss has claimed that information provided by the CIA wasn't \"concrete\" enough for the German government to take action.\nOne of the great ironies of the story is that contact with the media was one of Vorbeck's job responsibilities. He often took part in background discussions with journalists and even represented the Chancellery at public events. \"I had contact with journalists and made no secret about it,\" Vorbeck told SPIEGEL. \"I even received them in my office in the Chancellery. That was a known fact.\" He has since hired a lawyer.\nIt remains unclear just who US intelligence originally had in its scopes. The question is also unlikely to be answered by the parliamentary investigative committee, because the US appears to have withheld this information from the Chancellery. Theoretically, at least, there are three possibilities: The Chancellery -- at least in the person of Hans Josef Vorbeck. SPIEGEL journalists. Or blanket surveillance of Berlin's entire government quarter. The NSA is capable of any of the three options. And it is important to note that each of these acts would represent a violation of German law.\nSo far, the Chancellery has barricaded itself behind the argument that the origin of the information had been too vague and abstract to act on. In addition, the tip had been given in confidentiality, meaning that neither Vorbeck nor SPIEGEL could be informed. But both are weak arguments, given that the CIA station chief's allegations were directed precisely at SPIEGEL and Vorbeck and that the intelligence coordinator's deputy would ultimately be sidelined as a result.\nAnd even if you follow the logic that the tip wasn't concrete enough, there is still one committee to whom the case should have been presented under German law: the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control Panel, whose proceedings are classified and which is responsible for oversight of Germany's intelligence services. The nine members of parliament on the panel are required to be informed about all intelligence events of \"considerable importance.\"\nMembers of parliament on the panel did indeed express considerable interest in the Vorbeck case. They learned in fall 2011 of his transfer, and wanted to know why \"a reliable coordinator in the fight against terrorism would be shifted to a post like that, one who had delivered excellent work on the issue,\" as then chairman of the panel, Social Demoratic Party politician Thomas Oppermann, criticized at the time.\nBut no word was mentioned about the reasons behind the transfer during a Nov. 9, 2011 meeting of the panel. Not a single word about the walk taken by the CIA chief of station. Not a word about the business trip to Washington taken by Günter Heiss afterward. And not a word about Vorbeck's alleged contacts with SPIEGEL. Instead, the parliamentarians were told a myth -- that the move had been made necessary by cutbacks. And also because he was needed to work on an historical appraisal of Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND.\nOfficials in the Chancellery had decided to deceive parliament about the issue. And for a long time, it looked as though they would get away with it.\nThe appropriate way of dealing with the CIA's incrimination would have been to transfer the case to the justice system. Public prosecutors would have been forced to follow up with two investigations: One to find out whether the CIA's allegations against Vorbeck had been true -- both to determine whether government secrets had been breached and out of the obligation to assist a longtime civil servant. It also would have had to probe suspicions that a foreign intelligence agency conducted espionage in the heart of the German capital.\nThat could, and should, have been the case. Instead, the Chancellery decided to go down the path of deception, scheming with an ally, all the while interpreting words like friendship and partnership in a highly arbitrary and scrupulous way.\nGünter Heiss, who received the tip from the CIA station chief, is an experienced civil servant. In his earlier years, Heiss studied music. He would go on as a music instructor to teach a young Ursula von der Leyen (who is Germany's defense minister today) how to play the piano. But then Heiss, a tall, slightly lanky man, switched professions and instead pursued a career in intelligence that would lead him to the top post in the Lower Saxony state branch of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Even back then, the Christian Democrat was already covering up the camera on his laptop screen with tape. At the very least \"they\" shouldn't be able to see him, he said at the time, elaborating that the \"they\" he was referring to should not be interpreted as being the US intelligence services, but rather the other spies - \"the Chinese\" and, \"in any case, the Russians.\" For conservatives like Heiss, America, after all, is friendly territory.\nIf there was suspicion in the summer of 2011 that the NSA was spying on a staff member at the Chancellery, it should have set off alarm bells within the German security apparatus. Both the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which is responsible for counter-intelligence, and the Federal Office for Information Security should have been informed so that they could intervene. There also should have been discussions between the government ministers and the chancellor in order to raise government awareness about the issue. And, going by the maxim the chancellor would formulate two years later, Merkel should have had a word with the Americans along the lines of \"Spying among friends is not acceptable.\"\nIf it is true that a foreign intelligence agency spied on journalists as they conducted their reporting in Germany and then informed the Chancellery about it, then these actions would place a huge question mark over the notion of a free press in this country. Germany's highest court ruled in 2007 that press freedom is a \"constituent part of a free and democratic order.\" The court held that reporting can no longer be considered free if it entails a risk that journalists will be spied on during their reporting and that the federal government will be informed of the people they speak to.\n\"Freedom of the press also offers protection from the intrusion of the state in the confidentiality of the editorial process as well as the relationship of confidentiality between the media and its informants,\" the court wrote in its ruling. Freedom of the press also provides special protection to the \"the secrecy of sources of information and the relationship of confidentiality between the press, including broadcasters, and the source.\"\nBut Karlsruhe isn't Washington. And freedom of the press is not a value that gives American intelligence agencies pause. On the contrary, the Obama administration has gained a reputation for adamantly pursuing uncomfortable journalistic sources. It hasn't even shied away from targeting American media giants.\nIn spring 2013, it became known that the US Department of Justice mandated the monitoring of 100 telephone numbers belonging to the news agency Associated Press. Based on the connections that had been tapped, AP was able to determine that the government likely was interested in determining the identity of an important informant. The source had revealed to AP reporters details of a CIA operation pertaining to an alleged plot to blow up a commercial jet.\nThe head of AP wasn't the only one who found the mass surveillance of his employees to be an \"unconstitutional act.\" Even Republican Senators like John Boehner sharply criticized the government, pointing to press freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. \"The First Amendment is first for a reason,\" he said.\nBut the Justice Department is unimpressed by such formulations. New York Times reporter James Risen, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, was threatened with imprisonment for contempt of court in an effort to get him to turn over his sources -- which he categorically refused to do for seven years. Ultimately, public pressure became too intense, leading Obama's long-time Attorney General Eric Holder to announce last October that Risen would not be forced to testify.\nThe Justice Department was even more aggressive in its pursuit of James Rosen, the Washington bureau chief for TV broadcaster Fox. In May 2013, it was revealed that his telephone was bugged, his emails were read and his visits to the State Department were monitored. To obtain the necessary warrants, the Justice Department had labeled Rosen a \"criminal co-conspirator.\"\nThe strategy of criminalizing journalism has become something of a bad habit under Obama's leadership, with his government pursuing non-traditional media, such as the whistleblower platform WikiLeaks, with particular aggression.\nBradley Manning, who supplied WikiLeaks with perhaps its most important data dump, was placed in solitary confinement and tormented with torture-like methods, as the United Nations noted critically. Manning is currently undergoing a gender transition and now calls herself Chelsea. In 2013, a military court sentenced Manning, who, among other things, publicized war crimes committed by the US in Iraq, to 35 years in prison.\nIn addition, a criminal investigation has been underway for at least the last five years into the platform's operators, first and foremost its founder Julian Assange. For the past several years, a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia has been working to determine if charges should be brought against the organization.\nThe proceedings are hidden from the public, but the grand jury's existence became apparent once it began to subpoena witnesses with connections to WikiLeaks and when the Justice Department sought to confiscate data belonging to people who worked with Assange. The US government, for example, demanded that Twitter hand over data pertaining to several people, including the Icelandic parliamentarian Brigitta Jonsdottir, who had worked with WikiLeaks on the production of a video. The short documentary is an exemplary piece of investigative journalism, showing how a group of civilians, including employees of the news agency Reuters, were shot and killed in Baghdad by an American Apache helicopter.\nComputer security expert Jacob Appelbaum, who occasionally freelances for SPIEGEL, was also affected at the time. Furthermore, just last week he received material from Google showing that the company too had been forced by the US government to hand over information about him - for the time period from November 2009 until today. The order would seem to indicate that investigators were particularly interested in Appelbaum's role in the publication of diplomatic dispatches by WikiLeaks.\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has referred to journalists who worked with material provided by Edward Snowden has his \"accomplices.\" In the US, there are efforts underway to pass a law pertaining to so-called \"media leaks.\" Australia already passed one last year. Pursuant to the law, anyone who reveals details about secret service operations may be punished, including journalists.\nThe German government isn't too far from such positions either. That has become clear with its handling of the strictly classified list of \"selectors,\" which is held in the Chancellery. The list includes search terms that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, used when monitoring telecommunications data on behalf of the NSA. The parliamentary investigative committee looking into NSA activity in Germany has thus far been denied access to the list. The Chancellery is concerned that allowing the committee to review the list could result in uncomfortable information making its way into the public.\nThe roof of the US Embassy in Berlin appears in the foreground, with the cupola of the German parliament building, the Reichstag, in the background. It is believed the US conducted esponiage from its Berlin Embassy.\nThat's something Berlin would like to prevent. Despite an unending series of indignities visited upon Germany by US intelligence agencies, the German government continues to believe that it has a \"special\" relationship with its partners in America -- and is apparently afraid of nothing so much as losing this partnership.\nThat, at least, seems to be the message of a five-page secret letter sent by Chancellery Chief of Staff Peter Altmaier, of Merkel's Christian Democrats, to various parliamentary bodies charged with oversight. In the June 17 missive, Altmaier warns of a \"grave loss of trust\" should German lawmakers be given access to the list of NSA spying targets. Opposition parliamentarians have interpreted the letter as a \"declaration of servility\" to the US.\nAltmaier refers in the letter to a declaration issued by the BND on April 30. It notes that the spying targets passed on by the NSA since 2005 include \"European political personalities, agencies in EU member states, especially ministries and EU institutions, and representations of certain companies.\" On the basis of this declaration, Altmaier writes, \"the investigative committee can undertake its own analysis, even without knowing the individual selectors.\"\nCommittee members have their doubts. They suspect that the BND already knew at the end of April what WikiLeaks has now released -- with its revelations that the German Economics Ministry, Finance Ministry and Agriculture Ministry were all under the gaze of the NSA, among other targets. That would mean that the formulation in the BND declaration of April 30 was intentionally misleading. The Left Party and the Greens now intend to gain direct access to the selector list by way of a complaint to Germany's Constitutional Court.\nThe government in Berlin would like to prevent exactly that. The fact that the US and German intelligence agencies shared selectors is \"not a matter of course. Rather, it is a procedure that requires, and indicates, a special degree of trust,\" Almaier writes. Should the government simply hand over the lists, Washington would see that as a \"profound violation of confidentiality requirements.\" One could expect, he writes, that the \"US side would significantly restrict its cooperation on security issues, because it would no longer see its German partners as sufficiently trustworthy.\"\nAltmaier's letter neglects to mention the myriad NSA violations committed against German interests, German citizens and German media.\n1. Do they also stop, or alter, Emails from readers?\nFor me, this is no surprise, the Spiegel brings a form of journalism which is too near to the truth for most nationalist governments. Although the (by name), Democratic party in the USA is more moderate and social, than the Republicans are, it is still handles in a way which could be compared with the most extreme radical national and religious governments around our globe. It would seem that America has accepted many ideas and methods. which in the last century were used by Stalin, Hitler, Benes and General Wadislaw Sikorski. Perhaps we should refer to these agencies as secret-, rather than intelligence services.\nNot Mrs. Merkel failed but the Greek state failed because one cannot spend more than one makes without going bankrupt.\nThe Merkel government and German banks' attempt at destroying Greece, and enacting a de facto anti-democratic coup",

Yet another reason for the NSA's fear of exposure in the German press.\nI have no illusions about the deeply corrupt American State. It is no longer a reflection of the American nation.

They had an unbelievable amount of people working out there; all kinds of friends and people from around other beaches.\"\n\"Everybody was pitching in to help them (residents) make it through the day,\" Watts said. \"It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just helps out.\"\nAccording to provincial Emergency Measures Organization officials, a total of seven permanent homes were literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes from Lake Dauphin around supper time on Friday, pushed by north winds gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour.\nDoug Davis had just taken a shower and was about to sit down on his couch and relax at his home along Ochre Beach on Friday night.\nThen he heard the ice coming.\n\"All of a sudden,\" said Davis’s wife, Elaine, \"that was it.\"\nWithin the next five minutes, a wall of ice rose from the lake so powerful that it plowed though the Davis’s two-storey home, pushing furniture from one bedroom into another. It pushed the bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.\nThe Davis family wasn’t alone. In all, 27 homes and cottages were damaged or destroyed – although no injuries were reported.\nA local state of emergency was declared in the municipality, and residents along the beach were evacuated on Friday night.\nThe provincial Emergency Social Services were called to the scene Friday night to assist residents in finding temporary lodging. Structural experts from the Office of the Fire Commissioner were also on hand to determine whether some residents could be allowed to attempt clean up or collect belongings. On Saturday, the residents and volunteers were allowed to return to the area and begin digging the ice on homes that were declared structurally stable.\nAll for a natural event that was over in just 15 minutes.\n\"They (homeowners) heard it before they saw it (the ice) coming up their decks,\" Watts said. \"Then it came right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt. We were very lucky.\"\nOn Saturday morning, Watts was standing on an adjacent beach, looking over the damage.\n\"The ice is up taller than the cottages and homes,\" he said. \"It kind of dwarfs them.\"\n\"This is nothing you can predict,\" Watts said. \"Water, you can see it coming up. There’s nothing you can do to prevent this. Sometimes, it’s just the luck of the way the wind is blowing. You can just hope for the best, and the best was no one got hurt.\"\nIce from Dauphin Lake smashed into this home at Ochre Beach Friday. About 23 homes were destroyed and 27 affected. No injuries were reported.\nHowever, Watts said many of the cottagers and home owners affected by the ice wave were also just recovering from severe flooding in 2011. In fact, a few of the homes were newly constructed.\n\"That’s what’s so devastating,\" he said. \"These people have rebuilt their homes and got their lives back together. Now they have to start over again.\"\nIn fact, the Davis’s were just in the process of seeking out contractors to rebuild the foundation of their home, due to lingering flood damage.\nInstead, on Saturday morning, Elaine was surveying an entirely different dilemma.\n\"We’re looking at a front room filled ice and we’re trying to shovel it out,\" she said. \"There are huge chunks.

        "prompt": "Waltrip's final race will be at Sonoma this June.\nIn his 19th season as a race analyst for Fox Sports, NASCAR Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip is set to end his broadcasting career at this June’s race at Sonoma, Fox’s final NASCAR race of the season.\nThere had been reports that the 72-year-old Waltrip was considering retirement, and that sparked a debate from those for and against the move, which spiraled out of control at times over the past few days.\nIn an exclusive conversation with Mike Organ of The Tennessean, Waltrip said he chose this Bristol race weekend as the right time and place to announce his retirement. Not only is Bristol Motor Speedway in Waltrip’s native Tennessee, it is the place where he had his biggest success, winning 12 races from 1978-92 (including seven in a row from 1981-84).\nWaltrip began his broadcasting career with Fox right after retiring as a driver. As one of the original on-air people from Fox’s first year in NASCAR, his career began in difficult fashion, calling his brother Michael (now a Fox NASCAR analyst) to his first career victory in the 2001 Daytona 500, which is more remembered for Dale Earnhardt’s fatal crash.\nEarly on, Waltrip’s reputation as an outspoken figure on the grid made him a perfect race analyst. Over the years, he combined that with a more light-hearted style, culminating with his traditional “Boogity, boogity, boogity” catchphrase before each race, which fans either seemed to love or hate. Waltrip was nominated for a Sports Emmy in 2007 for Outstanding Sports Personality.\nWaltrip told Organ there are multiple reasons why now is the right time to move onto the next chapter. Those thoughts of retirement started in 2017; Waltrip originally felt that was the right time, considering his number was 17 for a sizable portion of his career. But feeling he wasn’t quite ready to bow out, Waltrip kept going. Now, though, he’s enjoying babysitting his newborn granddaughter. And after missing out on seeing his daughters grow up, he wanted to be around more to see his granddaughter grow up.\nAnother sign that it was time for Waltrip to contemplate retirement was the insertion of Jeff Gordon to the crew. It’s nothing that Gordon or Fox, did but Waltrip noticed Gordon was more in-tune with the more modern aspects of the sport than he was because Gordon just retired. That was where many, including I, noticed that Waltrip could have been better served in another role on Fox’s NASCAR crew than being in the booth with Gordon.\nKind of like CBS with Phil Simms and Tony Romo, the athlete-turned-analyst who had been retired for 20 years can only do so much around someone fresh out of the game. CBS put Simms into the studio for Romo, who is regarded as one of the best NFL analysts out there because he just retired and knows the modern intricacies of the game as only someone who played would know. Gordon raced these cars and raced against these drivers and Waltrip didn’t. And when the two of them were in the booth at the same time, even those outside the media could notice that Gordon was able to explain some things better than Waltrip.\nTo Fox’s credit, they remained loyal to Waltrip and kept him in the booth. I, for one, had been vocal in wanting to see Waltrip in the",

That isn’t a slight on Waltrip, it’s just the nature of the beast as a former athlete-turned-analyst. If Romo and Gordon choose to have 20-year broadcasting careers, they aren’t going to know as much about the formations or the cars as those things evolve and some newly-retired athlete will come in and eventually be better than them.\nNow that this retirement is official, the NASCAR community can come together to wish Waltrip well as he embarks on the next chapter. Even those who may have been on the side of wanting him to bow out or didn’t care for his lighthearted broadcasting style cannot discount how important Waltrip has been to the sport over the past 45 years. This June will definitely be the end of an era in NASCAR broadcasting and his replacement will have some big shoes to fill.",

The countries share a border, often team up on U.N. Security Council votes and frequently trade military equipment.\nShould the West pursue new sanctions to isolate Russia -- possibly in response to further incursions into Ukraine -- those ties will be put to the test. Moscow could also widen the search for support to Japan and India.\nEnergy supplies are likely to feature prominently in any shift to the East.\nRussia sends more than 7 million barrels of oil a day to the world markets, and its total energy trade earns 70% of its $515 billion in annual export revenue, according to the U.S. Energy information Administration.\nIt has long pursued a natural gas deal with China, but a final agreement between state-owned behemoths Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corp has been delayed by a disagreement over pricing.\nNow, Russia may be willing to accept a lower price in exchange for the security of having another dedicated buyer for its gas.

Even as those hands slowly tighten around our neck.\nWe know from the rising dissonant buzz that opens the movie — here cleverly recast as a swarm of bush bugs — and the generally brooding mood that something bad is going to happen on this camping trip, but MacDonald patiently breadcrumbs out hints and ill omens as Alex and Jenn slowly get deeper into the woods. The most notable comes in the form of a wilderness guide (Eric Balfour) who happens to come across their camp around dinner: the fish he’s happy to share seem like a remarkably less friendly gesture when he pulls out a knife damn near twice their size and guts them. The firelight conversation that follows, with the guide acting distantly mysterious and Alex’s jealousy rising, stays just on the edge of explosion, and even its end offers no relief: now there’s a weirdo out there in the woods, too.\nAs Alex and Jenn tromp towards a lake he promises will be worth it, more ill omens add up. Stepping over a bear track gives way to catching a sniff and a glimpse of a disemboweled deer; taking a marginally more overgrown path gives way to wandering through brambles that don’t seem to have been tramped down before.

Once things firmly go to hell, the camera pulses in and out of focus, which suggests heavy breathing, a quickening heart and the confusion of terror all at once.\nThe result is 90 straight minutes of rising tension, never so much relieved as occasionally back-pedalled to take another mad run at Alex and Jenn and us.

        "prompt": "Does Trump really have ‘absolute power’ to declare a national emergency? Let’s examine the statute.\nEditors’ note: We are reposting this analysis, first published on January 10, 2019, when President Trump had suggested he might declare an emergency at the border.\nWe’ve heard a lot this week about the National Emergencies Act (NEA) of 1976, thanks to President Trump’s claim that the lack of a wall on the southern border constitutes not just a “Humanitarian and National Security crisis,” not just “a crisis of the heart and … of the soul,” but “a national emergency.” He has threatened to invoke the NEA to address that emergency — thus bypassing Congress, as well as that pesky constitutional requirement that all funds spent by the government be appropriated by the legislative branch.\nDoes the president have, as he says, “the absolute right” to do this? Well, very little about presidential power is supposed to be absolute. But the NEA can now be added to the list of statutes passed by Congress during its post-Watergate resurgence that were meant to rein in the presidency but have, in fact, empowered it.\nThe National Emergencies Act was passed in 1976 to reboot the system. It started by phasing out existing emergency powers and setting a one-year (though renewable) limit on future states of emergency. There remain more than 120 provisions in law that are on standby if needed. But under the NEA, presidents had to specify which powers, in which laws, they were activating (i.e., not all of them at once). Any ongoing emergency could be terminated at any time by Congress, which was supposed to regularly consider just that question.\nSo where do we stand? Well, as of 2019, the United States has been in a continuous state of emergency for four full decades — since 1979.\nThat particular emergency was declared by President Jimmy Carter, to freeze Iranian assets after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. It has been renewed every year since, by six other presidents. But others have been added, too, as Lawfare’s Catherine Padhi usefully documents; in fact, CNN counts 31 of them. All but two utilize powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, which allows presidents to impose financial sanctions on hostile foreign actors. Sometimes this has provided a way for presidents to unilaterally implement their policy preferences, as when President Ronald Reagan applied IEEPA sanctions against Nicaragua in 1985 as a substitute for those Congress had refused to enact.\nIs the wall such a project? That’s far from clear — and courts would quickly be asked to decide. The president’s own words might not help his case. He said that declaring an emergency would come “if I can’t make a deal” rather than because of the objective situation on the border. Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman goes as far as to argue that orders to the military to build the wall under these circumstances would be illegal — so illegal that a soldier could be prosecuted for following them.\nBut usually courts are loath to overrule presidential determinations of this sort by substituting their own judgment of what constitutes an “emergency.” In fact, nothing in the statute says there actually has to be a national emergency — only that the president declare that there is one. I’ve written before on presidents’ use of statutory interpretation in their favor; they find new meaning in old laws when they can’t get new laws passed. Trump’s action would do just this — it would build a wall, without first building consensus in Congress.\nAll this means that efforts to constrain executive authority can sometimes legitimate it. The NEA and IEEPA fit into laws passed after Watergate and the Vietnam War that were designed to limit presidential unilateralism and regain for Congress a real say in questions of war and peace, spending and ethics. But the NEA and IEEPA, like the War Powers Resolution, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and the Ethics in Government Act, were what the legal scholar Gerhard Casper has called “framework statutes.” They were laws designed not to solve a particular policy problem but to channel information and authority through new procedures and veto points. At the same time, they took presidential claims that used to be explicitly extralegal and gave them a new statutory grounding.\nBut to make such a framework work? That requires legislators to hold up their end of the bargain, and time after time, Congress has failed to",
        "baseline": " enforce its own prerogatives. For instance, since the NEA’s passage, Congress has never rescinded a declared emergency. These days, it is hard to imagine that it could. The NEA originally allowed legislators to cancel emergency powers with a concurrent resolution — a legislative vehicle that does not require presidential signature to become effective. But a 1983 Supreme Court ruling said such measures were not legally binding. A 1985 amendment to the NEA fixed that problem — but by requiring presidential signature, which also means the possibility of presidential veto.\nPerhaps an “emergency” will remind legislators of their past attacks on the “imperial presidency.” Otherwise, as Justice Robert Jackson wrote, dissenting in the infamous Korematsu case, the powers they provide “li[e] around like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.” And what “plausible claim” comes next?",

But Congress has never done so. The War Powers Resolution was supposed to be a way to force presidents to justify their use of force and to give Congress a chance to terminate it. But Congress has never done so.\nThe NEA and IEEPA are now part of the president’s toolkit, and the president has the power to declare an emergency. But the president does not have the power to declare an emergency whenever he wants. He has to do it in a way that is consistent with the statute. And he has to do it in a way that is consistent with the Constitution.",

The IEEPA was meant to be a way to impose sanctions on foreign actors, but it has been used to impose sanctions on domestic actors who run afoul of the president’s policy preferences. The War Powers Resolution was meant to be a way to limit presidential war-making to 60 days, but it has been used to justify presidential war-making for years on end. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act was meant to be a way to limit presidential spending, but it has been used to justify presidential spending without congressional authorization and to expand presidential influence over the budget process.\nThe NEA is no different. It was meant to be a way to limit presidential power, but it has been used to expand it instead. The IEEPA is no different.

Congress can even vote to terminate the emergency, but the president can veto that vote. Does that mean the emergency is over? Read the statute and you’ll see that it doesn’t say.\nThe NEA is a good example of how the law can be used to legitimate presidential power. For the past 40 years, presidents have been able to declare emergencies and then use the NEA to justify their actions. What’s more, the NEA has been used to justify the use of emergency powers in ways that were never intended by the statute’s drafters.

X number of members could petition for such a vote, which would have to be held in both houses. X was set at the number of the president’s party in each house. Keep in mind that the Republican Party had control of both houses in 1976, and the number of Republican members back then was 144 in the House and 38 in the Senate. But Congress has yet to hold a single vote to terminate a national emergency under the NEA.\nThe question is now whether Congress will respond to Trump’s declaration.

        "prompt": "These three companies have some of the most recognizable brand names in the world. Here's why our team of contributors thinks that each is a great candidate to buy and hold for the long term.\nThe forces of capitalism ensure that almost every company in the world will face a healthy amount of competition. One smart way companies look to overcome the competitive pressure is to make their brand names synonymous with the products or services they offer. Any company that can do so successfully stands a much better chance of increasing its market share over time, which usually leads to higher profitability.\nThat's a big reason we Fools love to buy stock in companies that have created a strong brand name that resonates with its customers. With that in mind, we reached out to a team of our Foolish contributors and asked them to highlight a big-brand company that they believe is a compelling buy today. Read on to find out which companies they like and see if you agree.\nRich Duprey: With all the speculation swirling that Kraft Heinz might make a play for cereal maker General Mills, it's worth noting that Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is the perennial favorite of M&A rumor-mongers. Its combination of powerhouse brands and a global footprint makes it a tempting target, though Warren Buffett has previously said it's too richly valued for him to make a bid on it.\nYet it could make a buyout candidate for someone, particularly a company that wanted to fend off an unwanted acquisition attempt. It's why General Mills has often been thought of as a possible buyer, because it, too, keeps cropping up in takeover talks.\nBut beyond the potential catalyst of a merger, investors should think about adding Mondelez International to their portfolios anyway. It holds the preeminent position in three important categories, including candy, chocolate, and biscuits, while generating 85% of its revenues from the snacks market. It was that growing segment that was the inspiration for Nelson Peltz to advocate that PepsiCo buy Mondelez, split off its drinks business into a separate unit, and focus on the public's snacking habits.\nOf course, Pepsi rejected his overtures and he ended his campaign, accepting instead a seat on Mondelez's board of directors. At less than 10 times earnings and only 21 times estimates -- which, considering analyst growth forecasts, gives it an enticing PEG ratio of less than 1 -- the global snack company should make a tasty morsel for investors.\nBrian Feroldi: You'd be hard pressed to find a company that's done a better job of making its brand name synonymous with beer than Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). The company spends billions of dollars each year to promote its huge stable of brands, which I think has been money well spent. The company now counts 19 brands in its lineup that each pulls in more than $1 billion in worldwide revenue, which creates a moat that competitors have found unable to breach.\nThat moat should help the company continue to churn out profits for decades, but the reason I think Anheuser-Busch InBev is an exciting investing idea today is that it's in the process of buying SABMiller, the No. 2 beer maker in the world. Regulators are still working out the details, but the company believes it's on schedule to close in the second half of the year. Once that happens, this company will control more than 30% of the worldwide beer market, making its already huge moat that much stronger.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev's rationale for the deal is that buying SABMiller will immediately give it a foothold in the emerging markets where it doesn't already have a big presence. Africa looks to be an area of particular interest, as consumer purchasing power in the region is growing quickly and SABMiller holds a strong position in the area. That will position the company for decades of above-average growth as those markets mature.\nWith shares trading for about 24 times next year's earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 3.1%, this is a fairly priced company that's poised to dominate for decades to come.\nDaniel B. Kline: Declining soft-drink sales have been ongoing bad news for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), but the company's stock has mostly recovered. The beverage brand has been trading in the $45 range -- close to its $47.13 52-week high. That's good news when you consider that the company is in the midst of a transformation and net revenue dropped by 4% in Q1 2016, where the company reported earnings per share of $0.36, down from $0.45 in the same quarter a year ago.\nThose numbers weren't awful, and the company's April 20 earnings report showed that the company's long-term transformation has started to work. Overall global volume was up 2%. The company has also stopped the bleeding in sparkling beverages (anything carbonated, including",

In addition, still-beverage sales grew by 7% -- a very encouraging sign that Coke has been able to move away from its reliance on soda.\nThe market has been wary of Coca-Cola because the company still has exposure in soda, a product line that suffers from negative press because of the health problems excessive consumption can lead to. But much of the suffering may be over in that market, and the bottom appears to have been found. Now, 18 months into CEO Muhtar Kent's transformation efforts, the needle is moving in the right direction.\nInvestors are overlooking Coca-Cola because of the soda stigma. But this isn't a cigarette company that had no other products to sell once its market became poisoned. Coke has the product lines and the distribution channels to sell consumers whatever they want to drink in the moment. That ultimately should lead to growth, even if soda sales remain stuck in neutral or go back into decline.",

        "prompt": "More than 30 residents at Warrigal Warilla must undergo a complete health and medical review due to concerns raised by the nation’s aged care watchdog. The Federal health department has slapped sanctions on the facility citing “an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety and well-being of care recipients” following information received by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC). The health department had “serious concerns” in relation to six areas of health and personal care, including medication, pain and behavioural management and palliative care. Additional failures which led to the decision to impose sanctions were in the vital areas of nutrition and hydration; emotional support; privacy and dignity and infection control. “The health, safety and well-being of older people who reside in aged care services is of paramount importance to the government,” a health department spokesman said. The action is another blow for the Warilla facility after a 48-year-old female staff member was charged in early January for allegedly assaulting five patients under her care between October and December. The woman will appear at Port Kembla Local Court on February 27. Under the sanctions, the Arcadia St facility will not be eligible for federal funding for any new care recipients for six months. It also stands to lose its approval as an aged care provider unless it complies with all 44 national standards of care by July 16. Warrigal has also been forced to appoint an advisor and administrator to help the home get back up to standard, and must provide training to all staff. As well, Warrigal CEO, Mark Sewell said the facility had taken further measures to improve standards since the unannounced audit, which took place over six days early last month. He said the Warilla facility had met all 44 standards in July last year, and he was confident all concerns would be addressed by this July. “We are very sorry that this recent situation has developed so quickly over the December/ January holiday period and want to reassure our residents, their families and our staff, we are doing everything we can to turn this situation around as quickly as possible,” Mr Sewell said. “… The special sanction period is for six months and means we wont be admitting any new residents to the home whilst we focus fully on the improvements to the health management of the residents who live at the home, especially the small number of residents the commission has asked us to focus on. “We have confidence that we can turn this situation around very quickly.” Mr Sewell said 31 residents had been specifically mentioned in the audit as needing improvement to their health management. “All of these residents are having a complete health and medical review and we will be implementing every recommendation made by the doctors, nurses, and other health professionals,” he said. The facility currently houses 82 residents ranging in age from 82 to 98, who are cared for by 117 staff. “Their health conditions are complex and include dementia, high care, complex behaviours, dialysis and multi-faceted health issues,” Mr Sewell said. Residents and relatives were informed of the health department’s decision at a meeting on January 30. The health department and ACQSA are continuing to monitor the service. ACQSA – which began operations on January 1, 2019 – will integrate and streamline the governance roles of the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner and the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, creating a new one-stop-shop. It has received funding of almost $300 million over four years; including an additional $48.2 million to expand monitoring, secure aged care quality and employ a network of dozens of additional senior compliance officers. The commission will be underpinned by a new aged care Charter of Rights and is set to enforce a new, single set of Quality Standards, the first upgrade of standards in 20 years.\nThe health department and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are continuing to monitor the service.\nMore than 30 residents at Warrigal Warilla must undergo a complete health and medical review due to concerns raised by the nation’s aged care watchdog.\nThe Federal health department has slapped sanctions on the facility citing “an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety and well-being of care recipients” following information received by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC).\nThe health department had “serious concerns” in relation to six areas of health and personal care, including medication, pain and behavioural management and palliative care.\nAdditional failures which led to the decision to impose sanctions were in the vital areas of nutrition and hydration; emotional support; privacy and dignity and infection control.\n“The health, safety and well-being of older people who reside in aged care services is of paramount importance to the government,” a health department spokesman said.\nThe action is another blow for the Warilla facility after a 48-year-old female staff member was charged in early January for allegedly assaulting five patients under her care between October and December.

        "prompt": "Are you addicted to social media? Daniel McDuff has a shocking solution -- literally.\nDaniel McDuff works at the MIT Media Lab -- also home to fellow WIRED 2015 speaker Hiroshi Ishii -- where he builds scalable tools to enable the automated recognition of emotions and physiology. One of the instruments he designed was the 'Pavlov Poke', a tool designed to wean users off addictive social media sites.\nMcDuff, who is a WIRED Innovation Fellow, worked with Robert Morris to create code that will display on-screen alert if a distracting site is visited too frequently. An Arduino is connected to the computer via USB and when a shock is triggered, the Arduino activates a relay and starts the shock circuit, triggering a current through conductive metal strips placed on the keyboard.\nMcDuff is also interested in emotion, and how it relates to computing -- \"I see emotional connections between humans and devices as being really important,\" he told the audience at WIRED 2015 at London's Tobacco Dock. In 2011, Daniel collaborated with Affectiva to produce the first demonstration of large-scale emotion measurement, using webcams to capture viewers' facial expressions during Super Bowl commercials.\nOur devices, McDuff says, are able to track not only our outward expressions -- a smile or a furrowed brow, for example -- but also the inner manifestations of emotion. Using signal processing, and by looking at the light reflected from the human face, we can measure heart rate, respiratory rate and blood flow. \"Emotions matter,\" McDuff told the WIRED 2015 audience. \"They make us feel alive, they filter what we remember about experiences, they influence what we choose to do and where we choose to go. We're surrounded by amazing tech, but despite the amazing cognitive intelligence computers have, they have no emotional intelligence. They just don't understand humans the way we do.\"\nEmotions matter. They make us feel alive, they filter what we remember about experiences, they influence what we choose to do and where we choose to go.\nEmotionally intelligent tech could have many manifestations; a mirror that could tell how bad your night's sleep was when you looked in it, a fridge that recognised what you were eating and advised you on your diet, or a car that could help you understand exactly the impact of your stress levels as you drove to work. The potential of emotionally aware computing, he says, are devices that can sense, understand and adapt to emotions. \"I have two main passions,\" McDuff told WIRED 2015. \"Education and healthcare. There's been this massive proliferation of high quality online courses, but there's no way for teachers to get feedback from their students -- when they're struggling, or when they're engaged. It would be amazing if we could allow students to simply turn on their webcam and contribute the data back.\" \"In terms of healthcare, there are a number of conditions that are extremely hard to track. Depression, for example, is a condition that affects many people, but clinicians have no good way of understanding how people's feelings are changing throughout treatment -- is a drug having a positive effect, is therapy working? By using this kind of sensor data, we could",
        "baseline": " quantify how people feel, give this data to their clinicians and ensure better care for patients.\"\nSmart watches or smart phones could also help someone who suffers from depression. By tracking blood flow, heart rate, respiratory rate and sympathetic nervous system response, sufferers of depression could share stats with friends, families and clinicians in order to track treatment.\nWhat about those detractors who are worried about the negative potential of a computer that can measure how we feel? McDuff says it's \"crucial that we think about the social impact\" of such technology. \"It's important that people actively opt in to share their data. We often mask our emotions -- we smile when we're sad -- and having the ability to mash our emotions is really important. We're focusing on ways to manage how and when emotions are measured.\" \"Ultimately, I believe that this technology will help us interact much more naturally with the people around us, to live healthier lives, and ultimately help us care for one another more effectively.\"",

        "prompt": "On Monday, Palestinian parties Fatah and Hamas — the latter of which many governments classify as a terrorist group — announced that they had successfully formed a new “government of national unity,” a significant step toward ending the divisions between the two most prominent Palestinian factions. Since a short but brutal civil war in 2007, Fatah has ruled the West Bank while Hamas has controlled Gaza.\nAs I wrote when the unity deal was first announced, it’s important to recognize the extent to which internal Palestinian political dynamics have driven this move. Facing broad popular discontent with their division, the creation of a unity government offers a political advantages for both factions. Reconciliation is hugely popular amongst Palestinians. In March 2011, tens of thousands turned out in both Gaza and the West Bank to call for an end to the division. An April 2013 poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center found that over 90 percent favored reconciliation between the two factions.\nWith the negotiations with Israel (which he entered against the wishes of the majority of his own party) ended for the moment, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas clearly saw reconciliation as something to boost his flagging popularity and at a time when he is in a relatively stronger position vis a vis Hamas.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called upon the international community not to accept the new government, since it is supported by Hamas, who both Israel and the United States classify as a terrorist group.

A key outstanding question has to do with the future of Hamas’ armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. A Hamas source said last month that they would not disband their militia, but instead envisioned a “Hezbollah model” in Palestine, which sounds encouraging to no one. A monopoly over the use of force is regarded as the defining feature of a state, and the record on governments whose parties maintained their own armed forces is not a good one.",

        "prompt": "Prof Itse Sagay (SAN), the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) chairman, does not suffer fools gladly. He is blunt and fiery. A lawyer and teacher of no mean repute, he is not afraid of controversy. He can give as much as he can take. Right from his days as a university teacher till now, Sagay has remained a thorn in the flesh of those he tags enemies of the people. These, to him, are those who do not want Nigerians to enjoy the good things of life as they are now doing under the Buhari administration. In this interview with JOSEPH JIBUEZE, Sagay speaks on the state of the judiciary and what is being done with recovered funds, among other issues.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has blamed the judiciary for frustrating corruption cases. How would you assess the judiciary ahead of the new legal year?\nLet me start by saying that the President was right. The judiciary, acting as presidential tribunals, was a disaster. They did many terrible things, particularly in 2007. That was a most shameless act at a high level, where they could open their eyes and write that a ballot paper without serial number is a valid ballot paper. It never happened anywhere in the world. That was most shameless. There have been a lot of improvements since then, even though we still have corrupt judges. There is no question about that – at all levels. But the level of corruption has gone down. There is an attempt to fall in with the spirit of the anti-corruption struggle that the Buhari administration has introduced.\nI always say that the Chief Justice’s directive that special courts should be designated by Chief Judges of various courts in the country for corruption cases only, and the establishment of a monitoring group, are very excellent ideas. They were ideas we were pursuing for which we were not successful because the National Assembly to whom we sent the bills refused to consider them. But the Chief Justice did it administratively and they’re operating and doing very well. You heard recently that two former governors were sentenced to lengthy imprisonments and it was by one of these courts. So, I’m encouraged by that. But, we’re still watching the Judiciary. Everything is not perfect yet. We’re still far away from the type of Judiciary we had, particularly the type of Supreme Court we had when Eso, Oputa, Mohammed Bello, Obaseki, Karibi-Whyte, Nnamani were there. Then we had the best Supreme Court in the world. It has dropped sharply since then. So, we are nowhere near there. And I keep telling the present crop of judges, including the Supreme Court justices who are all my juniors, that they should aspire to what we had before. They’re not there yet and I want to see them positively aspiring to that.\nSome have said the holidays judges enjoy are too long – from July to September, in addition to Easter and Christmas vacations. In view of court congestion, would you recommend a reduction?\nI have a slightly different opinion. The work of a judge is very, very demanding, mentally and extremely demanding. They have to do a lot of reading to write a single judgment, and do a lot of analysis, and after that begin to crunch their brains about where the law is, and not only law, where justice is leading them. So, if they have a two-month holiday, I don’t mind. My complaint against them is the callousness with which some judges – and many judges do it – will not sit and they will not tell you before hand. You come there prepared; you’ve given up the whole day just for the case, you’re in court and you’ll be told the judge had gone somewhere. The registrar would just tell you the judge had gone somewhere. That’s an insult on the lawyers and an insult on the people of this country, for a judge to just take off, and they have our phone numbers. Nobody will call you. That’s number one. Number two, their conferences are too many. One conference today, another one tomorrow – seminar in Dubai. There is too much laxity, a sort of I don’t care attitude about the sufferings of lawyers and their clients. I do not have the feeling that judges are concerned.\nHave you had a personal experience?\nWhen I was much younger, about 20 years ago, I went to the Court of Appeal, then presided over by the present Emir of Ilorin. I got there and they had pasted something at the gate, after I had left my office. So, I wrote a stinker to him, which he did not take well. He too wrote a stinker back and when next I appeared before the court they gave me hell in a case I was handling before them. But that’s not the right spirit. They were wrong. So, for me, what they should do is cut down on holidays, be more sensitive about their role in the society, and be more concerned about the fate of parties, who want their cases to end. They should also show more respect to lawyers, because when you leave the court without notice that you’re not going to be there and a lawyer comes, that’s an insult to that lawyer. You’re both lawyers for goodness sake. That you’re on the Bench doesn’t make you a different person. That lawyer can become a judge tomorrow. That is lack of respect! And it’s very bad.\nWhat else can be done to address delays?\nTo conclude this part, because it’s a very important point you’re raising, the cases that are outstanding are so many. They go on for 10 years and yet are not concluded. There is need for them to be conscious of this. There is need for the government to provide recording equipment. If you go to London, where I have appeared several times as an expert witness on Nigerian law, the judge has a computer in front of him, and there is a lady who is recording in addition to the computer, and the judge is very relaxed because he is asking questions and not writing anything – very relaxed. At the end of the day, before you go, you get the proceedings. They just roll it out of the computer and you take it home. So, you can see that the judges are living longer; they’re fresher. The judges here have to take everything by hand. You say something, they’ll write. You have to wait for them, and speak very slowly because you know they can’t write at the rate at which you’re speaking. So, it takes a long time. There is strain; they suffer from all sorts of diseases – back diseases, brain diseases as a result. So, we must – there’s no choice – introduce recording equipment. That will hasten proceedings.\nSome courts too are not very honest. At times the vote is prepared and given to them to buy these equipment; they will not buy it. The next year, they will apply again for another vote on the same thing. That is also there. There are lots of problems. We just have to sit down and think of the people of this country; think of the service we’re delivering as one major arm of government and be proud of what we’re doing. As it is now, they cannot be proud. None of us is proud of what is happening now, because cases are taking so long. It’s scandalous. Some cases take over 20 years. The Supreme Court is so congested now that if you file an appeal, don’t expect it to be heard in five years. It’s not good. For me, it’s a failed system that is being run now. The Chief Justice, the National Judicial Council and all these top judges should meet and think of a way out. Maybe one other thing they can do to help them is to have clerks made up of young, brilliant law graduates attached to them to do their research and even write their preliminary judgments, which the judge will then go through and improve upon. But they need to get together and do something.\nWhat is your reaction to claims that the anti-graft war is selective, and that the focus seems to be on those in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)?\nNo. The PDP was in power from 1999 to 2015. They were the ones who had access to Nigeria’s assets and resources. And they had an inclination and orientation of simply helping themselves to state assets without looking back. I mean, it was just a horrible thing. I’ll just give you one example. When they were there, they were fraudulently obtaining petroleum subsidy amounting to N380billion a year, saying they had supplied petroleum products, which they never supplied. You’ve seen all the recoveries that have been made. Look at what they did during the elections when Diezani brought her billions to bribe INEC officials all over the place, including Rivers State. That’s why I laugh when Wike says he has been elected. The Rivers State chief electoral officer was bribed. And she deliberately distorted that election and ensured that it was rigged in favour of Wike. A lot has happened since then. Our reserves dropped from over about $50billion to less than $2billion. They were spending money like water. In the last days, Jonathan was travelling round the West, dolling out huge amounts of dollars to Obas and so on. Look at the former National Security Adviser; look at the amount of money, just walking into Central Bank to take away $46million in sacks. It was so primitive and brazen. That is why they are the ones being prosecuted; because their impunity was so high that I don’t think it’s been experienced in this country before.\nSome still say the EFCC only goes after those in the PDP. They say for instance, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom was accused of corruption after his defection to PDP. Consequently, the state’s account was frozen . To them, the EFCC is being used as a political tool. Are you worried about that?\nNo, I’m not worried at all about that. There must be a good reason they went after him. I don’t have the details. But that man himself…I don’t want to say much. This is a man, who says today oh I’m going to PDP, tomorrow he says no I’m not going again. Then the third day he said I’m gone. And not that he went on his own volition. He said youths forced him… I mean, what sort of human being is that? Is he fit to be governor, a man who doesn’t have his own mind? So I don’t know what he’s done with security money.\nYou’re right, but I can tell you one thing. The EFCC from what I know is investigating all former governors and keeping a tab on serving ones. It has their records, and progressively, given its capacity, one by one, they’re going to be called to answer. There’s nothing they can even do to him. He can’t be arrested. They can investigate him, put down the records of what they found, waiting for him to finish his tenure. Right now nobody can touch him. As for freezing Benue State’s account, I can’t support it. I don’t know why, but the government has to function. I don’t want people to suffer because there are no funds for basic government functions. I don’t know if they really did that; we have to be careful because it looks extreme to me.\nSome still wonder where all the huge recoveries made by the Federal Government are going. How is the money being spent?\nThis issue has been explained again and again and again. This money, one, is being paid to the Central Bank, every kobo. This is Buhari’s government for goodness sake. This is not PDP. Every kobo is being paid to the Central Bank. And in the last two years, N1trillion has been withdrawn from it. For last year, N500billion was used to pay N5,000 each to the poorest households in this country based on the United Nations standards, which was scientifically followed, to get them out of nothingness. The Federal Government is feeding 10.5 million school children every day; children, who otherwise would not have had any nutritious meal. In fact, because of that, enrolment has gone up. Many parents are sending their children to school so that they can eat. It’s going to increase because not all states have joined. As a result, cooks have been given employment – a large number of cooks. Egg sellers all over the country are supplying eggs. Farmers are making sales. The multiplier effect has been tremendous. Young men, who have no skills are being trained and they’re paid N30,000 a month for the period of the training. A lot of young people, particularly women and young farmers, who need capital for their little businesses are being loaned N300,000 each without interest. All they need to do is to pay back the principal sum for their businesses to grow. That’s what the money is being used for. The money is not just being spent. It is budgeted for and approved by the National Assembly.\nWhat is your reaction to the Department of State Services (DSS) siege on the National Assembly, which prevented lawmakers from accessing it?\nIt is most embarrassing. I was watching television when suddenly we saw DSS men blocking people from entering the National Assembly. My initial reaction was that this must have been ordered by the Presidency to avoid violence because we heard some people were going to invade the place. But I was shocked later to find out that there was no such directive; that in fact, it was the initiative of the DSS itself, which is totally illegal. They don’t have that power. They’re supposed to operate under the President’s directive. So, what they did was grossly illegal. They portrayed us in a very bad light, and shutting down parliament in effect. Parliament could be shut down in order to avert worse things. If PDP and APC are going to exchange blows, destroy things and kill themselves, the place could be shut down. But that was not happening. What DSS did was unconstitutional, illegal, and was against the interest of Nigeria as a democratic country. And as soon as the Acting President got to know, he took immediate steps, ordered them out of the place, and of course, dismissed the head of the DSS for doing such a patently illegal thing.\nNigerians have criticised the Buhari administration for not responding to the allegation that Finance Minister Mrs Kemi Adeosun skipped the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme and forged an exemption certificate. What do you think?\nLet me tell you this. I don’t know why the government has not reacted. But, let me tell you my reaction. This woman is a brilliant and extremely valuable member of this government. A lot of the good things happening now – the welfare that Nigerians are enjoying or are going to enjoy, because it takes time, and the way our economy is booming, how we got out of recession – are due to her expertise, her commitment, her sacrifice. There is nothing in this world that will make me remove such a woman from the government. The PDP can weep from now until there is no tear in their body; she is going to be there. We cannot afford to lose that woman.\nWhat about the allegation that she skipped Youth Service?\nYouth Service…Who cares about Youth Service? I don’t bloody care whether she did Youth Service or not. It is irrelevant as far as I am concerned.\nWhat about the allegation that she forged an exemption certificate?\nI don’t believe it. I don’t see anything serious about not doing Youth Service. I don’t see anything serious about it. That’s my own bias, not government’s. I’m telling you now. If you ask me – if I were President Buhari, I would never, ever touch that woman because she’s damn good. The enemies of this government want to reduce his capacity to provide good governance by engaging in social media attacks and trying to get rid of her. It will not work.\nBut the government is not reacting, don’t you see it as an issue?\nI don’t know why. Governance continues.\nBut if the law says every Nigerian under 30 must serve their fatherland, isn’t it a violation of the law to skip NYSC?\nI have nothing against anybody taking part in NYSC. Why not? That is what the law requires. What I am saying is that if, per chance, somebody for some reason misses it, that’s not the end of the world. I did not do NYSC; I graduated before it was introduced. And it hasn’t affected me negatively in any way. So, I’m not going to allow bad belle PDP-type to try to reduce the capacity of this government to do good things and bring welfare to the people of this country by removing a very valuable member of this government. Let me put it this way. I look at the whole picture. If you remove Adeosun from this government, it will adversely affect the government and, therefore, adversely affect the welfare and well-being being enjoyed by this country because of her work. So, I’m not going to allow a little quirk about NYSC to affect that greater value that she is rendering to this country. I am saying that if I were the President, I will not bat an eyelid over that. But that does not mean I am downplaying the importance of the NYSC. No. But I am not going to allow it upset the functioning of the government. Every rule has an exception. There is no rule that is absolute. There are many people in this country today who didn’t do NYSC and they’re working one way or the other because they have a good reason for not serving.\nAs a matter of honour.\nNot as a matter of law?\nNo, no, he’s not compelled by law to do so. He needs to be removed by two-thirds majority. But as a matter of honour. He got there because he was in APC even though he got there by subterfuge, which is typical of him. He got there in a cheeky, fraudulent manner. Nevertheless, for him to be removed, they need a vote of two-thirds, not of the Senate, but of those present and voting at a meeting. So, it doesn’t have to be everybody. It’s those who happen to be there. Once they meet the quorum of one-third, and he is there, he can be removed by two-thirds of that one-third.\nWhat is your message to Nigerians ahead of 2019 elections?\nNigerians don’t appear to appreciate that they’re very lucky to have the present government; that they have a government that is totally committed to the welfare of this country. I think probably since the First Republic and perhaps during the Murtala Mohammed regime and of course, the first coming of Buhari, we’ve never had a government of this type where everybody is charged to sacrifice at little or no expense to the government for this country; where there is zero tolerance for corruption; zero tolerance for self-help; where you have a group of highly committed Nigerians, who are experts in their fields trying to raise us from the pit into which the PDP has pushed us.\nIf we don’t allow this government to continue – I call it the government on the rescue – for four years at least, beyond 2019, then this country is doomed. We’re very lucky to have the team we have now. And it is in our own interest to support them to achieve the goals they have set for this country. I always say that if I were Buhari, I probably would have thrown in the towel out of anger. I’m short tempered when I see the way Nigerians are not showing appreciation for the good that is being done. Let us eliminate those, who benefited from corruption, and they’re many – the elite, people in our own class, they were the ones sharing the money. There was easy money. We need them to get back what we have lost and to build on that to begin to gradually move away from this status of underdevelopment.\nIf you see all the projects – when did you go to the East last? Enugu-Onitsha, the East-West Road, railways, the airports are being upgraded, so much is being done. Abuja has its own city rail. Then there’s a train from Abuja to Kaduna.

        "prompt": "Editors' Note: Updated at 9:14 a.m. ET on Dec. 6 to include new information that OnePlus' future phone will be \"one of the first\" with the Snapdragon 855.\nWAILEA, Hawaii — The Snapdragon 855 mobile processor may have just been announced, but it's already gotten at least one phone maker to reveal its plans for the new chipset. OnePlus, which specializes in affordably priced flagship phones, originally said on stage at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Tech Summit on Wednesday (Dec. 5) that it would be the first to launch an 855-powered device next year. Now, however, the company is walking back that statement.\nCredit: OnePlus/QualcommOnePlus' 2019 flagship will actually be among the first with the new chipset, according to Engdaget, which confirmed the clarification with a OnePlus spokesperson.\n\"We appreciate the opportunity to clarify that we will be one of the first to have access to, and use, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855,\" the statement given to Engadget reads. \"We apologize for the miscommunication.\"\nApparently, the Chinese version of OnePlus' slide deck that was shown at the summit correctly said the startup's next phone would be \"among the first\" to receive the 855, while a mistranslation in the English version wrongly called it the first, full stop. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau had taken the stage early during the Day 2 keynote of Qualcomm's event to make the announcement.\nIt could have been a big win for OnePlus, as the Snapdragon 855 figures to power a lot of flagship Android phones in 2019. Verizon and AT&T have already announced plans to build 5G-ready phones with Samsung next year, and so have LG and Sprint. Since 5G compatibility is a major feature for the Snapdragon 855, it's a safe assumption those chips would run on Qualcomm's latest chipset, too. Yesterday's announcement suggested that OnePlus would beat them to the punch.\nLau didn't disclose exactly when its Snapdragon 855-powered phone would debut. Typically, OnePlus introduces a new flagship every five months. This fall's OnePlus 6T debuted in October, five months after the OnePlus 6's May unveiling. It's unclear if OnePlus intends to speed up that release schedule so that it can be earlier to the market with the Snapdragon 855.\nBut the",

Instead, this 5G-ready, Snapdragon 855-powered device will be separate from OnePlus' regular phone lineup. That could be because this phone will likely cost far more than the sub-$550 starting prices OnePlus charges for its current flagships. Lau estimated that 5G compatibility could add $200 to $300 to the phone's cost.\nQualcomm is revealing more details about the Snapdragon 855 today. But we already know that the new chipset will feature support for an embedded fingerprint sensor — something OnePlus already features in the 6T — an improved AI engine, and an updated image signal processor that adds intelligence to smartphone cameras. We'll have additional information about the Snapdragon 855 as it becomes available.\nIn addition to delivering one of the first Snapdragon 855 phones, OnePlus said it would have the first 5G phone available in Europe, using EE's mobile network.",

It's also the first to use a 7-nanometer manufacturing process, which should make it more power-efficient than the Snapdragon 845, which is currently the most powerful mobile processor on the market. The 855 also features a new \"computer vision\" engine that will help power augmented reality and other AI features.\nThe Snapdragon 855 will be available to phone makers in the first quarter of 2019.",

        "prompt": "When George Roman III started coming to the Canfield Fair 60-plus years ago, it was a simpler time.\nHe grows nostalgic reflecting on those days, when grandparents, parents and kids would pile into their car and head out for a long day at the fairgrounds, picnic lunches in tow.\nHe remembers, too, the days in the 1950s when he and his neighborhood friends would return to comb the fairgrounds for scattered soda bottles after the fair ended. They’d return the bottles to their local grocery store for the 2- and 5-cent deposits that people had paid for them.\nReminiscing on those days, his voice seeps nostalgia.\n“I think it’s a lot of hustle and bustle now. Way back when I started coming to the fair, it was more laid back and easygoing,” said Roman, now the fair director for concessions, grandstand and special attractions.\nLike countless other lifelong fairgoers in the community, Roman has seen the fair evolve to an event that retains many of its traditional features but is constantly updated with modern twists.\nToday’s fairgoers have greater concern for safety and security than when he was a kid. In the 1950s, parents didn’t think twice about sending young children to the fair without adult supervision, he noted.\nThe Mahoning County Agricultural Society started the fair in 1847 as a way to celebrate agriculture. The Vindicator obtained a copy of “The Enduring Traditions,” a book on 150 years of the Canfield Fair written by Charlotte Agustin.\nInside its pages, the beginnings of the fair are given life. Then, fairs were very important to farmers.\n“Unless you can keep up a love and interest in all the various productions of the soil, and its domestic animals, you cannot keep up with your fairs, and if the fairs are not kept up, your fields will not be,” reads an excerpt from Eben Newton’s speech at the Oct. 7, 1862 fair.\nThe founders of the fair “knew that only by attending a fair can people be educated, and only with excited attention can that learning become a lasting enrichment for all,” the book states.\nFrom the beginning, the fair has been filled with dances, music, contests, pageants, parades and animals.\nThe early days brought performances by local talent. After World War II, fairgoers wanted something new.\nIn 1957, Fair Board Director William Kilcawley arranged for the Lennon Sisters to perform.\nField crops and livestock were always an important part of the fair. Back in 1847, there were four vegetable and two fruit and flower classes, according to “The Enduring Traditions.” That first year also brought 30 cattle, six sheep, three swine and 12 horse classes.\nMedical displays began in 1952, and the international exhibits came in 1962. In 1848, the “Ladies’ Fair” featuring arts and crafts was introduced.\nOne aspect of the Canfield Fair that cannot be forgotten is the food.\n“The appeal of food is one of the strongest motivations for repeated visits to the Canfield Fair,” the book reads.\nBack in 1861, one concession sold $200 worth of candy. Isaly’s was a mainstay at the fair in the 1900s with its cones, milkshakes, ice cream sandwiches and swiss cheese on rye bread.\nToday, it’s the DiRusso’s Italian sausage sandwiches, Molnar’s cinnamon rolls and Richardson’s french fries that are among the top concessions.\nRoller coasters got their start at the fair in 1885 when a primitive version was introduced. During the Civil War, swings were the fair’s only ride attraction. Bates Amusement Co. now brings in metal giants to spin its riders around and upside down.\nThe first year of the fair 1,500 people attended. In 2015, the fair drew 282,386 visitors over its six days. In 1979, 539,437 attended the fair — setting an unbroken record.\nAdmission fees didn’t start until 1851 after five acres were purchased for a permanent fair location. Back then, it was one shilling or 12.5 cents to attend the fair. This year, the admission fees range from $6 to $8 for adults depending on the day.\nDespite the changes that have come with time, the fair remains what it’s been for the past 170 years: a tradition and a celebration of Mahoning Valley farms.\nTo commemorate the 170th anniversary of that tradition, The Vindicator looked through the trove of archive files on the fair, which feature decades of headlines noting new attendance records, expansions and improvements at the fairgrounds.

Your unsolicited e-mail (you know, spam) will make recipients hate you. Ask your customers to opt-in to your mailings rather than opt out, most experts will tell you.\nSo along comes Ruth P.

You of course have to give your recipients an easy way to opt out if they wish, she says. Act on their wishes quickly.\nThis sounds like playing with fire to me. I'd worry about customers flagging my e-mails as spam and triggering a review by my e-mail provider. And I'm not sure companies looking at your business as a potential partner or vendor might appreciate this practice.\nBut Ruth brings up a valid point.

John Carney Jr. and Rear Adm. Meredith Austin, Fifth Coast Guard district commander.\nManley drowned nearly two years ago saving his then-17-year-old stepson, Andrew Short, off the coast of Sandbridge, Virginia, after being caught in a rip current.\nIndian River Coast Guard Chief James Pond said Manley’s sacrifice on Sept. 27, 2015, was an inspiration to all Coast Guardsmen.\n“Every day, men and women of this station train to assist anyone in danger out at sea. What your father did is an inspiration to me and my crew,” Pond said, fighting tears as he addressed Manley’s son, Michael Manley Jr., 5, and stepson Andrew Short, now 19.\n“Your father could certainly have served alongside us any day,” Pond said.\nThe Lifesaving Medal is one of the oldest medals in the U.S., and can be awarded to both civilians and members of the military. It is awarded to those who “performed a rescue or attempted rescue at the risk of his or her own life” and who demonstrated “such extraordinary effort as to merit recognition,” according to the Medals and Awards Manual of the U.S. Coast Guard.\nOnly 1,900 or so Silver Lifesaving Medals have been awarded since an Act of Congress established the award in 1874.\nManley, who was a civilian, was also honored with the Carnegie Medal for heroism in February.\nShe said Manley, at 6 feet 3 inches tall, 230 pounds and bedecked in tattoos, had an appearance that belied his inner kindheartedness.\nShe described Manley as a “gentle giant” with a golden heart, who would help anyone with anything whether or not they’d asked for it; who gave money to the homeless, helped strangers and opened the door for anyone, anywhere.\n“It wasn’t because it was the easy thing to do,” she said. “It was because it was the right thing to do. He never wanted anything in return for anything he did, and he’d also be very embarrassed that we were making a big deal out of it today.\nWhat Manley did was recounted by Andrew Short, who said he owes his life and his future to Manley.\nThe skies were clear and the water looked beautiful and calm, he said.\n“Like a villain in disguise,” Short said.\nLike any 17-year-old at the beach would have done, he dove in and swam out. A few short moments later, he said, he realized something was wrong.\n“I turned my head and saw that I was about a football field away from the shore. I got a knot in my stomach like something wasn’t right,” he said.\nShort tried to turn back, swimming straight to shore against the current, and quickly realized he was in trouble.\nManley was right beside him in an instant, he said, telling him to calm down, to relax, to not swim against the current. The words soothed him, Short said, giving him “that extra punch to keep going,” and he made his way to the shore.\n“It felt like it took me 15 minutes, but it was probably only a couple of minutes,” he said. “I’ve never been so exhausted in my life.\n“It was that close, it was just so close,” he said.\nShort finally lifted his head off the sandy shore to tell Manley that he was safe. He said he saw Manley trying to swim back in but, eventually, he vanished.\nManley was pulled out to sea by the same current that nearly killed his stepson.

        "prompt": "New research suggests that low-carb diets may not be the best way to achieve long-term health.\nResearch presented Tuesday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Germany found that diets very low in carbohydrates may raise individuals’ risks of premature death over time.\n“The message seems to be clear,” wrote study co-author Maciej Banach, president of the Polish Mother’s Memorial Hospital Research Institute, in an email to TIME. “We should avoid diets with extremely low and very low levels of carbohydrates,” specifically those that draw less than 26% of daily calorie intake from carbohydrates. Risks may be even more pronounced when that level dips below 10%, Banach says.\nLow-carb diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, largely among people trying to lose weight. But Banach’s research — which comes shortly after a Lancet study that found moderate carbohydrate intake is best for longevity — suggests that weight loss achieved through a low-carb diet may come at the expense of general health, at least when it’s followed for a long period of time.\nThe new study — which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal — used diet and health data from almost 25,000 people collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2010. The researchers found that over an average of 6.4 years of follow-up, people who consumed the lowest amount of carbohydrates had a 32% higher risk of total mortality, a roughly 50% higher risk of dying from vascular diseases and a 36% higher risk of dying from cancer, compared to people who ate the most carbs.\nThe researchers also reviewed seven separate studies on carbohydrates and health, involving around 447,500 people in all. Together, these studies pointed toward similar, if more modest, results. Low-carb diets were associated with a 15% higher risk of total mortality, a 13% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and an 8% higher risk of cancer mortality, compared to high-carb diets.\nIt’s not totally clear why low-carb diets are linked to these health risks, and observational studies like this one can never prove",
        "baseline": " cause-and-effect, only uncover patterns in a particular dataset. But Banach says there are always consequences when cutting out an entire food group, especially if it’s not thoughtfully replaced with healthy alternatives. In the case of carbs, the study says, dieters may run into trouble if they eliminate things like nutritious but carb-heavy fruits, or replace carbohydrates with meat and dairy products. Diets heavy in animal products, versus plant products, may increase a person’s risk of heart disease, and processed meat has been linked to cancer.\nDon’t take that as license to binge on bread, though. Even though low-carb diets appear to come with more risks than high-carb diets, Banach says plenty of existing data, including that from the recent Lancet study, suggests moderation when it comes to carb consumption. Very high-carb diets tend to be heavy on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and snack foods, which are low in nutritional value.",

Low fiber diets are linked with a higher incidence of type-2 diabetes, and type-2 diabetes is strongly associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.\nBanach also suggests that consuming too few carbs could mean consuming too many dietary fats and protein in order to maintain a roughly balanced caloric intake. This could be particularly harmful for cholesterol, since dietary saturated fat can drive LDL cholesterol up and cardiovascular disease along with it.\nWhile high-carb, low-fat diets tend to focus on vegetable sources of carbohydrate like fruits and vegetables, low-carb, high-fat diets tend to focus on vegetable sources of fat, like nuts, or high-calorie and high animal fat sources. This could be part of the explanation for the study’s finding that very low-carb people had a higher incidence of type-1 diabetes, since nuts contain relatively small but still significant amount of animal fat,",

What’s more, low-carb dieting may increase blood levels of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar and has been linked to a higher risk of cancer.\nBanach and his team also found that very low-carb, high-fat diets were associated with a higher incidence of type-2 diabetes, a risk factor for other conditions like heart disease.\nBanach notes that this study was conducted in a relatively small sample size, and that more research on the topic",

It was filed as a political action committee with Metro Nashville last week.\n\"We would lease a large fleet of passenger vans then use rideshare technology to create routes instantly based on demand,\" their promotional video states.\nJohann Porisch and John Maddox said they wanted to join the debate but noticed there was something missing from the major anti-transit plan platforms: an alternative.\n\"Instead of inflexible light rail which only runs on one corridor, the van picks people up in front of their homes,\" Porisch said.\nIt's a modern take on vanpooling, which has been in the Midstate since the 1990s.\nNewsChannel 5 Traffic Anchor Rebecca Schleicher rode along with VanStar in August , after the program reached 900 riders across Middle Tennessee. It's run by a federally-funded group and many of its rider fees are covered by companies who want their employees to have a different option to get to work.\nCBS News recently reported on a small fleet of 10 vans that's seen some success in Arlington, Texas where transit options are almost non-existent.\nBut for some, it's a tough sell just three weeks before early voting begins on the citywide transit referendum.\n\"Any idea that someone can come up with a different idea on the back of a napkin is not really realistic,\" said Ethan Link, a volunteer and transit advocate for Transit for Nashville.\nLink works with unions and is constantly in contact with folks in the construction and healthcare industries. He said the city's plan that would build five light rail lines and overhaul the bus system as well as build neighborhood transit centers, sidewalks, bike lanes and cross walks is the best option for Nashville's future.\n\"What I do have confidence in is a well-engineered, well-planned program that the community has had input on, and that's what's on the ballot on May 1,\" he said.\nSo far, the largest rallying cry against the city's plan has been the price, which is $5.4 billion to put in place, but will eventually reach almost $9 billion over the next two decades when the day-to-day operations costs are also factored in.\nTo pay for the plan, the city proposed a series of tax increases. The one Nashville residents will feel the most is the sales tax increase from 9.25 percent to 10.25 percent over the next five years. That tax increase would sunset in 2068.\nA study commissioned by the Nashville Chamber of Commerce said the sales tax impact on an individual in Nashville will be 34 cents a day, or $10 a month. The Chamber has come out in support of the city plan.\n\"We shouldn't have to pay much higher taxes for a transit solution here,\" Porisch said.\nHe said his idea for a 416-van fleet would cost closer to $60 million to run on a daily basis.\nAnother complaint about the city's plan is that it only covers the Metro Nashville area.\n\"Our traffic problems come form Williamson, Rutherford, Sumner counties,\" Porisch pointed out",

        "prompt": "None of the members of the African Children's Choir wanted to talk about what had happened to them in their homeland of Uganda. That was understandable.\nFew children would want to describe what it was like to watch the brutal murder of their parents.\nThe 24 singers, who spent four months touring Europe and have just begun a one-year tour of the United States, are orphans between the ages of 6 and 13 who were selected from auditions throughout Uganda, a small East Central African country of 14 million and the site of some of the bloodiest civil violence of the past 20 years.\n\"One boy, Ivan, his father was in a store when the soldiers came and wrapped him in cable wire,\" said Jackie McCauley, the choir's director, after a recent performance at the First Presbyterian Church in Inglewood.\n\"The soldiers stabbed him, dragged him back to the house and robbed it. They then took his father away. Ivan never saw him again.\"\nShe said another boy saw his parents shot down in cold blood.\n\"The guerrillas came into the village first and took their food,\" McCauley said. \"Then some soldiers showed up and when there was no food, they accused the village of collaborating with the guerrillas. The soldiers then started shooting randomly and he saw his parents shot as they tried to flee.\"\nAn estimated 500,000 people, almost 4% of the population, died between 1971 and 1985 in a series of wars and purges under dictator Idi Amin and former President Milton Obote.\nBut the horror of the past was not evident as the singing, cheering children marched onto the stage in Inglewood.\nThe church was filled to capacity by an enthusiastic crowd, which was treated to a 90-minute performance that included both tribal and American gospel music. The Christian songs were sung in either English, the official language of Uganda; Luganda, the native tongue, or Swahili, the pan-African language.\nDan Newhall, the pastor of the church, said he found the choir inspiring.\n\"Anybody who felt Inglewood rocking that night, that wasn't an earthquake,\" Newhall said. \"That was the people stomping and clapping at my church.\"\nIn one song, the choir told the story of David and Goliath as two of the boys acted it out. The larger boy towered over the smaller and strutted back and forth. The boy playing David began an exaggerated swinging motion with his arm before slaying Goliath with an imaginary stone from a slingshot, eliciting wild applause from the audience.\nThe choir, sponsored by the Ambassadors of Aid, an interdenominational Christian group, also performed at churches in Long Beach, Redondo Beach and Los Angeles. After the Inglewood performance, the choir left on a tour that includes performances at churches in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Canada and several Midwest and East Coast cities before it returns to the Los Angeles area in December. The money raised will be used to fund six orphanages in Uganda.\nOn the road, the choir travels in its own bus and performs three or four times a week, according to McCauley. Each day's travel is limited to eight hours, she said, and the children stay with families who belong to the churches at which they perform.\n\"It's hectic,\" McCauley said. \"You learn that patience is a virtue. But the children are well disciplined. We make sure they're in line.\"\nMcCauley, a 25-year-old native of Alberta, Canada, said discipline is maintained by using positive reinforcement, not punishment.\n\"These kids have been abused all of their lives,\" McCauley said. \"Many have been tortured. They're used to physical punishment. What they respond to is love.\"\nBecause many of the children, especially the older ones, lack much in the way of a formal education, three accredited teachers travel with the choir and school the children when they are not performing.\n\"We teach them in a manner similar to a correspondence course,\" McCauley said. \"They are tested on an individual basis. For instance, Tom, who is 15 and used to be in the choir and is now our soundman, his level of schooling in Uganda was very low. But through this method, he doesn't feel humiliated and he will eventually finish. If he was back home, they would put him in school with 8-year-olds.\"\nPeter Kasozi, 26, a Ugandan minister who travels with the choir, said distance has helped heal the children's emotional wounds.\n\"The children used to talk about running and hiding from soldiers,\" Kasozi said. \"Now they talk about good things. In California, they've been talking about pizza.\"\nMcCauley said her group's goal is to teach the children about different cultures and help them maintain their own.\n\"We don't have them saying they want to stay here,\" McCauley said. \"What we try to do is open their eyes to what unity in a country can do.\"\nUnity is something that has been in short supply in Uganda's recent history.\nA landlocked country about the size of Oregon, it gained its independence from Great Britain in 1962. In 1966, Obote took power. In 1971 he was overthrown by a coup headed by Amin.\nIn his eight years in power, Amin reportedly ordered the deaths of 300,000 Ugandans, most of whom were suspected of opposing his rule.\n\"During his first few years, Amin was not so bad,\" Kasozi said. \"But when he decided he wanted to become 'President for Life,' he proved to be a bad man.\"\nIn 1979, neighboring Tanzania invaded Uganda to topple Amin, and reinstalled Obote.

Despite some remnants of fighting with insurgents loyal to Amin and Obote, the country has returned to relative peace.\nMcCauley said the children have adjusted well to Western life, but have had some trouble coming to terms with what they see on television and in the movies. The children, she said, believe everything they see.\n\"When we were in Europe we showed them two Disney movies, 'Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang' and 'Herbie the Wonderbug,' \" McCauley said.\n\"When we got to America, they were expecting to see flying cars.\"",

Garnish with a citrus wheel.\nMeg McFarland sipped her first pisco sour – a frothy mix of clear Peruvian brandy, sugar, egg whites, bitters and lime juice – in Lima almost 16 years ago.\nAnd she has since made it her mission to help pisco become appreciated around the world.\nMcFarland founded PiscoLogia, a boutique craft pisco distillery, in Peru in 2008. Recently, both PiscoLogia products – Pisco Pura and Pisco Acholado – were picked up by a national distributor that has accounts in most states as well as Washington, D.C. That means it could become easier to find them in her native Inland Northwest.\nMcFarland isn’t the only PiscoLogia partner with a Spokane connection. She runs her company with two other women, one of whom also grew up in Spokane – although the fast friends and business partners didn’t know each other while they were living here.\nKami Kenna, a longtime bartender in Portland who – like McFarland – grew up and graduated from high school in Spokane – won a trip to Peru in a cocktail competition in 2014 and reached out to McFarland over email when she arrived in 2015. She was interested in learning about Latin American spirits, particularly pisco. The two met at a bar in Lima where they discovered that not only were they both from Spokane but they graduated from high school here a year apart.\n“We played basketball at the same time, but we didn’t recognize each other,” said McFarland, who was already living in Lima. She had married a Peruvian in 2013.\nKenna officially joined the company in 2016. Her role is brand ambassador, educator and international sales. She also does social media for PiscoLogia.\nNati Gordillo joined the business about the same time as Kenna. She’s the master distiller, vintner and sommelier.\nBut, “We all do a little bit of everything,” said McFarland, founder and general manager.\nBy the time Gordillo and Kenna came on board, pisco was already enjoying a surge in sales in North America, particularly in larger metropolitan areas. Since 2010, the spirit has been becoming more and more popular in places such as Los Angeles and New York, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland.\nIt hasn’t yet become mainstream in cities the size of Spokane. But both Kenna and McFarland are hoping to see that change.\nPisco is a clear grape brandy that carries protected status, like Champagne. Grapes are harvested at high brix, or sugar content, then distilled in a copper pot still.\nPisco is the national drink of both Chile and Peru. The spirit has a rich, centuries-old heritage in each country. But rules vary.\nIn Chile, more than a dozen different grape varietals from two regions can be used, although just a handful are popular. Chilean pisco can rest in wood. And it can be distilled to a higher proof, which can be brought down with water. The number of times it’s distilled is left up to the distiller.\nThe Peruvian spirit can only be made from eight particular kinds of grapes from five regions. No other ingredient – not even water – is added.\nPeruvian pisco must be aged in a nonreactive container, such as glass or copper, or clay pitchers informally called piscos. Wood isn’t allowed.\nIn either country, pisco can be enjoyed neat – as both an aperitif and digestif. Of course, it can also be mixed in cocktails, such as the Pisco Sour. Infusing pisco with fruits and herbs is also popular. Most restaurants and bars in Peru and Chile offer these house-made macerados, which are used to flavor cocktails.\nDepending on the kind of grapes used, pisco can carry notes of white pepper, chocolate, blueberry, white flowers and more.\nPiscoLogia produces two kinds of pisco: Pisco Pura, made from 100 percent estate-grown Quebranta grapes, and Pisco Acholado, made from a blend of Quebranta and Italia grapes.\nIn Quechua, a native Peruvian language, the word “pisqu” means bird. Pisco is also a port city in Peru and the capital of the Pisco province. The spirit was first exported from here.\nPiscoLogia’s vineyards and distillery are located in Azpitia, about an hour drive south of Lima. But McFarland lives in Curahuasi, about a two-hour drive west of Cusco. There, her husband, Fernando Gonzales-Lattini, owns and operates Apu Winery.\n“He was looking for perfect conditions and he found them in the Andes in the middle of nowhere – so that’s where I am,” said McFarland, 38.

Having been a producer for Aljazeera, he taught Mass Communication at Australia’s Curtin University of Technology, Malaysia campus, and appeared on BBC, ABC, National Public Radio and CNN, among numerous media outlets around the world. His forthcoming book is: My Father Was a Freedom Fighter: Gaza’s Untold Story (Pluto Press).\nBaroud, whose writings have been praised by Noam Chomsky as “sensitive, thoughtful and searching”, is the chief editor of the Palestine Chronicle, an outstanding online publication dedicated to Palestine issues that enjoys contributions from renowned and prestigious writers from all around the world.\nHe has contributed to Japan Times, the Washington Post, the International Herald Tribune, and Al-Ahram Weekly and will be publishing a new book “Gaza: The Untold Story” with London’s Pluto Press.\nIn this exclusive interview with Foreign Policy Journal, we talked about the latest remarks of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the Durban II anti-racism conference and the subsequent outrages stirred up in the U.S. and Europe, the Holocaust Denial tradition and its impact on Palestine’s cause, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe latest striking controversy surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was the controversial speech of the Iranian President in the UN World Conference Against Racism (Durban II). It actually evoked a series of reflections and responses. Many western diplomats called it “outrageous” and “inadmissible” while the majority of Islamic Scholars and Palestinian authorities lauded it. What do you think about that? What does the public inside Palestine feel about Mr. Ahmadinejad’s remarks?\nIn fact since the Iranian President’s speech, there has been similar criticism of anyone who dares to voice concern regarding Israel’s brutal policies in the occupied territories. The issue is not that President Ahmadinejad uttered “outrageous” comments or not. The true point of contention is the fact that Israel is being criticized in the first place. Since that incident, other such encounters have followed: the rejection of a UN report on Israel’s blatant human rights violations in Gaza, and the fact that the Pope was reportedly upset, and according to Press TV, staged his own walkout, when a Palestinian Muslim scholar called on him to condemn Israeli aggressions, etc. Even if one plays the devil’s advocate, and assumes for a fleeting moment that Ahmadinejad and the Palestinian Sheikh who dared to criticize Israel are indeed “anti-Semitic”, then what would one say to explain the constant criticism leveled at Israel by numerous human rights organizations, former presidents, leading scholars, etc?\nIsrael constantly reduces the debate to that of individuals, not that of its own policies as a way to avoid its responsibility towards international law and the human rights of a subjugated people. Needless to say, Palestinians and many millions around the world are outraged by the double standards practiced by Western governments in dealings with Israel and Muslims, Arabs, and in fact other nations, mostly in the Southern hemisphere, who are still exploitable and lowly regarded. WU members staged a collective walkout over comments made by the Iranian president criticizing Israel, and yet continue to extend a hand of friendship and cooperation towards Israel which has caused indescribable misery to a whole nation; misery that is still ongoing.\nMeanwhile, some critics believe that Iran is forfeiting many of its international advantages and even its homeland security at the cost of defending the Palestinian cause and denouncing Israel. Iran is the most outspoken enemy of Israel on the grounds of defending Palestinians rights. However, the critics believe that Palestinian authorities are showing a reluctant and indifferent approach toward these “sacrifices”, not even bothering themselves to express empathy with Iran in words. What do you believe?\nThese are two different issues, one being Iran’s stance towards Palestine with all of its historic, religious and internal dynamics, and two being the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s stance towards Iran. I will only discuss the latter point.\nThe PA in Ramallah is experiencing an unprecedented challenge to a status quo that was wrought by Oslo and the peace industry which followed. For nearly 16 years, the Oslo culture espoused little political, economic or territorial gains as far as the ordinary Palestinian was concerned. After all of these years, Palestinians continue to be as far away from their political aspirations as they were before the “Peace Process” came into the scene. In fact, in many respects the situation is worse: more land confiscated, more illegal settlements established, etc.\nHowever, not all Palestinians lost out; a few benefited, and accumulated unprecedented wealth and prestige. Those gains were outcomes of the mere “process” itself. In other words, the “peace process” for them, became an end in itself; it espoused a status quo that, over the years, a ruling Palestinian elite learned to live with, and benefit from. That elite is now based in Ramallah, its jurisdiction is largely limited to distributing international aid to friends and cronies.\nThe elite’s problem with Hamas is neither religious, nor political, nor even ideological. It’s merely the fear that any change to the status quo will result in tremendous losses, mostly financial. Also, those who thrive on corruption are most fearful when a non-corrupt body take over and threaten to govern by the law and bring about accountability, which could also mean courts, trials and jail terms.\nIt’s from this point of view that the PA is most distressed when it sees Iran taking a lead in pushing for a change in the status quo regarding Palestine. However, the PA position, while is most belligerent in the case of Iran, has been consistent regarding any entity that voices any criticism of the PA’s conduct, voices support for the democratically elected government of Hamas, or dares to chastise the PA for its human rights violations and subservience to Israel. Threatened regimes tend to be extremely sensitive and reactionary when it comes to outside criticism.\nThe other issue is the custom of Holocaust denial being underscored by Mr. Ahmadinejad. Denying the Holocaust, despite having been a long-term tradition, went under the global spotlight after his fervent remarks in early 2005. Mahmoud Abbas is also branded as a Holocaust denier. What do you think about this issue? Does it make any impact on the betterment of Palestinians’ situation to question the Holocaust?\nTo be clear, denying such a terrible crime against humanity is certainly unethical, to say the least.\nThat said, when the crimes of the Holocaust are discussed, the discussion almost immediately becomes two pronged: one of the Holocaust as a despicable crime against humanity, which should be duly remembered – as not to be repeated against any other nation – and the memory of those who perished in that most dreadful time in history should also be recalled. But there is also another Holocaust discussion, one that is hardly concerned with the plight of humanity and the dignity of people. It’s not about remembrance and is scarcely pertinent to issues concerning human rights. The second reference to the Holocaust is always used in political contexts, often infused to justify vile human rights violations against other nations, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese, and utilized as a pretext to infringe about the sovereignty of other nations, like Iraq, and now Iran.\nTherefore, any discussion of the Holocaust is very central to the current political discussion of the Middle East: Israel in Palestine, Israel vs. Iran, etc. One must learn to distinguish between the Holocaust as a terrible war crime and that which Norman Finkelstein poignantly depicts as the “Holocaust industry”, which is the Israeli, Zionist manipulation of the Nazi’s genocide to achieve specific political goals, which ironically, contributes to further violations of human rights.\nThe short answer is that without discerning the difference between the actual Holocaust, and the terrible manipulation of the memory of its victims, this sensitive subject would hardly be beneficial to the Palestinian people and their rightful struggle for freedom.\nAnd finally, what do you think about the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Should the Palestinians eventually brace themselves for a “two-state solution”, or is there any practical agenda to adopt a one-state way out?\nI am not sure if one can still earnestly discuss a two-state “solution”. Israel has created enough facts on the ground that makes such a formula utterly unworkable. I believe that maintaining the two state solution ruses is part and parcel of maintaining the greater ruse of the so-called peace process. The peace process is fundamentally based on the notion that the ultimate outcome of the process is two states for two people. To accept the fact that two states option is no longer possible, is to demolish the entire peace process discourse, which is terrifying to those who have invested much time and resources in maintaining it.

        "prompt": "It's the economic stimulus' first birthday, but don't expect any big celebrations. The general public's opinion of the bill that authorized the government to spend $787 billion to create jobs and end the recession is that it has been a dud. According to a recent CNN poll, nearly three-quarters of Americans think that at least half the money spent has been wasted. Economists and policy watchers have a higher but still mixed opinion of the bill.\nMost agree that it has created jobs, and the government can specifically point to 600,000 of them. Tax cuts, the extension of unemployment benefits and other measures that didn't directly lead to new hires also boosted the economy. Overall, economic forecasters such as Moody's Economy.com and IHS Global Insight say the bill generated paychecks for anywhere from 1.5 million to 2 million people who would have been out of work this past year without the stimulus.\nBut what makes the bill's success hard to judge is that it was oversold. Before the stimulus was passed, a report from President Obama's economic advisers predicted that the bill would ensure that the unemployment rate would remain at 8% or below. By that estimate, the bill looks like a failure. A few months ago, the unemployment rate hit 10%; currently it is 9.7%.\nAnother problem is that the bill included a huge jumble of programs. How do you evaluate the $10,090 of stimulus money that was spent in Ely, Nev., to build a fence to keep cattle off a highway?

But what is clear is that keeping people employed was costly. Even if you take the high end of the employment estimates  2 million jobs  the government has spent $140,000 per job created. Surely, we should be able to employ people for less. \"If you put that much government resources into the economy, you are going to boost GDP,\" says Vincent Reinhart, resident scholar at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute and a former top Federal Reserve economist. \"But I don't think we got a lot out of it.\"\nHere is a rundown of a few stimulus programs and how they turned out.",

The rest will be spent over several years and might have a better chance to spur long-term growth.\nThe bill's biggest success story is probably the extension of unemployment benefits to 99 weeks from 26 weeks and the expansion of eligibility to include more self-employed workers. The extension has put money in people's pockets and the expansion has kept people from the unemployment rolls for now.

Virtually every economist thought that the recession would be very deep and long without a stimulus. Yet the legislation still managed to stimulate the economy, he said.\nMoreover, the bill's stated goal was to create jobs now and to spur long-term growth. Yet the Congressional Budget Office found that roughly 40% of the money was used to pay for programs that will continue to be funded even after the recession ends.

For the same reasons, Mider says that he can't say whether the stimulus was worth the money. Many economists agree with that view.\nStill, there are some signs that the stimulus is working. You can find evidence of it, Mider says, in places where the government has been able to measure the stimulus' success.

        "prompt": "OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 30, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Chabot Astronomers are tracking the latest supernova about 12 million light years away. Identified as \"2014J,\" a Type 1A supernova, the phenomenon is occurring in Messier-82 (M82), also known as the Cigar Galaxy. Supernovae occur when a star explodes emitting a massive amount of energy in a short span of time; the star literally collapses under its own gravity. 2014J actually exploded about 12 million years ago, but is only visible now because of the distance its light has had to travel through space.\nAll Type 1A supernovae have the same intrinsic brightness, so are very useful tools for astronomers in determining the distance to the galaxies in which they explode. By measuring the apparent brightness of the supernova and comparing it to what we know the true brightness of a Type 1A supernova to be, astronomers can calculate the distance with good accuracy.\nChabot astronomer and astrophotographer Conrad Jung, and his team are tracking and photographing 2014J through Chabot's 36\" reflecting research telescope Nellie and comparing to images taken ten years ago. Astronomer Gerald McKeegan stated, \"Although the supernova was discovered on January 21st, researchers have determined that the initial explosion occurred on January 14. For Type 1A supernovae, the luminosity ramp-up typically takes 18 to 20 days, so it should reach maximum brightness around February 2nd. Thereafter, it will gradually fade, losing about 2 magnitudes in luminosity by the end of February. If the 18-20 day luminosity ramp up profile holds true for SN 2014J, then it should be just about at maximum magnitude this coming weekend February 1st and 2nd.\"\nNellie will be pointed at SN 2014J for public viewing this weekend, weather permitting.

That is until Tuesday, when the wheels came off the Canadian bus in a shocking display.\nCanada entered the hostile confines of a soldout Estadio Olimpico Metropolitano knowing that a tie or win would be enough to move on to the final round of qualifying in the CONCACAF region, which covers North and Central America and the Caribbean. The Hondurans, looking to please their fans on an extended national holiday, needed a win.\nAsked if the moment had got to his team, Canadian coach Stephen Hart offered a one-word answer — \"Yes.\n\"You're supposed to go down all guns blazing, you're supposed to fight,\" he added. \"You're supposed to die out there.\n\"We were horrible. ... It's disturbing to me that the team fell apart.\"\nIt was Canada's worst loss since an 8-0 drubbing in Mexico in 1993.\n\"We pretty much embarrassed ourselves,\" said midfielder Julian de Guzman.\n\"We were terrible ... It's an absolute low for us,\" added captain Kevin McKenna.\nHonduras's speed and clinical finishing — combined with Canada's clown-like defending — ended the suspense very early, racking up four goals in a 25-minute span to lead 4-0 after just 32 minutes. The Central Americans made it look easy against a sluggish Canadian side that simply wasn't up to the challenge.\nIt was men against boys.\n\"We let in goals early and fell apart. Mentally and physically,\" said Hart.\nJerry Bengston and Carlo Costly each scored three goals for Honduras, while Mario Martinez added two of his own.\nSubstitute Iain Hume scored a consolation goal off a nice free kick in the 76th minute before Bengston restored the six-goal cushion six minutes later as the Canadian defence crumbled around him. Costly then scored on an 88th-minute header to complete the rout.\nHart said personally he thought he had done his best but could have to consider his future in the wake of the \"crushing\" result.\n\"All I can do is ask the fans' forgiveness on behalf of the players,\" said the coach, who has six months remaining on his contract. \"I know they'll never forgive me but on behalf of the players, forgive them.\"\nReminded he was not on the field, Hart said: \"It's my responsibility.\"\nMcKenna disagreed, saying blame should not be laid at the coach's feet.\n\"It was all to do with the players. Stephen Hart had us well prepared for every game that we've gone into, at least since I've been with this national team,\" he said. \"It would be a same if they point the finger at the coach. It was all the players.\n\"We drew Honduras in Canada and we should have won that game. To come down here and to lose 8-1 is devastation.\"\nBut someone will likely have to pay for this disaster.\nA Canadian Soccer Association spokesman said immediately after the game that president Victor Montagliani would not speak to the media until he had a chance to talk with Hart first.\nIt was the worst start possible for Canada, forced on the back foot almost from the get go after Tosaint Ricketts was unable to get a foot on the ball from in front of goal just after the opening kickoff.\nThe Hondurans scored in the seventh minute as McKenna and then fellow centre back Andre Hainault failed to corral a high, awkward bouncing ball. Bengston went through the middle and got a foot to the ball to poke it in.\nThe Honduran forward disappeared in a sea of teammates before emerging to look at the crowd and pound the 'H' on his jersey.\nSimeon Jackson almost tied it up minutes later, but his shot hit the post and goalie Donis Escobar saved the rebound chance from Ricketts.\nThe second goal came in the 16th minute after de Guzman was dispossessed in midfield. Martinez's shot was stopped by Lars Hirschfeld but Bengston was all alone to tap in the rebound.\nCostly made it 3-0 in the 28th on a diving header after Bengston played provider, heading a cross back across goal that an outstretched Hirschfeld was unable to get to.\nMartinez then made it 4-0 in the 32nd minute, poking the ball through a Canadian defender's legs at the edge of the penalty area and then stroking a shot home to cap off an effortless attack that started deep in Honduras territory.\nThe Honduran goal bonanza continued early in the second half as Martinez sent in a cross that Costly headed past Hirschfeld in the 48th with ease.\nMartinez twisted the knife further with a beautifully curled shot from just outside the penalty box in the 59th minute, upping the lead to 6-0. The crowd went wild, again.\n\"There's no excuse. No excuse,\" Hart said. \"Everybody said they were good to go. They trained well. Individually we fell apart defensively. The first three goals were basically given to them and it was over.\"\nTuesday's showdown came in a country infamous for the highest per capita murder rate in the world and a city known as the most violent on the planet. Guns are everywhere with citizens allowed up to five firearms per person.\nThe game was supervised by a FIFA security expert from Europe, called in by Canada after concerns about fan harassment at its hotel in Panama. There were no such problems at the hotel here.\nMore than 400 police were expected at the stadium to marshall the 40,000-capacity stands and the San Pedro Sula police chief told both teams at a meeting Monday that spectators would not be allowed to bring weapons into the stadium.\nA handful of police stood along the sidelines, leaning on their riot shields prior to the match as the Canadians came out for their warmup. In the stands, fans stood two or three deep in the aisles.\nMike Klukowski came in for the ailing Ante Jazic while Nik Ledgerwood was in for suspended striker Olivier Occean, playing a more defensive role in midfield.\nJackson was the lone striker up front.\nBuilt in 1997, the venue is a crumbling eyesore with barbed wire and a dry moat around the fenced-in pitch.\nThree hours before kickoff, the stadium was a cacophony of noise with horns drowning out the public address system. But the stadium announcer did his best to be heard above the din, yelling \"Honduras, Honduras, Honduras\" repeatedly in a bid to ramp up the din.\nThe main stands at the crumbling stadium were a sea of blue-and-white.\nFortunately for those in attendance, there was some cloud cover to take the edge of 30-degree-plus heat. But the sweat still dripped in rivers.\nThere were dancing girls, drummers and giant puppets. And that was before the players even came out.\nThe Canadians walked onto the pitch in tracksuits about 75 minutes before kickoff to chants of \"Honduras, Honduras.\" Several of the Canadians applauded the amped-up crowd.\nFifteen minutes before kickoff, the crowd was doing the wave and yelling \"Ole, Ole.\"\nLa Prensa, the local newspaper, printed a 12-page special on the game with a front-page cartoon of an anxious looking Canadian being tossed in a frying pan in the shape of the stadium while a Honduran player looked on. \"You're toast,\" ran the caption.\nThe paper also promised on its front cover that 38,000 people in the stadium and eight million around the country will be urging their team on with the \"sacred\" cheer of \"Honduras, Honduras, Honduras.\"\n\"Football is like the happiness in this country,\" explained Wilfredo, who works at the hotel where the Canadians were staying, \"because we have many troubles.\"\nCanada foundered at this very stadium four years ago, losing 3-1 in a game that eliminated it from advancing.\n\"It's going to stay with me a long time,\" added McKenna.\nThe Canadians have not made the final round of qualifying in CONCACAF since 1997 when they went 1-6-3 to finish last.\nCanada's only trip to the World Cup came in 1986, when it failed to win or score a goal.\nIn the other Group C game Tuesday, Panama (3-1-2) drew Cuba (0-5-1) 1-1 and finished first in the group.\nThis qualifying round went fairly smoothly for Hart's team. Canada took maximum points from Cuba and defeated Panama 2-0 at BMO Field. But the team failed to convert scoring chances in a 0-0 home tie with Honduras and underperformed in a 2-0 loss in Panama City.\nHart's offence sputtered for much of the round, a problem that was exacerbated when playmaker Dwayne De Rosario went down in Panama with a long-term knee",

Since 2005, there have been 180 major attacks against aid workers in Afghanistan, 150 in Sudan and 100 in Somalia, according to the report released this week called \"To Stay and Deliver.\"\nThe increased violence comes amid a proliferation of nongovernmental aid groups, including 280 in Afghanistan, said former U.N. humanitarian chief Jan Egeland, who along with two security experts conducted the report for the U.N.

        "prompt": "Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nBy Louis Jacobson on Wednesday, October 5th, 2016 at 12:43 a.m.\nTim Kaine claimed that Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\" Mostly False.\nDuring the vice presidential debate, Tim Kaine deployed a longstanding Democratic talking point against his Republican rivals -- that Republicans can’t wait to privatize Social Security.\nKaine said, \"Here's what Hillary (Clinton) and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.\"\nPence’s response was that \"all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it.\" Kaine countered, \"Go read the book.\"\nKaine’s wording was careful, but he left a clear impression that Trump would privatize the retirement program while Kaine and Clinton would protect the existing system.\nAs it turns out, Kaine is on target with the reference to a Ponzi scheme in Trump’s book. But it’s a big stretch for Kaine to use a 16-year-old book as evidence that the Trump-Pence ticket would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nAs we’ve noted before, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement.\nThe upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security.\nThe downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program.\nThe most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into \"personal retirement accounts.\" Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation.\nA few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress.\nThese two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the \"third rail\" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates.\nFor this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term \"privatization\" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology.\nIn Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, he directly compares Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. \"The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,\" Trump writes at one point. \"The pyramids are made of papier-mache.\"\nHe also wrote in the book, according to BuzzFeed, \"This is the second year Social Security benefits have been paid. The first recipients of Social Security, even once inflation was factored in, got the equivalent of a 36.5 percent annual interest rate on their initial contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund. For those retiring in 1956, their inflation-adjusted rate of return was still a respectable 12 percent. Julie Kosterlitz, in the National Journal, compares that figure with this: For those who are working now and looking to retire after 2015, their returns will be below 2 percent. And that’s if they ever get paid at all. Does the name Ponzi all of a sudden come to mind?\"\nIn his book, Trump proposed allowing \"every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches.\"\nSo Kaine has a point that Trump once supported partial privatization of Social Security and called it a Ponzi scheme. But that was 16 years ago, and the Clinton campaign did not provide us with any more recent evidence after the debate concluded.\nSo what about Trump’s position today?\nAs we’ve reported, Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. He’s also been fairly consistent during the campaign -- a statement we can’t make about other policy issues.\nIn September 2015, he said on CBS’ 60 Minutes, \"What I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we’re going to save it without increases. We’re not going to raise the age and it will be just fine.\"\nHe told a crowd in Georgia in February, \"We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts.",
        "baseline": " Mark my words.\"\nHe also responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program.\n\"If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being,\" he said.\nKaine said that Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.\"\nKaine cited an old stance, but it needs updating. Back in 2000, Trump did support privatization and call Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But now, 16 years later, Trump has offered relatively vague -- but relatively consistent -- statements that support keeping the structure of the program as is, without enacting changes as significant as private accounts.\nPublished: Wednesday, October 5th, 2016 at 12:43 a.m.",

        "prompt": "You have no doubt seen them, those feather-topped reeds that line roadside ditches and punctuate highway medians. Just another plant, swaying prettily with the breeze.\nBut if you were to fight your way through a mature thicket of phragmites, you’d be hard-pressed not to ascribe to them a malevolent personality.\nTheir dense root system emits two toxins that choke out rival plants; the tight-packed stems crowd out nutrition and space for any other living thing; and just one shoot can spread to become hundreds in a single season.\nYou can burn them, drown them, poison them, cut them, crush them and they will still resist extermination.\nBut a decade after phragmites (pronounced frag-MY-tees, both singular and plural) was named Canada’s worst invasive plant, community groups in the front lines of eradication efforts are still beating the bushes for funding from provincial ministries, municipalities, agencies, cottager associations and environmental and conservation bodies.\nAnd, most frustrating to area phrag-fighters, is that a herbicide that’s used successfully as a control tool elsewhere is not permitted in Ontario wetlands.\n\"It’s just such a massive, massive undertaking,\" says wetland biologist Janice Gilbert, founder of the Ontario Phragmites Working Group and the expert other experts turn to for advice. \"The shame of it is that it’s got this far.\"\nGilbert has been called upon to advise on and help manage phragmites at Long Point, and all along the Lake Erie coastline, in Lake Huron and Lake Ontario communities and as far north as Thunder Bay.\nThey’ve thrown virtually every tool at the plant: chopping it far below the waterline to starve it of oxygen, applying herbicide during the dry season, rolling over it and doing a controlled burn.\nBut, Gilbert said, \"We’re fighting with our hands tied behind our backs.\"\nThe herbicide they use is approved only under certain conditions, on dry land.\nBut Michigan, British Columbia and Alberta have approved and are using a herbicide (usually applied by helicopter) that’s safe to use against in-water phragmites.\nMPP Monte McNaughton (PC — Lambton-Kent-Middlesex) wants Ontario to also approve its use.\nHe also wants the province to declare phragmites a noxious weed, which would permit officials to go on private land to control it. He has asked the province to step up existing efforts to get rid of phragmites along roadsides and in ditches and has offered new Natural Resources Minister Kathryn McGarry a tour of problem sites.\n\"Phragmites is a growing environmental and economic threat to Ontario and we have to deal with it as quickly as possible,\" McNaughton said.\nThe province is fighting against 441 different invasive-plant species and its strategic plan against them includes prevention, detection, response, management, adaptation and collaboration. Much of its phragmites work has included researching and mapping it and, since 2007, working with other groups to fund its removal.\nThat includes projects such as the Lambton Shores Phragmites Community Group, led by Nancy Vidler.\nIn 2008, Vidler discovered the plant that had begun to invade the beach and crowd the rare coastal meadow/Carolinian ecosystem near her home had just three years earlier been named by Agriculture Canada the worst of the worst invasive plants.\nShe mobilized neighbours and municipal leaders and got enough funding for an extensive cleanup there and all along the shoreline. Nearby Kettle and Stony Point First Nation did the same and now several area municipalities also are working to control the weed in waterways and ditches.\nCleanup costs have run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nNow native lilies grow in patches here, crayfish nests have emerged, a kingfisher dives into the water over there — all where a nearly impregnable wall of phragmites stood only two years ago.\nKeeping on top of it is more than a one-year, one-committee, one-government job, said Vidler, who is so passionate about the project that her licence plate reads PHRAGLDY and she received hip waders as a Christmas gift.\nEven with committed local people using the best available science, there are still large \"orphaned\" areas that are too wet or where property ownership is too muddled for adequate treatment measures.\nAnd that means a risk the untreated areas will encroach into the treated ones.\n\"See that cell?\" Vidler said, first pointing to a few stalks poking up near shore, and then to 40 hectares that have yet to be treated along the Lake Huron waterfront near Kettle Point. \"That’s just small, and then the shoots go out and then all of a sudden, boom, it’s like that and people say, \"Where is our coastline?\"\"\nShe said collaboration has been key. \"You can’t expect that one group is going to pay for the cost or do the work. We’ve found that the best approach is working with the partners to get rid of it.\"\nVidler and the municipality aim to eliminate phragmites here by 2020.\nSo does St. Thomas, where a phrag-fighting team has become a committee of city council.\nWith an annual budget of $13,000, St. Thomas hopes to have treated most areas of the city by the end of this year, said David Collins, chairperson of the Phragmites Control Committee.\n\"Nothing lives or eats or nests in phragmites,\" he said.\nHomeowners around Lake Margaret once couldn’t see the water from their backyards. Now, there are only scattered strands of it. \"The turtle ponds are already returning to life.\"\nBut many believe Ontario is losing the phragmites war in spite of many successful battles.\nProjections by Gilbert and others — including a study commissioned by Great Lakes mayors that used NASA satellite imagery — suggest small pockets of plants will multiply exponentially and already large areas will only grow unless there’s a concerted eradication effort.\nAnd that will ultimately mean habitats are lost, species-at-risk become endangered, property values drop and fields become flood-prone when drainage ditches become clogged.\n\"A lot of people that are in the urban areas",

You have to be, otherwise you would just give up.\"\nInvasive plant originating in Eurasia and causing damage to Ontario’s wetlands and beaches.\nSpreads quickly and out-competes native plants both by its sheer density and its roots that emit a toxin that kills surrounding plants.\nProvides poor habitat for wildlife.\nIncreases fire hazards and can impede swimming, boating, angling, farming.",

        "prompt": "Rumors are flying about dirty tricks, everybody's nervous that something might go wrong, and Democrats will have another caucus mess on their hands.\nRENO, Nevada — Susan Sarandon is worried about Saturday’s Nevada caucuses.\n“This is so complicated as far as I'm concerned,” she said.\nSarandon turned her critiques into a dark joke, delivered with a movie star’s smile. “You know what they say! Democracy's messy so that's the way it goes,” she said. “But everybody eat ahead of time, apparently. Don't let your blood sugar drop.\"\nAhead of Saturday’s caucuses, people are worrying about something really going wrong here in Las Vegas. First the party was concerned about having enough volunteers. Now, conspiracy theories abound, and the fear that Nevada will look like the mess earlier this month in Iowa is haunting both Democratic campaigns. In Iowa, the complicated structure and tight result led to the image of an election being decided by a series of coin flips.\nNobody wants Nevada to look like that, and state campaign officials bristle at the suggestion Iowa is a preview of the Nevada caucuses.\nBut everyone else has something to worry about.\nClinton supporters were chattering Friday about rumored Republican efforts to take advantage of a loophole in the system to register and caucus with the Democrats for Bernie. The state party and the Nevada Secretary of state warned that Republicans attempting to pretend they’re Democrats to caucus could disqualify them from caucusing with the GOP next week.\nMeanwhile, the Sanders campaign, burned by an Iowa caucus process they still say wasn’t fair, has built a robust “election protection program” for Bernie volunteers to fall back on if things go sideways. The system was built, based in part, on lessons learned in Iowa: It includes a handful of attorneys on hand and a hotline for Sanders precinct captains — the trained Sanders partisans on hand to wrangle the rest of his supporters during the raucous caucus process. The team includes experts on the Nevada system, ready to pounce and contest things they think are not going well.\nCaucus are always hotbeds of partisan conspiracy, but after Iowa, things are even more torqued up than usual. Part of it is Nevada and the craziness of last time. In 2008, Clinton won the popular vote, but President Obama won the most delegates. That led to headlines declaring two Democratic winners — something that still stings here, and has led many to expect a less-than-smooth Saturday once caucusing gets rolling.\nChris Newman, a lawyer and immigration activist from Los Angeles who once monitored a Hugo Chavez election in Venezuela in 2007, is coming to Las Vegas in his personal capacity to monitor the polls.\nHe said he doesn’t personally suspect foul play from Clinton, but said \"widespread reporting\" that a number of precincts came down to coin tosses in Iowa contributed to concern that there could be attempts to game the system, which would lead to distrust over the results.\n“You could see that there were a lot of concerns and even some conspiracy theories about what happened in Iowa and this is the best way to avoid that type of situation and ensure the legitimacy of the process,” he said.\nThe central report in recent days has been that the Sanders campaign is calling lists of Republican voters and telling them to change their registration and vote Saturday in the Democratic caucus, according to a source familiar with the Clinton operation in the state.\n“They are the ones inviting Republicans,” the source said.\nAndres Ramirez, a Nevada superdelegate and longtime Democratic operative who endorsed Clinton at a rally Thursday after the MSNBC/Telemundo town hall, said that — if it’s true — the Sanders campaign is within its rights to do what it’s doing, but is misinforming Republican voters.\nRamirez, who is helping the Nevada Democratic Party",

Today two members of my widow support group – Irene and Candy – and I decided to get together for brunch and go up to the cemetery to visit our spouses. We usually go somewhere in Ocean Beach, but wanted something different this time so, after looking at the “Beacon” list of top restaurants, we decided to try the Red Sails Inn.\nThe first thing I noticed was that the “musty” smell that I remember from twenty years ago was gone. The restaurant hadn’t changed much nor had the menu. The breakfast menu consisted of approximately 20 items, plus a number of different kinds of omelets and side dishes. The price range was from $4.95- $11.95. The lunch menu had 8 kinds of burgers, 13 different sandwiches, 2 soups, and an array of seafood dishes, as well as salads.\nCandy was not as hungry and she ordered a bowl of steaming hot clam chowder – $3.95 – and a bowl of coleslaw for $1.75. She said that both the chowder and coleslaw was good.\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict – $9.95 – and had my choice of hash brown potatoes or homemade fries. I first ordered the hash browns, crispy, but later changed the order to fruit instead of potatoes. When my order arrived, the switch had not taken place and there were very crispy hash browns on the plate. Debra quickly brought me a bowl of fruit, and left the potatoes.\nWe were a little concerned that three people that came into the restaurant after us placed their order at least 6 minutes after we placed ours. They were served first – different waitress – and we were prepared to have our order served to us cold. That was not the case. Even though the three ahead of us were almost finished with their meal before we were served, our food was hot and tasty. The ham on my Benedict was a nice slice, and although not piping hot, was palatable and I did not ask to have it reheated. Irene’s pancakes were also just on the border of warm/hot, but she said they were delicious.\nThe view out the window was delightful and even though it was too cold to eat outside, we felt a coziness inside the restaurant.

        "prompt": "For patients experiencing ischemic stroke - the leading cause of disability in the U.S. - time to treatment is critically important for avoiding irreversible brain damage. A study by researchers at Overlook Medical Center and Atlantic Health System published by the journal Stroke shows that patients evaluated in ambulances while in-transit to the hospital, could be treated with the brain saving drug alteplase 13 minutes faster once in the Emergency Department (referred to as door-to-needle, or DTN, time) than patients not evaluated with in-transit telestroke (ITTS).\nThe first-of-its-kind study assessed 89 presumptive stroke patients in ambulances over 15 months (Jan. 2015-Mar. 2016). Atlantic Health System paramedics responding to neurological emergencies used an InTouch Xpress device - a portable unit with a high-definition camera, microphone and screen - allowing video communication with a stroke neurologist who performed a neurological evaluation of the patient while in-transit to the emergency department (ED). Once the patients arrived at the participating hospital's ED, the neurologist assumed care and, when indicated, administered alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) that breaks down blood clots to restore blood flow to the brain.\n\"We are constantly looking for ways to treat stroke patients as quickly as possible, as each passing minute of lost blood supply translates to more brain damage,\" explained John J. Halperin, M.D., lead study investigator and chair, department of neurosciences at Overlook Medical Center. \"Our observations suggest that in-transit telestroke may provide a scalable, inexpensive way to expedite stroke treatment. We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will encourage more hospitals and ambulance corps to adopt telemedicine for stroke.\"\nNew Jersey's EMS is organized in a two-tiered system, comprised of over 500 Basic Life Support (BLS) units and 22 advanced life support (ALS) units. When ALS paramedics are engaged by 911 dispatchers, they join BLS first responders at the scene and then accompany the patient to the ED. Atlantic Health System has two ALS units serving OMC and covering a population of 300,000, and two ALS units serving CMC and covering a population of 160,000.\nEach of these four ALS units was provided an InTouch Xpress device, which is clamped onto BLS ambulance stretchers, allowing images to be transmitted by 4G wireless during patient transport. Atlantic Health System paramedics determined patient eligibility, then collaborated with the stroke teleneurologist in performing the neurological evaluation. In the ED, the stroke team, typically with the same stroke neurologist performing in-ambulance assessment, assumed care.\nFrom January 2015 through March 2016, all patients managed by these four ALS units, with an abnormal Cincinnati Stroke Scale or otherwise suspected stroke, brought to these two EDs, were assessed with in-transit telestroke (ITTS). We compared DTN and last-known-well to needle (LKWTN) times in this group with all other intravenous alteplase - treated stroke patients brought to these two EDs by EMS. Twenty-five treated walk-in stroke patients were excluded. Analysis was intention to treat; patients with failed ITTS were included in the telestroke group. Prespecified primary outcome measures were the differences in DTN and LKWTN times between these two groups.\nEighty-nine patients with suspected strokes were evaluated by ITTS. There were no misses; all alteplase-treated strokes brought to the Over",

His claiming 96% accuracy hides the stark fact that the percentage of unconfirmed entries varies by local authority and range: from just over 0% to 23%, all in areas that will have at least one significant election in May 2016.\nThe absence of vital information about unconfirmed voters, the commission wrote, “means that ministers would need to ask parliament to approve an important decision with no reliable information about how many redundant entries would be removed from the December 2015 registers and how many otherwise eligible electors would need to re-register individually in order to be able to participate in the 2016 polls”.\nAmong those missing from the register are those aged 16 and 17, who will shortly become eligible to vote. Numbers registered in May 2015, at 247,705, represented a fall of 47% from the last household canvass, when 470,398 young people were registered. The position may improve but won’t be clear until spring 2016.\nThe government intends that the registers published in December 2015 will be used as the basis for calculating the size of constituencies as part of the next UK parliamentary boundary review. London boroughs – including Brent, Hackney, Haringey, Lambeth, and Redbridge, with their high count of Labour voters – are among authorities that have 10% or over of their total registers unconfirmed. Hackney has the highest level, at 23%. No point to be made about gerrymandering there, then, minister.\n• John Penrose writes that individual electoral registration (IER) will not disenfranchise people. Not in law, it won’t, but published academic research shows how IER will lead to a further decline in registration levels. The logic",
        "baseline": " is simple: the more bureaucratic the registration process is, the less people will engage in the democratic process.\nThe same research has also shown that IER has many side-effects. It can divert election officials’ time away from other activities, affect morale and cause staff to leave. This is borne out by a recent report by electoral administrators, which the minister cites in support of his argument.\nDespite the introduction of online electoral registration last year, which was a huge step forward, the numbers on the electoral roll are at crisis levels, with a dramatic decline in the post-war era. Millions are not on the roll.\nThere is a need for an urgent electoral modernisation programme to address this. Again, academic studies are instructive. Mechanisms that could work include: a “motor voter” law that registers citizens when they access other government services, better funding for electoral officials, civil society actors to promote voter engagement, later registration deadlines, and easier voting procedures.",

Given the government’s decision to delay the final implementation, there are likely to be fewer new people registering this time round, and the overall effect will be fewer electors. Voluntary registration does not lead to high registration levels.\n• The government’s decision to delay the final implementation of IER is welcome news for the 3 million young people who are not registered.

        "prompt": "Overstepping the Line Between Big Data and Big Brother?\nWe keep hearing about data’s value. Data is the new oil, we’re told, valuable not just for business insight, but for actually driving new revenue growth in its own right.\nBut you know what Biggie said: Mo’ money, mo’ problems.\nThe more businesses try to monetize data, the more problems they will encounter, experts are warning.\nAnne Buff, an evangelist in the SAS Best Practices organization, argues that data is an ethical land mine for companies integrating social data and other Big Data with internal master data in the hopes that it will illuminate customers in new ways.\nWhile data is ethically neutral, the use of data is not, she writes. That’s particularly worrying since we have few regulations or rules about how to use this new breed of external data.\nTraditionally, external data sets such as customer lists and financial data are acquired under contracts, from specific service providers, and with strict usage guidelines.\nThat’s not the case with many Big Data sets, particularly the kind companies collect and integrate on their own. That doesn’t mean you can use that data any way you want without repercussions",
        "baseline": ", however.\nBuff isn’t the only one sounding the warning. Big Data company Revolution Analytics recently surveyed 865 statisticians and data scientists in the U.S. and Canada. Eighty-eight percent said consumers should be worried about data privacy.\nA clear majority, 80 percent, said there should be an ethical framework in place for collecting and using data. The results actually varied by industry, with 92 percent in the life scientists/health care industry agreeing that an ethical framework is needed compared to 76 percent in the education industry.\nFortunately, more than half of data scientists and statisticians say they’re already using an ethical framework as part of their work with data.\nSpecify your core organizational values, and be transparent about them in all communications.\nAssess and keep on top of the values of your customers.\nRegularly audit your data handling processes to ensure your actions and values align.\nCommunicate these values internally, and externally to your customers.",

It can be used to help businesses, but it can also be used to harm businesses. It can be used to help society, but it can also be used to harm society.”\nThe problem is that companies are often not aware of the ethical implications of their data use, Buff writes. They may not even be aware of the data they’re collecting, or how it’s being used.\n“Companies are not always aware of the data they are collecting, and they are not always aware of the data they are using,” she writes. “They are not always aware of the data they are sharing, and they are not always aware of the data they are selling.”\nThat’s a problem, because the more data you collect, the more you’re likely to be collecting data that you don’t need, or that you don’t know how",

Let’s say you’re a bank and you’re trying to understand your customers’ spending habits. Zillow, a real estate data company, has a database of home values. So you integrate that data with your own, and you find that your customers are spending more than they can afford on their homes. Using that data, you can deny them a loan.\nThat’s a pretty extreme example, but it’s not hard to imagine how data could be used to harm customers in other ways.

So they use data from the customer’s Facebook page to determine the color of the product they will be presented. That’s fine, right? Not exactly, says Buff.\nIf a customer has been tagged in a photo where the color of the product is red, and the customer has been tagged in a photo where the color of the product is blue, and the customer has been tagged in a photo where the color of the product is pink, and the customer has been tagged in a photo where the color of the product is white, and the customer has been tagged in a photo where the color of the product is",

        "prompt": "Did later Christians change what the earliest followers of Jesus believed about him?\nWhy do an overwhelming number of Christians believe (or say they believe) things about Jesus that were not believed by his earliest followers in Jerusalem, led by his brother James?\nThis important question results from the previous Q and A item, which summarized central teaching about Jesus Christ that has united most Christians since it was finalized by 5th Century ecumenical councils. It holds that the one true God exists in a Trinity of three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that Jesus the Son has two natures, fully human yet fully divine. Myriad worshipers over centuries have professed each week that Jesus Christ is of one “being” or “substance” with God the Father.\nHowever, in modern times the traditional teaching has been challenged in differing ways by secular thinkers, Protestant liberals, Unitarians, Latter-day Saints (“Mormons”), Jehovah’s Witnesses, certain Pentecostalists and, of course, by religions totally outside the Christian orbit like Judaism and Islam.\nThe Religion Guy confesses he has not read the hefty books that discuss this and relies upon secondary materials from the experts. This answer bypasses numerous technicalities; if interested, you can research why early church councils rejected the teaching of the Apollinarians, Arians, Docetists, Ebionites, Eutychians, Gnostics, Sabellians and the rest. Note that the question raises only the divinity of Jesus the Son, not of the Holy Spirit, and only what the earliest Christians believed, not how Jesus thought of himself.\nAbout James. He was one of Jesus’ four \"brothers\" (Mark 6:3) and a skeptic turned believer who, yes, led the original church in Jerusalem. The Sanhedrin accused James of violating Jewish law and he was executed in A.D. 62. He’s traditionally seen as the writer of the New Testament’s letter of James, though other options have been proposed.\nWith that ground cleared, on to Norman’s theme. Obviously the councils used terms like “Trinity” not found as such in the New Testament as they sought to put into words a concept beyond comprehension -- Jesus as both human and divine. So, did the councils change original Christianity? Or were they faithful to what 1st Century Christians believed and only defined the full implications?\nNorman echoes the liberal outlook proclaimed especially by Germany’s Wilhelm Bousset (1865-1920) in his influential 1913 tome “Kyrios Christos,” a high point of his \"religionsgeschichtliche schule\" (history of religions school). In essence, Bousset contended that Palestinian Jews would have believed so strictly in the one God that they couldn’t have viewed the human Jesus as divine. Therefore, such belief must have infiltrated from pagan Greek culture. Click here (.pdf) for agood academic rundown on that.\nMore recently, a group of scholars led by Larry W. Hurtado of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, is challenging Bousset. Hurtado’s quarter-century of research culminated in his tour de force “Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity” (2003). He boils down major points for non-academic readers in “How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?: Historical Questions about Earliest Devotion to Jesus” (2005) and in this 2010 paper (.pdf here).\nB",

Hurtado considers it possible this occurred among devout Jews even before the apostle Paul’s dramatic conversion in A.D. 36 some three years after Jesus was crucified (dates per Jack Finegan, Pacific School of Religion). Hurtado’s special contribution assesses non-biblical materials and what’s known about the original Christians’ “unprecedented devotional practices” that signified he was worthy of the worship due God alone.\nBut inevitably the best 1st Century sources are in the New Testament, Paul’s letters from A.D. 51 onward, followed by the other letters and the four Gospels.\nContinue reading \"Did later Christians change what Jesus’ earliest followers believed about him?\", by Richard Ostling.\nNewer PostSame as it ever was: Is Donald Trump beating the pope and winning GOP 'Catholic' voters?",

The Guy’s own view is that the earliest Christians did not have a fully developed theology of Jesus’ divinity, but they did believe he was divine. The councils were not changing what the earliest Christians believed, but were defining the implications of that belief.\nThe Guy’s bottom line: The earliest Christians believed Jesus was divine, and the councils were faithful to that belief.",

Such an honorific title was used only for God in the Old Testament, not for humans. “So it’s very hard to say that the earliest Christians really did have a very sharp distinction between the one God and Jesus that would really be incompatible with affirming that the latter was divine,” Hurtado said in an interview.\nHurt",

        "prompt": "Above: Ian Dallas, head of Giant Sparrow, showing off What Remains of Edith Finch at PSX.\nIan Dallas has a knack for coming up with weird but creative stories for video games. His first game, The Unfinished Swan, was one of my favorites of 2012. Now, his Giant Sparrow studio is working on an equally bizarre game called What Remains of Edith Finch.\nIt is a haunting tale about a cursed family in the state of Washington, and how each member of the family dies. It takes place across generations, but each tale involves something to do with the Finch home. Dallas told me about the game’s ongoing development at the PlayStation Experience event in San Francisco last weekend. With The Unfinished Swan, his team didn’t figure out the ending until late in the process. This time, he isn’t even trying to create the ending until he is further along with the stories of each family member.\nWhile some bigger games have to be written in stone before production begins, Giant Sparrow’s team is smaller and it is able to be more flexible in its creativity. Dallas freely admits that he doesn’t know the destination, even though he is pretty far down the road in building the game. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.\nIan Dallas: It’s a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington state. Each story is about a different family member and how they die.\nGamesBeat: And you got the idea how, again?\nDallas: It came from weird fiction, is the primary source. People like H. P. Lovecraft, Lord Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood. Mostly short stories about surreal, supernatural events. Also a healthy amount of the Twilight Zone and guys like Luis Bunuel — Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, movies like that.\nActually, the original inspiration was what it feels like to be underwater. I started scuba diving in the Pacific northwest. The feeling I had seeing the ocean slope away, not being able to see where it goes, feeling like you’re so far out of your depth, this tiny little insignificant speck. Trying to make a game that was about the sublime, but in a slightly terrifying position. In a very large nutshell, that’s it.\nGamesBeat: What genre would you put it in?\nDallas: Sublime horror? If I could make a genre, that’d be the one. Something that hopefully speaks to the bizarre and cold beauty of the universe. Lovecraft talks about that a lot, but it’s really hard to do that with Lovecraft now, because everything is so much about tentacles. It’s become very set. So it’s trying to make something that still feels like it has a lot of unknowns in it.\nA lot of the value in what we do comes from how it’s something out on the periphery. It’s unusual. That’s an important value, an important part of what we’re doing, so everything is optimized around trying to keep the process pretty flexible. There’s a window. Like in Indiana Jones, the door that’s coming down?\nIt’s a funny situation, where the farther you get into development, the more you know about the game, and the better your tools are for enacting your changes. But you have less time to make changes and those changes can be more costly. It’s almost like Cassandra. In Unfinished Swan, we knew the game was a bit too long for players. We had a fix. We’d just take part of the city, get rid of it, and then smoosh these two areas together. But there wasn’t time to enact it.\nGamesBeat: I went to Pixar once and saw how it made movies. In contrast to video games, their filmmakers script everything out frame-by-frame. By the time they give it to the artists to start the rendering work, they can’t make any changes. They did make a few changes in Monsters University, where they changed the villain from a male to a female, and it apparently cost them an ungodly amount of money. Yet they’re known as so creative. It’s an interesting contrast.\nFor us one of the things we’ve tried to do as we’ve grown the team — we’re up to 16 people now – there’s a lot of work that has to be scheduled every week. We try to have parts of the game that are more well-understood, especially the art investment — that’s a part you can never get back. If someone models a record player and you’re like, “No, we’ll set the story 50 years earlier, before that was invented,” there’s no used for that model anymore. It’s just lost work. With programming there’s a bit more re-use.\nHaving the house has been a nice safe haven to soak up work. When there are times where design doesn’t really know what to do, or we’re making something that we think might change, we can throw artists at making bedrooms. We can split the tasks up and move people around.\nAbove: The Finch house in What Remains of Edith Finch.\nGamesBeat: This is a very modular design, it seems. You have one character, another character, and another character. Can you do the stories in a serial way?\nDallas: That was one of the reasons we initially set it up as a series of short stories, stories about a family. The feeling was that we could toss things off the back of the bus, if needed, to lighten the load. That’s still kind of true. But we’re now at a point where we have such a large family, with all these interconnections, that removing one piece — it’s not impossible. We’ve cut story recently. But it requires some deft changes to suture the wound.\nIn the end there are places where we’ve cut things and the game is better for it. Things fit in ways that weren’t obvious in the beginning. It’s a weird paradox. As you go farther into development you’re able to make these sweeping cuts and changes that make the game better, because you know so much more about the game is. It’s like being a surgeon. You know the cuts you can make that will help the patient. Earlier on you’re just fumbling around and you’re as likely to kill the patient as save them.\nGamesBeat: On a lot of games, people start preproduction and do a lot of early prototyping. They seem to cut that off around six months in and then they know what they’re going to do. That doesn’t seem to work for you.\nDallas: Yeah. There are days where I wish we’d just added a couple of years where we were still three or four people. But it works okay for us. What’s interesting about the games we make is that they do have a large team associated with them, so we can make things that have a sense of grandeur to them. You wouldn’t be able to do that with just a couple of people.\nThe balance we’ve found for this game is to have stories that are in rolling development. One story will be a super early prototype. The artists and tech artists will be involved for a few days making some prototype stuff, because it helps us understand the story to have a few things arted out. But then the rest of the team is on stories that are more well-defined. Of course, the problem is that if design lags a bit, you get this logjam of people waiting for work that’s not set yet. That’s where we try to do more stuff in-house and balance it there. But the stories are little prototypes in various phases, going right up to the end.\nThat’s partly intentional, based on the experience of Unfinished Swan. We didn’",
        "baseline": "t really have an ending for that game until a few months before we were meant to be done with it. I think the game was better for that. Like I keep saying, the farther you are in development, the more you know what it feels like to play the game, to have the experience of seeing all of these sequence—you know where people are mentally and what they’re concerned about. In Swan we were able to create an ending that played into where people were. We were working with the grain.\nIn the beginning, for me—I think I know where I’m going to go, but I’m so wrong. For this game we didn’t even really try. We had some ideas for where the ending would go, but that’s something we’ve deliberately postponed so we can make something that feels like it nicely wraps up, or doesn’t, all the various threads we’ve created earlier on.",

        "prompt": "Usain Bolt, the global track star from Jamaica, ran his last 100m dash on Saturday at the 2017 world championships, concluding a record-breaking career that spanned three Olympic Games. Christopher Clarey of The New York Times joins Hari Sreenivasan to recap Bolt’s achievements and discuss what his retirement -- if it sticks -- would mean for the sport.\nThe last 100-meter race of his career did not go as planned for Usain Bolt. He came in third place at the world championships in London, losing to two Americans, Justin Gatlin who took the gold and Chris Coleman who took the silver. Bolt, still the world record holder, said this would be his last competition.\nFor more context about the Bolt effect, earlier I spoke with Christopher Clarey of \"The New York Times\" who joined me via Skype from London.\nChris, is it possible to overestimate the as a matter of impact of Usain Bolt on track and field and sports?\nYou know, he has been the face and the soul of the sport for almost a decade now, and it's extraordinary. It really is. He has been the one global figure that they've had, and also he's been pretty good news for the sport, instead of a lot of bad news. So, definitely, a seminal figure.\nIt's a bit like Michael Phelps is to swimming, or Tiger Woods as to golf. When you think of track and field, you have that, you know, million watts smile and the guy doing the lightning bolt dance at the end of his races.\nNo, it's true. He and Phelps are a good comparison. I mean, they've just been the kings of their sports in the same period of time. They kind of broke through in Beijing and dominated that Olympics at the same time. Very similar. Dominant figures, huge appetite for success, and really enduring.\nYou know, even if track and field — as track and field had these sort of repeated, high-profile doping incidents, Usain Bolt was able to just kind of glide above it all, winning match — or meet after meet.\nIn a way, that's been maybe his greatest accomplishment in some way, greatest act he's pulled up in a sense that he's been able to really remain above that fray. It's been quite a fray. A lot of scandals in track and field, a lot of credibility crises, and Bolt really has been able to stay above that.\nThere have been things that have affected him. He's lost a medal in the relay because one of his teammates was involved in a doping infraction. There have been, you know, fellow Jamaicans who tested positive for banned substances as well, including Asafa Powell. But Usain has never tested positive, never been sanctioned. So, that's a bit of good news for the sport.\nIs there a reason he chose to retire now? I mean, you can see that his times have been slowing, and — but this is a guy who loves the competition, who loves to get in there and win. I mean, I don't think, at least in the interviews that I've read, I don't think he particularly likes to train and put the work in, but he does it because he loves to win.\nI think that's it. I think that's — you put your finger on it. I mean, he's had injury problems throughout his career. He's got to come in to major championships for the last five years fighting injuries almost every time. So, I think he's tired of that.\nAnd, really, I mean, he did a great documentary last year which was a lot of fun to watch called \"I Am Bolt,\" and you can see him complaining about the training in almost every scene. I mean, I think he really enjoys the competition, enjoys that magnetic moment when he's out there and the crowd is communing with him and racing and beating everybody.\nBut when it comes to the day-to-day drudgery of being a sprinter, I think he would be happy to leave that behind, and I think, also, he's really done all there is to do in this sport.\nAnd this is a guy, when you look at him, he doesn't look like a sprinter that has been the archetype that we've had, especially in the 100 meters. This short, super, stocky, muscular guys that explode out of the blocks. He's literally, at times a foot taller than his competition.\nYes, it's true. When he lines up to race and get in a set position, you can see he's already higher than everybody else even with his head down. He's a much taller person, about 6'5″.\nYou look back in the past of track and field, Carl Lewis obviously wasn't as tall as Usain, but he was the same sort of — same sort of lines. You know, a tall — a tall sprinter by those standards of that day. And I think now what Bolt has really done is being able to combine the two of being a tall sprinter but he also has a very quick turnover, able to explode off the track and really produce tremendous power in each of his strides. And also, he has long strides so he's able to cover the whole race, 100 meters in about 41 strides whereas a lot of his competitors are 44, 45, 46. So, that's all been a big factor and many will try to replicate it in the years to come.\nDo you ever wonder what that world record time could have been in Beijing or other places where it almost seemed like in the last 10 meters, he's looking up at the big screen, and he's almost coast",
        "baseline": "ing in? I mean, there wasn't anybody just kind of breathing down his neck, and if he'd just given us that last extra 10 percent.\nYes, you're right. I mean, that was the first breakthrough globally at the Beijing Olympics when he did let up in the 100 when he got to the finish line.\nBut a year later in Berlin, when he set the world record that still exist, 9.58 seconds, he ran through the tape, and you saw what happened, a world record. But he's been unable to touch, maybe nobody will touch for many, many years to come. And he himself was quite young at the time, we figured he'd be able to go on, maybe get into the 9.4s, never did for a variety of reasons, but he did run through the tape and that record is there to prove it.\nAll right.

I mean, he's been so smooth and so fast that you really wonder where the limit is.\nAnd I mean, he's been able to recover from injuries and come in and win major championships and win Olympic gold medals.

        "prompt": "In the course of the 20th century, a resident of the city now known as Lviv would have lived in five different countries without ever leaving home. Before World War I, the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was known by the German name Lemberg. After Austria’s defeat in 1918, it was part of the territory awarded to the newly created state of Poland and began to go by its Polish name, Lvov. During WWII, Lvov was occupied by the Nazis, who incorporated it into the province they called the General Government. After three years—during which the city’s Jewish population of some 150,000 was annihilated—Lvov was liberated by the Red Army but it was not returned to Poland. Rather, it was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and almost the entire Polish population was transferred hundreds of miles to the west, to areas that Poland had annexed from Germany. Finally, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the city became part of an independent Ukraine, under the name of Lviv.\na peach. It is everywhere.\nZagajewski, now in his 70s, is widely considered the leading Polish poet of his generation—the generation after the one that included titans like Czeslaw Milosz and Wislawa Szymborska. He has always written prose as well as verse, and his new book, Slight Exaggeration, is a hybrid of diary, criticism, and aphorism—a depository for the poet’s observations and ruminations over a period of several years. While “To Go to Lvov” is now decades old—and the emigration from Lvov itself took place more than 70 years ago, before his own birth—in this book (translated from the Polish by Clare Cavanagh) Zagajewski’s thoughts return again and again to the place and its inhabitants.\nPolish emigres from Lvov, the people he was raised among, were dedicated to the past: “guardians of memory” who “lived on, ever older, in poorer health, more hunched, more forgetful … with ever greater suffering,” yet determined to “discreetly control the state of knowledge about the City for as long as possible.” The poet was infected at birth, as it were, with this dreamy longing for a place he never actually knew. Yet he points out that “To Go to Lvov,” for all its popularity among the emigres, also aroused their suspicion. After all, “didn’t the very fact of speaking about the lost City, speaking in verse, with poetic enthusiasm, place the author beyond the pale of the dispossessed?” Perhaps it was only because Zagajewski was not from Lvov that he could praise it so vividly; the actual “dispossessed” were too defensive of their memories, too gloomy in their nostalgia, to turn Lvov into art.\nThere is an element of fastidiousness in this aesthetic faith, a shrinking from what Zagajewski sometimes perceives as the banality and vulgarity of ordinary people’s pursuits. (Rock music comes in for some disdain in the book, as do cell phones.) But at the same time, Zagajewski is aware that his own enthusiasm is vulnerable to irony and skepticism. “I don’t know how my fellow poets live, but I know perfectly well that I don’t usually believe in my own poems,” he writes, suggesting that the kind of aesthetic rapture that provokes poetry is short-lived, and hard to recapture after the fact.\nThat is one reason why",
        "baseline": " he admires genuine mystics, in whose number he includes figures as different as D.H. Lawrence and Simone Weil. Another of Zagajewski’s well-known poems is titled “Mysticism for Beginners,” in which the title of a pop spirituality book, glimpsed at a café, becomes a motto for a way of life: the world in all its beauty exists in order to provoke us into a sense of its miraculousness, its strangeness. Poetry is the genre Zagajewski uses to capture those moments of insight. His prose, more relaxed, urbane, and various, chronicles moments of less intensity, but still opulent, dedicated to travel and music, thought and art. It is an existence luxurious in some ways, rigorous and exigent in others—as we would all like our lives to be.\nApril is National Poetry Month.

        "prompt": "Salvador President Jose Napoleon Duarte's reappointment of Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova as defense minister is viewed with a mixed reaction in Washington.\nCritics of Duarte's decision worry that Vides Casanova's presence will weaken the new President's ability to purge the Army of officers involved with death squads.\nThe group that expresses this concern is composed of moderates and liberals - some United States congressmen, their staff people, and others - who met regularly this spring with Salvadorean military chief of staff Col. Adolfo Onecifero Blandon and other military officers to get the military to clean house. This group is convinced that Vides Casanova was one of the most important members of the military leadership that approved of the organization and activities of death squads.\nThe ranks of the critics grew last month when the Reagan administration declassified a report on an investigation into the 1981 killings of four US churchwomen in El Salvador. Liberal Democratic Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio was one of those who strongly criticized the Vides Casanova reappointment after reading the report, which stated that it is very possible Vides Casanova covered up the murder of the churchwomen.\nOthers congressmen - mostly political conservatives - support Duarte's decision to keep Vides Casanova.\n''We have to give Duarte some room to work with,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde (R) of Illinois, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''If Duarte has reappointed Vides Casanova, it is because he knows better than most what it would take to get the support of the military, and I'm not prepared to condemn that.\n''He needs to take the necessary steps to co-opt the military. From my vantage point, I think that Duarte has good chances to clean up the military. I think intelligent people in the Salvadoran military understand that they have to make the Duarte government work,'' Representative Hyde said in an interview.\nA Republican Senate staffer stresses privately that Vides Casanova, unlike Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, his predecessor as defense minister, is regarded as a man of principle in his personal life, not corrupt like many of his fellow officers, and a family man. He called the defense minister ''one of the few beacons of stability they (the Salvadorean military) have left,'' noting that the Army has already undergone considerable change in the last few years.\nAnother who has criticized the Vides Casanova reappointment is moderate Salvadorean exile Leonel Gomez, who is a member of the Washington group of critics concerned about Salvadorean death squads.\nGomez, who regularly criticizes both Salvador's guerrillas and its government , says Defense Minister Vides Casanova ''was more responsible than many others'' in the Salvadorean military for death squad activity.\nIf Vides Casanova is left in power, Gomez says, the psychological message sent to the Salvadorean armed forces power structure will be ''",

The assistant director of the Salvadorean Land Reform Institute, he fled his country fearing for his life after institute director Rudolfo Vieras was assassinated in 1981.\nGomez also says President Reagan sent the wrong psychological message to El Salvador in his May 9 television speech on Central America, when he stated that there are violent right-wing extremists in El Salvador but that they are not part of the government.\nSeveral Republican and Democrat congressional staffers also have deplored that statement in the President's speech. They said it had the effect of telling the Salvadorean military high command that the Reagan administration is unaware of ''basic Salvadorean realities,'' and is willing to ignore the degree to which the Salvadorean Army was involved in the killings. Such a US attitude, these staffers say, gives little incentive to either Duarte or the Salvadorean military to clean house.",

Oakar is convinced that Vides Casanova was involved in covering up the murder of the four US churchwomen. She is also convinced that the report on the churchwomen's murders, which was written by the US Embassy in San Salvador, was deliberately diluted by the Reagan administration to avoid embarrassing the military.\n''I think the report was watered down and the administration is trying to protect the military,'' said Rep. Oakar after the report was declassified. ''The report says that it is very possible that the defense minister and the chief of staff were involved in covering up the murders. I think that is the most important statement in the report.''\nThe report, which was written by the US Embassy in San Salvador, was declassified after the Reagan administration was forced to do so by a court order resulting from a lawsuit filed by the church",

Even though the US has been ''very tough'' on the Salvadorean guerrillas, the staffer says, it has not been tough enough on the military.\n''The US has to be more forceful with the military,'' the staffer says.

Garcia as the new ambassador to the United Nations as a ''reward'' for his role in death squad activity, he says he shares Gomez's view that Vides Casanova's reappointment is a step backward.\n''I think it is very important that the military move away from the death squads to the point where they are not even tolerated,'' the congressman says. Mr. Gomez says he shares the view of many Salvadorean military officers that it is important to get rid of the death squads because the leftist guerrillas are using them as a propaganda tool.\n''The death squads are the most important propaganda arm of the guerrillas,'' Gomez says in a telephone interview from",

        "prompt": "The live-capture stage-to-screen season at the Amherst Cinema has begun, with a lineup of adaptations of world classics from the London stage – a dance-happy movie musical, a steamy exploration of transgressive desire, a surreal whodunnit, a Gothic horror story – plus a modern-dress Shakespeare. Most come courtesy of the ongoing National Theatre Live series. Here they are, in upcoming order.\nSept. 29, 12:30pm — The Broadway and West End hit musical An American in Paris was “inspired by” the 1951 MGM movie, which itself was inspired by George Gershwin’s jazzy 1928 orchestral piece. The musical premiered, appropriately enough, in Paris, in 2014, then moved to New York and thence to London, where this enchanting production was recorded.\nCraig Lucas’s adaptation, staged by Christopher Wheeldon and starring the two original leads, Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, adds some plot and extra characters while showcasing a dozen classic Gershwin tunes, including the iconic title number – not danced all over Paris as Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron did in the movie, but reinvented as a balletic dream sequence. And the dancing hardly ever stops. If someone breaks into song it’s sure to blossom into a production number (“Stairway to Paradise” begins in a small jazz club and morphs into Radio City Music Hall, complete with Rockettes).\nThe action moves cinematically through numerous locations, from the streets of Paris (there’s a fabulous dance prelude celebrating the war’s end, set to Gershwin’s Concerto in F) to bars and nightclubs, galleries and Seine-side parapets, accomplished with rolling set pieces and ingenious projections.\nThe venue is shifted from rural Sweden to a deluxe London townhouse where a wild party is going on above the basement kitchen. Julie, giddy with drink and self-pity, plays at friendship with her maid, Kristina, and performs a dangerous pas de deux with her father’s chauffeur, Jean, who has brains and ambitions above his station.\nAs Julie, Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in The Crown) is every bit as willful, impulsive, needy and self-absorbed as Strindberg’s anti-heroine – to which she adds a few lines of cocaine. Kristina and Jean are both black, adding race to the play’s roiling cauldron of class and gender roles. Thalissa Teixeira and Eric Kofi Abrefa are both captivating, she proud beneath the weight of subservience, he wary but longing as he circles into Julie’s tantalizing orbit.\nOctober 8 — The Curious Incident of the Dog",

        "prompt": "On November 2, 1917, the British government expressed its sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations and announced that it would use its “best endeavors” to facilitate “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” The announcement came in a letter from Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, the unofficial leader of the British Jewish community. The Balfour declaration became the diplomatic foundation stone of the state of Israel; it is considered the original sin by Israel’s opponents.\nIn this comprehensive study, richly documented by diplomatic correspondence, Jonathan Schneer concludes that the famous declaration seems to have just missed the sidetrack of history: in contrast to a common myth, Britain’s support for Zionism was not the result of an inevitable process. In fact, as Schneer reveals, shortly after Balfour’s promise to the Jews, the British government offered the Ottoman Empire the opportunity to keep Palestine and to continue to fly the Turkish flag over it.\nChaim Weizmann, the leading spokesman for Zionism in Britain, must have felt ill at ease when he entered those awesome corridors of power. A Russian-born chemist, he began to solicit support among the British soon after he settled in Manchester in 1904. He could hardly speak English in those days: his first contacts with British officials were conducted in French. But if he was taken aback by the snobbery and coolness that awaited him at Whitehall, he made sure to conceal his uneasiness, acting as if he commanded an almost omnipotent power: world Jewry. The British believed he did.\nObviously there was no “Jewish power” controlling world affairs, but Weizmann successfully pretended that the Jews were in fact turning the wheels of history. For once, the anti-Semitic image of the Jews proved useful — they were believed to be so maliciously dangerous that one would do best to acquire them as allies rather than as enemies.\nBut fear of the Jews was only one part of the story. The other part, which Schneer neglects to explore, was the genuine admiration many of Britain’s leaders, including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Balfour himself, felt for the Jews and their history. These men were deeply religious Christian Zionists. They had grown up on the Bible; the Holy Land was their spiritual home. Modern Zionism, they believed, would fulfill a divine promise and resettle the Jews in the land of their ancient fathers.\nAs part of this context, Schneer expertly analyzes the passionate and fascinating controversy between non-Zionist and Zionist Jews that preceded the Balfour declaration. The Zionists spoke in the name of Jewish nationhood; their Jewish opponents denied that Jews even constituted a separate nation.\nAccording to Schneer, the Arabs were as invisible to the early Zionists as Africans had been to Boers in South Africa, or Indians to the French and English colonists in North America. But in fact, some of the first Zionists were well aware of the Arabs’ vehement objection to their national aspirations. As early as 1899, Theodore Herzl himself, the father of political Zionism, corresponded with the Arab mayor of Jerusalem, Yusuf Dia al-Khalidi, who urged him to find a national home for the Jews somewhere else in the world. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have had its origins at the very beginning of Zionism.\nMany of the British diplomatic papers Schneer examines were brilliantly written. At times it seems that these dispatches and reports, rather than analyses of foreign policy, were the exercises of frustrated poets and writers, educated at Eton and Oxford, who hoped for posterity in the Public Record Office. Much of what they wrote led nowhere, though Schneer elaborates on their maneuvers at great length.\nHe details, for instance, the correspondence between British officials and the Arabs, as well as a secret diplomatic scheme of 1916 known as the “Sykes-­Picot Agreement,” which would have partitioned much of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine, between Britain and France. These initiatives have little significance today, except perhaps with regard to the Arab contention that the British had promised Palestine to the Arabs before they promised it to the Jews. Schneer suggests that the promises given to the Arabs were too vague and contradictory to evaluate. Still, the way he reveals the characters behind the diplomatic papers, bringing them to life, makes his book particularly enjoyable.\nTake Britain’s magnificent, if abortive, effort to detach the Ottoman Empire from the Central Powers. The idea was to orchestrate what would today be called regime change in Turkey. The new rulers would then make a separate peace with Britain, retain Palestine and get a handsome bribe for themselves — millions of American dollars.

For at least two decades they allowed the Zionist movement to bring hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants into Palestine, and these new arrivals set up hundreds of settlements including several towns, as well as the political, economic, military and cultural infrastructure of the future state of Israel. But if Israel’s existence originated with the British, so did the Palestinians’ tragedy.

But he was also a friend of Weizmann’s, and he was willing to help him. He was, in fact, the only British official who was willing to help Weizmann.\nZohrab’s plan was to persuade the Ottoman government to make a separate peace with Britain. In return, Britain would give the Turks a large sum of money and allow them to keep Palestine. The Turks would then be able to expel the Jews from Palestine.

        "prompt": "When you�re a U.S. Congressman and 25,000 constituent families can�t find affordable heating oil this winter, you tend not to care where help comes from. That�s at least how U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia felt last week when Citgo  the U.S.-based company owned by the government of Venezuela�s left-wing President Hugo Chavez  delivered 5 million gallons of heating oil at a 40% discount to low-income Philadelphia residents. Fattah says he doesn�t understand the objections of many congressional conservatives who feel U.S. cities should not be helping improve the image of Chavez, one of President Bush�s most strident critics. \"The U.S. buys 1.5 million barrels of oil from Venezuela each day at full price,\" says Fattah, \"so why would anyone complain about getting some at almost half price?\"\nThat�s a question the Bush Administration  whose feelings for Chavez are certainly mutual  has struggled to answer ever since Venezuela initiated the Citgo program last November. While the heating oil gesture has certainly allowed Chavez to tweak Bush�s nose, it is also being recognized inside and outside of Washington as a public relations coup for Chavez�s Bolivarian Revolution (named for South America�s 19th-century independence hero, Simon Bolivar).\nAs a result, it�s growing well beyond its original scope: Philadelphia, Boston, the Bronx and cities in Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island have received a total of 45 million gallons of the subsidized Citgo fuel, and other cities are slated for another 5 million soon. That�s a small percentage of the heating oil Venezuela exports to the U.S. each year, but Citgo says it has set aside about 10% of its refined petroleum products for the program. Says Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington, D.C., \"Unfortunately for the Bush Administration, Chavez is proving to be a more inventive thinker in terms of hemispheric politics.\"\nIt�s also good business thinking, says Venezuela�s Ambassador to the U.S., Bernardo Alvarez, one of the program�s architects. When 13 U.S. Senators sent a letter to major U.S. oil companies last fall seeking heating fuel aid for lower-income residents in northern states, Citgo  a subsidiary of the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)  was the only one to step forward. \"The U.S. is our biggest [oil export] customer,\" says Alvarez. \"PDVSA is simply responding to that client the way any company should.\"\nCritics suggest Chavez�s oil diplomacy is simply a ploy to take consumers� minds off of record high oil prices, which are partly a result of his efforts to rebuild the power of OPEC, of which Venezuela is a founding member. Alvarez insists crude prices in the 1990s were \"unfairly low\" for producers like Venezuela  but says the Citgo program does give Chavez a chance to showcase \"one of our revolution�s most important principles: the redistribution of oil revenues, especially for the poor.\" He adds it also reflects \"the kind of cooperation mechanism we�re using with our neighbor countries in Latin America.\" Many of them  especially Cuba, whose communist leader Fidel Castro is one of Chavez�s closest allies  get cheaper access to Venezuelan crude as part of Chavez�s campaign to forge greater Latin American integration and less economic reliance on the U.S. Last Friday, in a move that further irritated the U.S., Chavez was awarded the United Nations' Jose Marti prize for promoting Latin American unity.\nBut the heating oil project�s biggest diplomatic coup, Alvarez concedes, may be the good will it generates among Americans at a time of deteriorating U.S.-Venezuela relations  strained ever since the Bush Administration was widely accused of backing a failed 2002 coup against Chavez (a charge it denies).

(Citgo, Chavez aides point out, is also a NASCAR sponsor.) \"We�ll continue to support a people whose government is hostile to us,\" says Alvarez. \"We have nothing against this country.\" Venezuelans and Americans might feel that way, but for the moment it seems that no amount of heating oil, no matter how deeply discounted, could thaw the enmity between their two governments.",

        "prompt": "On Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the federal death penalty.\nThere was little surprise in a federal jury voting death for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and little ground for sympathy in the record of the defendant himself, beyond his sheer youth. While the evidence presented at trial seemed to confirm the picture of his enraged older brother Tamerlan as the radicalized instigator of their brutal plot, Dzhokhar’s protracted role ahead of time and his stone-cold activities in the hours following the bombing (for example, calmly cruising the dairy aisle at Whole Foods) are not the material from which a strong mitigation case is made.\nBut while perhaps inevitable, Tsarnaev’s federal death sentence is still profoundly unsettling. He was sentenced to death in a state that abolished capital punishment 31 years ago; in a city whose residents had overwhelmingly preferred that he be imprisoned for life; and in a courtroom in which sat survivors and victims’ family members who were themselves deeply divided over his fate. What does it mean when a killer is sentenced to die by lethal injection against the wishes of the very community he injured? What is the purpose of a federal prosecution imposing capital punishment on a region that wants none of it, at a moment when the death penalty has been abandoned by more than one-third of all states?\nState death-penalty law, for better or worse, is usually a deep reflection of local history, culture, and debate. That’s true in the states that still routinely execute prisoners, like Texas and Oklahoma, as well as in the nine states that have abolished capital punishment since 1980, like Massachusetts.\nToday’s federal death penalty—a calculated political invention of then-president Bill Clinton—is a different story. Until 20 years ago, capital punishment on the federal level was limited to treason and a handful of other offenses not covered by state law. But in 1994, the Clinton administration—responding to the first World Trade Center bombing and hoping to burnish its tough-on-crime credentials—radically expanded capital punishment, writing 60 new death-penalty offenses, including several related to terrorism, into a sweeping criminal-justice “reform” package.\nIt didn’t do much good; seven months after the Clinton crime bill was signed, Timothy McVeigh and two co-conspirators bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. So the next year, Clinton and Congress went even further, passing the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. This package—one of the most deceptively labeled bills of all time—limited habeas corpus and weakened the protections offered to state and federal death-row prisoners, most of whom had nothing to do with terrorism.\nFar from reflecting a social consensus, these changes were designed to inoculate Clinton and his allies in the country’s most ardently pro-execution regions and to resell capital punishment to states that had rejected it. US Attorneys could push capital trials into non-death-penalty jurisdictions, occasionally leading to notable conflicts. In 2011, for instance, federal prosecutors in Rhode Island—a state without capital punishment since the 1980s—insisted on pursuing the death penalty against a gas-station robber who would otherwise have been sentenced in the state’s criminal courts. Then-governor Lincoln Chafee was so incensed at this imposition that he committed a singular act of civil disobedience: For almost two years, he refused to hand the offender over to the feds. The dispute was settled only when the robber pleaded guilty in return for life without parole.\nAs a deterrent to terrorism, the federal death penalty has been meaningless. It did nothing to prevent the Oklahoma City bombing, the 9/11 attacks, or ideologically motivated lone wolves like Nidal Malik Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter, or the Tsarnaevs. Meanwhile, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other 9/11 conspirators will not be tried under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, since the same politicians who clamor for the death penalty as a deterrent to terrorists are unwilling to entrust Guantánamo prisoners to US courts.\nWhether the federal government will even have a mechanism for executing Tsarnaev is now a matter of debate. The last terrorist bomber to be executed was McVeigh, killed by lethal injection in Indiana in June 2001. At his execution, news reporters noted tears streaming from one otherwise-immobile eye. Those tears caught the attention of Columbia University anesthesiologist Dr. Mark Heath, who recognized them not as a sign of emotion, but as an indication that the pain-masking sedative in the government’s three-drug cocktail was wearing off. McVeigh was still paralyzed, but now in unspeakable agony.\nFrom those tears flowed 14 years of medical-journal and law-review articles, lawsuits, and worldwide alarm about lethal injections. International pressure led drug companies to refuse to supply the cocktail’s ingredients to state corrections departments. During the Tsarnaev trial, the lethal-injection debate reached the Supreme Court, with the justices heatedly arguing over whether the use of substitute chemicals, acquired from shadowy suppliers, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\nHowever the Court rules on lethal injection, there’s no denying that the politics of crime and punishment have undergone a sea change. In a new libertarian wave, Congress, the president, and state legislatures are variously ratcheting down the “war on drugs,” reversing three-strikes laws, and trying to shutter overcrowded and expensive prisons. In 1994, Clinton Democrats played the federal death-penalty card to retain their hold in divided states. But since then, the country has continued a slow, steady march in the opposite direction. Six states, including four that today have Republican governors—New Jersey, New Mexico, Maryland, and Illinois—have renounced the death penalty. Meanwhile, three of Hillary Clinton’s rivals—Chafee, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders—oppose capital punishment. Chafee and O’Malley, who abolished the death penalty as governor, both issued statements of respect for the Boston jury’",

Sooner or later, the federal death penalty will become a Democratic campaign issue, and Clinton will be challenged on her views. It is entirely conceivable that a few years from now, support for America’s capital-punishment laws could melt away as quickly as opposition to marriage equality.\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker both expressed hope that the verdict would bring, in Baker’s words, “some kind of closure.” But there’s no evidence that capital punishment provides any such thing. For Boston, Tsarnaev’s death sentence can only prolong the agony, keeping his case front and center for years to come.

Until then, the federal government should not use it, especially not in response to a crime that arose as a result of its own policies.

When you model your problem mathematically, then you can solve it using techniques formulated to get solutions either quantitatively or qualitatively and you use that to explain what you are doing to people who are specialists in other areas. Modeling is key, anything different from that will not help the economy or help us get out of our depreciation of naira. All these things are just mathematical modeling. We need to get experts who are using this model to formulate a way out and Nigeria will be better for us.\"\n\"We need this mathematics to model real life processes taking into cognizance the important factors that determines the process. That is what has led to what we have today. We have DSTV, telecommunications, planes, internet and others. Everything is based on mathematical modeling. That is why it is important for us to encourage people right from primary school to be interested in mathematics so that this will help them to grow and get jobs for the future.\nHe continued: \" \"It is synonymous to solving word problems in secondary schools. At its foundation lies a physical problem motivated by nature under certain conditions. The physical descriptions of the problem are then converted to mathematical arguments in form of equations (such as differential or algebraic equations) called the model equations. These are solved validated against related experiments and interpreted for relevant use\".\nIn the same vein, Prof Okoya who is the first occupier of the Pastor E.A Adeboye Endowed Professorial Chair in Mathematics from 2013-",

To make students develop interest in the subject, the university teacher enjoined teachers to simplify their mode of teaching to make learning easier.\nHe also called on the government to identify and encourage pupils who have passion for the subject through scholarships and grants.\n\"Why do we have special schools if not to encourage and nurture talents? Why can't we do the same for mathematics?

        "prompt": "Heather Bowman's journey to motherhood has been far from an easy one. Closing in on 36 and still single, she decided to take a leap of faith two years ago and try to become a mother on her own. She just had no idea what a bumpy road it would be.\nBowman's first pregnancy in 2017 ended in a miscarriage early into the first trimester -- followed by the tragic loss of twins at 16 weeks.\n\"I started to have contractions,\" Bowman tells CafeMom, recalling how her second pregnancy ended. \"I had on and off bleeding and didn't know what was going on ... I had been in labor, and the babies were coming and they would not survive.\"\nShe tells CafeMom that it was an \"out of body experience\" that she couldn't quite believe.\n\"I have never felt that kind of pain, suffering, and devastation,\" she says. \"But I wasn't giving up. I asked my OB the same evening when I could start trying again!\"\nSoon after, she received some news she wasn't expecting.\nAfter some tests, doctors discovered that Bowman's fertility issues stemmed from a rare condition known as \"unicornuate uterus\" -- a uterine malformation which left her born with just half a uterus, one ovary, and a single fallopian tube.\n\"The diagnosis was frightening for me,\" Bowman tells CafeMom, \"but my reproductive endocrinologist was absolutely confident that regardless of my previous outcomes, I absolutely could carry a baby to term ... so I continued on my journey.\"\nNext came four more cycles of interuterine insemination (IUI) and then a round of IVF, until finally, Bowman learned she was once again pregnant -- with twins!\nHer excitement, however, was mixed with fear. She'd already endured the loss of twins once -- what if she lost these babies, too?\nBowman says she tried to stay positive, despite her concerns. But at 17 weeks, one of her worst fears was realized, when doctors told her they'd lost the heartbeat of her son, James.\n\"Every week I went in for my weekly ultrasounds expecting the worst and hoping for the best,\" says Bowman. \"I made small milestones for myself and tried to take things hour by hour, day by day.\"\nThough the loss of James was unbelievably heartbreaking, Bowman says the birth of Leti gave her new hope -- and the strength to carry on.\nBowman continued to carry both babies until February 12, 2019, when they were born via C-section.\n\"Hearing her cry was the biggest relief I have had in my entire life,\" she says. \"My mother was in the OR with me and kept telling me how perfect she was. She brought her over to me and I couldn't believe I was looking at the most perfect angel that ever existed.\"\nLeti had two small birthmarks on her forehead, which her mom says almost look like tiny footprints.\n\"To me they are her brother's stamp that he is watching over her, his little footprints to note that he will always be with her,\" Bowman says.\nWhen the hospital chaplain brought baby James to the recovery room a few hours later, Bowman says \"a flood of emotion\" washed over her, as well as memories of losing her first twins, whom she'd named Buchanan and Lenor (Nori).\n\"The tears were flowing,\" she says, adding that unfortunately, due to James's condition, she was unable to take photos with him.\nBut the new mom knew right away that she wanted to honor baby James's short life. She just wasn't sure at first how she'd do it.\n\"I wanted to honor him like I did with my other twins and tattoo his footprints on my wrist next to his siblings, but was unable to,\" Bowman says. \"But at the end of the day, I got to see him, touch him and say goodbye. I knew I had to grieve him again, but also focus on my beautiful daughter who I could hold in my arms.\"\nIt wasn't long before Bowman contacted photographer Jessica Young, and asked about setting up a newborn photo shoot for Leti -- which sparked an idea.\nBefore the shoot, Bowman told Young about the heartbreaking loss of James, and the story touched the photographer so deeply, she wanted to find a way to bring his memory into the session.\nWhen Bowman showed up to Young's studio on February 27, she was overcome with emotion when she saw the scene that greeted her. Next to a small wooden cradle for Leti to lay in was a matching one for James -- complete with a blue swaddle and tiny pair of angel wings carefully placed inside.\n\"I had not done anything like that before,\" Young tells CafeMom. \"I have done sessions for rainbow babies but not one honoring a lost twin.\"\nYoung says that although she knew she wanted to incorporate angel wings into the photo somehow, it wasn't until she was setting up that she began toying with the idea of weaving pink and blue swaddle blankets together to show the twins' unbreakable bond.\nThe photo has been making its way around Facebook in the weeks since Young first shared it, and it's striking a chord with people everywhere.\n\"Your portrait really conveys the loss in a touching way,\" wrote one user, while hundreds of others added just how simultaneously beautiful and heartbreaking the image is.\nBowman says she's stunned by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support she's received from strangers.\n\"I am shocked how it has been received and how viral it has gone,\" she tells CafeMom. \"What started",

Her hope, she says, is that it \"helps someone else understand that this is possible for people like me.\"\nIn the meantime, Bowman's devoted to the little ray of sunshine to come out of all this: Leti, whose middle name is James, in honor of her brother.\nBut that's not the only way she's keeping his memory alive. She's also enlarged the now-viral photo Young took and placed it in her daughter's nursery.\n\"We will always talk about him and celebrate his birthday as much as hers,\" Bowman says. \"I want her to know how much her mom wanted both her and her brother here, and how important he is to both of our lives as he is watching down over us with her other siblings.\"",

        "prompt": "Yoshihiro Uchida celebrated his 92nd birthday on Sunday.\nEven more impressive is that for 66 of his years, Uchida has been coaching judo at San Jose State University. He built the program into a national power and has almost single-handedly elevated the stature and visibility of judo in the United States.\nUchida, a Japanese-American, has also been a model of determination and has had a knack for transforming obstacles into opportunity and using an opponent’s momentum to his advantage.\nLast month Uchida watched proudly as San Jose State hosted the national collegiate judo championships and his Spartans won their 45th championship in 51 years. This summer, one of his athletes, Marti Malloy, will represent the United States at the Olympics in London.\nAs important as judo has been to Uchida, his life has been framed by other events. While he served in the United States Army during World War II, his family was sent to American internment camps. Because of his heritage, he struggled to find work after the war, but he eventually founded successful businesses. And he has never quit working or coaching.\nUchida was born April 1, 1920, in Calexico, Calif., the third of five children. He grew up in Garden Grove, helping grow strawberries and tomatoes. At 10 he learned judo, part of a traditional method for Japanese parents in America to instill their culture in young men.\nIn 1940, Uchida enrolled at San Jose State, where he studied chemical engineering and was student-coach of the physical education department’s judo program. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was drafted into the Army, where he served in the medical corps as a laboratory technician.\nFor a generation of Japanese-Americans, the American dream disintegrated on Feb. 19, 1942. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to the removal of about 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans from the West Coast during the war. Uchida’s parents were incarcerated at a camp in Arizona; his brothers were sent to the Tule Lake Relocation Center in Northern California; his sister and her husband were sent to an internment camp in Idaho.\nReminders of that have never left. In fact, the building on campus that now houses the judo dojo — renamed Yoshihiro Uchida Hall in 1997 — was a processing center for internment camps.\nLike African-American soldiers serving during World War II, American-born Japanese who were United States citizens — Nisei — served in segregated units where they were subjected to much of the same racist treatment.\nUchida recalled an episode in 1942 at Camp Crowder in Missouri when a burly white soldier confronted a group of Nisei and referred to them as Japs. Uchida, who stood 5 feet 5 inches, took offense and challenged the soldier. A scuffle ensued, and Uchida took down the stunned soldier with a judo throw. “I was a hero in the barracks,” he said.\nAfter four years of service, Uchida returned to San Jose State and earned a degree in biological science. He also resumed teaching and taught judo to police candidates.\nFortunately, a friend who was a supervisor for the county had a friend at O’Connor Hospital and arranged for Uchida to be hired as a lab technician in the emergency room, where he worked the overnight shift. Uchida eventually became a lab supervisor at San Jose Hospital.\nHis passion remained judo, and his crusade was to help establish it as a sport sanctioned by the Amateur Athletic Union, which, with the help and influence of Henry Stone, the judo and wrestling coach at California, came about in 1953.\nThat year, San Jose State sponsored the first nationwide A.A.U. championships. In 1962, Uchida organized the first national collegiate judo championships, which San Jose State won. (Judo is still not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A.) He and Stone helped judo become an Olympic event, and Uchida was the coach of the United States’ first Olympic judo team, which competed at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo and won a bronze medal.\nAs a Japanese-American, “to be elevated to coach an American Olympic team was something you never dreamed of,” Uchida said.\nWilliam C. Rhoden talks with Yoshihiro Uchida, judo coach at San Jose State for 66 years and of the first United States Olympic judo team, who has no plans to retire.\nJudo was not enough to sustain Uchida and his young family, however. Unable to get a home loan because of insufficient income, Uchida, who was still teaching judo, went into business on his own. He bought a failing medical laboratory from an acquaintance in 1957 for $3,000, putting $75 down and paying the balance in increments. Using friendships and connections with doctors he had worked with, Uchida turned the business into a profitable venture. Part of the profits kept San Jose State judo afloat.\nDuring the next three decades, Uch",

They built a sprawling $80 million complex of housing and commercial units in San Jose’s Japantown, converting an eyesore into an impressive community.\nAfter more than nine decades of living, Uchida said, chief among the many lessons he has learned is that if you have a cause or a mission, determination alone is not sufficient to see it through.\nUchida uses the internment camps as an example of what can happen to the uninvolved. He recalled how Japanese-Americans were scapegoated and stereotyped and became the target of unfounded suspicions.\nUchida added: “Sometimes, you get kicked around. But if you believe in it, just keep pushing ahead. You might have to find out how to get there by going backward and then coming back again.",

He also bought a 10-acre ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where he raised cattle and grew grapes. He sold the ranch in 1990 for $1.5 million.\nUchida’s wife, Masako, died in 2007. They had two children, a son, Yoshihiro Jr., who is a professor of biology at San Jose State, and a daughter, Yoko, who is a professor of nursing at the University of San Francisco.\nUchida, who has been inducted into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame and the California Judo Hall of Fame, has no",

But a growing body of work shows these diseases may be exacerbated by traumatic stress, the researchers found.\nFor example, veterans with PTSD are two to three times more likely to develop heart disease than those who do not have the disorder.\n\"These are young men and women, most of whom do not yet have heart disease,\" said Dr. Beth Cohen, a staff physician at the hospital, in a statement about her research. \"If we can learn why they are at greater risk now, we can find ways to help avoid heart disease later in life.\"\nUnlike heart disease, no effective ways to prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease yet exist, but researchers are studying soldiers' brains to learn more about how combat-related stress affects the brain's biology and increases the chance of developing Alzheimer's.\nThey have found that a section of the hippocampus - the part of the brain that is devoted to short-term memory and learning new things - is significantly smaller in veterans with PTSD. Researchers are trying to determine if this smaller section can grow over time with therapy and treatment for stress.\n\"It's possible new stem cells, new brain cells are made, or it's possible the existing neurons or cells get plumper or have more synapses and connection,\" said Weiner, also professor of medicine, radiology, psychiatry and neurology at UCSF. \"Nobody knows. Our ability to probe the brain and understand these mechanisms is really limited.\"\nWeiner and his colleagues at the VA hope their research will help veterans like 37-year-old Ben Sykes, who enlisted in the Marine Corps after Sept. 11, 2001, and was among the first troops to move into Baghdad and then into Saddam Hussein's primary palace in Tikrit in 2003.\nWhen Sykes returned to civilian life and his previous career as an interaction Web designer, he found himself trying to re-create the intensity of combat through drinking and extreme sports.\n\"I have read the greatest pharmacy on the planet is your hypothalamus,\" said Sykes, referring to the part of the brain responsible for certain metabolic processes and secretion of some hormones. \"It changes your body's chemistry.

        "prompt": "3 Why Is it Important for a Company to Have an External or Internal Audit System?\n4 What Are the Functions of a Cost Center in a Management Accounting System?\nDo you feel like your small business could be spending less and operating more efficiently? An internal audit helps you locate areas where your business can save time and money by examining the day-to-day tasks of workers and pointing out areas for improvement. Audits also identify areas of waste in the business and fraudulent spending or improper transactions by employees. On your path to long-term success, make an internal audit a regular investment – it will pay off in the end.\nSmall businesses lose millions every year to employee theft. Types of fraud committed by employees include skimming payments from customers, check tampering, cash theft, misuse of company credit cards and improper payroll transactions.\nYou may believe your business lacks the staff to create an internal audit policy or carry out audits to combat these problems. However, even with a small staff, you can create a program for monitoring work and their behavior. In fact, announcing a policy of internally auditing financial transactions may keep an employee from misusing company resources.\nA formal internal audit includes tasks besides detecting fraud. Examining policies and procedures on a regular basis ensures your business minimizes its exposure to fraud and other losses. Examining credit lines extended to customers is one such area of loss prevention. If you have formulated a policy regarding extension of credit, internal audits test compliance with that policy. Designing a credit policy with the intention of reducing bad debt does no good if not followed.\nOperational audits examine the practices of a company, instead of its finances. Is your business operating at maximum efficiency? Ineffective operations add to overhead without increasing profit. An operational audit may reveal these inefficiencies or point to time lost on unnecessary paperwork.\nIs your business following applicable regulations? Finding out you do not comply with a government regulation before the government helps your business avoid fines or other legal",
        "baseline": " actions. A rapidly expanding enterprise needs to monitor compliance with human resource laws as new employees join the company. Internal audit performs a vital service in reviewing these functions.\nYour small business likely cannot afford to create an internal audit department, but with careful planning, you can create a system for checking up on your company and its workers. This less formal system can still provide the information you need to improve your operations and financial controls. Such an internal audit requires two people working as a team. This avoids personality conflicts and prevents the auditor from simply checking his own work. It also provides an opportunity for the team members to discuss results and prepare an objective report to ownership.\nThomas, Jeffrey. \"The Importance of the Internal Audit Function in a Company.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-internal-audit-function-company-21496.html. 07 March 2019.\nWhat Are the Advantages of Having an External Audit?",

        "prompt": "The final instalment in the trilogy of climate change reports from the IPCC is released today. And there's some good news: the world can afford to transition to clean energy and climate change can be averted without sacrificing our living standards.\n• The cheapest and best way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to abandon fossil fuels over the next 10 years. Clean energy would have to treble in output by 2050.\n• Fracking could be an important intermediary measure as the energy mix moves to become cleaner, but only if coal is abandoned.\n• Fears that cutting carbon would destroy the economy were dismissed. The report calculated that moving from fossil fuels to renewables would reduce expected annual economic growth rates by 0.06%.\nWe've collected reactions from thought leaders and experts here.\nIt is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living. It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too.\nThe [IPCC] report provides sobering insight as to how urgent and substantial the challenge of reducing our emissions will be to best ensure we can limit warming to 2°C. While those challenges may initially appear daunting, it’s important to focus on the menu of solutions the report outlines. Furthermore, the report finds that there are significant “co-benefits” of reducing emissions, which make mitigation action even more imperative. For example, the report shows that low-emissions pathways not only reduce countries’ vulnerability to energy price volatility and supply disruptions, they produce significant benefits for human health and ecosystems by curbing air pollution.\nWe may be on the wrong emissions pathway now, but with ambitious action, there is still a chance to move onto the right one. Now is the time for governments at all levels to adopt comprehensive climate policies and invest in a low-carbon future — so that we don’t end up paying the price later.\nChina could break the deadlock in UN climate talks by presenting an ambitious new target with binding emissions cuts.

I'm not even retired yet.\"\nWarburton said he wanted to do something \"special\" to mark Donahue's 50th year on the job, and naming the tower after him fit the bill.\n\"I broached management with it, and they thought it was great idea,\" Warburton said. \"Jimmy has done a lot for Hampton Beach. He is our five-star at our five-star beach.\"\nDonahue began his career as a Hampton Beach lifeguard at the age of 16 in the summer of 1960. He worked as a guard during summer breaks from high school, Boston University, and also when he taught physical education and science at Whittier Regional Vocational Technical High School in Haverhill, Mass.\nHe became head of lifeguards in 1973, and last summer marked his 34th year in that position; he oversees 40-plus guards.

It will be located at the north end of the Hampton Beach parking lot, and will be used by the Beach Patrol to monitor the water and provide assistance to bathers.\nIn addition to Donahue, other members of the Beach Patrol will be honored during the 2010-2011 winter off-season, when a series of new lifeguard towers are scheduled to go up at the north and south end of the Hampton Beach parking lot.",

I live on the on the 400 block of Hinton Street. A couple of months ago our family cat was killed by a pack of dogs. This past week another of our cats was killed by the same pack of dogs. After the first kill, my wife called animal control. Animal control said the truck they use would not be available until 9 a.m. My wife told them the dogs were on my back porch. My question here is the advice from animal control about trapping and I can't understand why an officer was not sent by to see for themselves that these dogs were loose. Anyway, in the end nothing was done.\nDuring the second kill at 4 a.m. the same dogs were loose. My wife and I tried to chase them away but my wife slipped and fell and almost broke her ankle. Our next door neighbor who just moved here witnessed the entire event. I proceeded to follow the dogs in my car for over an hour until they arrived at their residence.

        "prompt": "“We don’t want to have a depleted military, fighting all over the place,” Trump said, words many people heard with excitement, misunderstanding him that this meant less war, and peace in our time, as he simultaneously vowed to boost defense spending.\nHe wants to do this, he says, so that America maintains military dominance, to “ward off any threats”. But we know that when American presidents speak of “warding off threats” they are speaking of nations that refuse to kowtow to them. They want to maintain their military dominance, not because of any threats, for no one threatens them except in their imagination, or on the fields of battle of the nations they have invaded and occupied, or themselves actively threaten, but because without that dominance they cannot break the arms of those that choose to live outside their shadow, nor bribe the rest, since loss of military dominance would mean the end of the hegemony of the dollar, whose inflated value depends on American military tyranny.\nThis aggressive policy he describes as “Peace through strength,” words that speak volumes about the thrust of the incoming president’s foreign policy since it is the same phrase that Ronald Reagan used to justify the massive military buildup during Reagan’s two terms in office that led, in part to the destruction of the Soviet Union.\nThis is the same policy of “peace through strength” that saw Reagan try to overturn the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua, using the terrorists known as the “contras” to tear Nicaragua apart until the Sandinistas were forced from power.\nThis is the same policy that saw the US supporting the suppression of the popular left movement in El Salvador where US death squads murdered thousands, and supporting the abduction and murder of thousands of leftists across Latin America in Operation Condor. In 1983 Reagan ordered the invasion and destruction of the socialist government of the tiny island of Grenada. He supported Baby Doc Duvalier in Haiti and his ton tons macoutes, Marcos in Philippines, the white apartheid government of South Africa, egged on both sides in the Iraq-Iran War while selling weapons to them both and used Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan to destroy its socialist government and harass the USSR there.\nTrump, in effect has just announced the official resumption of the Cold War, that euphemism for a heightened state of threat and insecurity provoked by the United States in order to intimidate the rest of the world and during which real wars take place while total war is daily threatened.\nThe evidence that American foreign policy will be just as aggressive with Trump as it would have been with Clinton is clear. Anyone who doubts it need only look at General “Mad Dog” Mattis and his appointment as Secretary of Defence, and the appointment of another aggressive general, and head of military intelligence, Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser. He will appoint Marine General John Kelly to head of “Homeland” security. Another general, the disgraced Petraeus, is being considered as Director of National Intelligence, or as UN ambassador.\nTrump’s continuation of America’s belligerence was signaled with the insult to China when he accepted a call from the leader of the government of the Chinese province of Taiwan, the island to which the Kuomintang anti-communist forces fled in 1949. It has long been the policy of the United States to accept Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and therefore the US has no official diplomatic links with Taiwan as a sovereign state. The Chinese regard Taiwan as a rebel province and so any attempt by a foreign head of state to communicate with its government should go through Beijing. Trump deliberately threw that respect for China down the drain by openly talking with the Taiwanese leader who is known to want to make Taiwan independent. For the Chinese this was taken as a signal that the US recognizes Taiwan as independent, and the US meant it to be seen as such. The Chinese protested angrily and warned of trouble in reaction.\nAll the words of oil poured on these troubled waters by the Obama administration to reassure China that things will stay as they have been are meaningless since this phone call is just a natural and logical advancement of Obama’s “pivot to Asia,” that is the US intention to reduce China to a dependency or at least a vassal state that needs US permission to sail in its own waters while the Americans presume to own its seas and coasts.\nTrump’s action is completely in line with the increasing aggression by the United States towards China evidenced by Obama’s shifting of large portions of the American navy and air forces to the Pacific and South China Seas, including the transfer last summer of B1 and B2 bombers to Guam which can be used to carry nuclear tipped cruise missiles and by the routine violation of Chinese territorial waters by American warships all this year. The appointment of Iowa governor Branstad as US ambassador to China, a man who has connections in China, does not offer any real hope of Trump moderating American policy towards China. All that appointment means is that Branstad will be used as the nice cop while the US Navy sits off the Chinese coast waiting to come in as the bad cop if Branstad can’t sweet talk the Chinese into surrendering their sovereignty.\nMeanwhile NATO aggression against Russia continues, “sanctions” have increased and been renewed to a permanent state, and the anti-Russian propaganda, already at hysterical levels, is maintained with the appearance in the Washington Post of a list of news media, journals and blogs considered to be “Russian agents.” It is clear that this list was put together and released, through the device of a front group called Propornot, by American intelligence services.\nThis is a dangerous step and threatens further action aimed at suppressing the alternative media and writers that oppose US aggressive foreign policy and the regressive and cruel economic policies inflicted on the people of the United States by its industrial-financial ruling class. Already the media are full of stories about “fake” news and what is and what is not. We are now forced to continually defend ourselves as the ones writing about the real facts while the mass media put out the fabrications and distortions. It is difficult enough to get the facts out without having to defend against charges of serving the “enemy” while doing so.\nTrump’s complaint that America is “fighting in areas we shouldn’t be fighting in” is not a sign of a man of peace but of a man who has listened to those American military strategists who realize that the objective of trying to seize the oil supplies of Iraq, Iran and Russia through attacking the periphery of Asia is not working due to local resistance and help given to the resistance by Russia, China, Iran and others. So the strategy will shift further towards conflict with the larger powers that stand in the way of US global hegemony. Once they are neutralized then local resistance will be easier to deal with.\nThis is confirmed by the release by the Pentagon of its latest National Military Strategy, dated 2015, that states its primary purpose is to maintain an “international order advanced by US leadership” for the benefit of a “a US economy in an open international economic system.” It then lists the main obstacles to achieving this dominance, Russia, primarily, then China, Iran and North Korea, which are described as threats to American national interests.\n“International order advanced by US leadership,” means an American world order, that is American rule of the world, and for the sole benefit of American capitalism. The defeat of the US and EU in Syria will not lead to a lull in American imperialism. We must remember that the Reagan military build up to create “peace through strength” was a reaction to the strategic defeat of the United States in Vietnam which in turn was partly due to Soviet assistance in the Vietnam war during which the Soviet air defence forces aiding the Vietnamese inflicted massive losses on American air forces.",
        "baseline": " The aftermath of that defeat was the build-up of US forces and we see the same thing promised now by Trump.\nWe can expect nothing from the new American regime except more of the same, more war, more world misery, more repression and increasing climatic disasters with the Trump appointment of Mr. Pruitt as head of the American Environmental Agency, a man who denies that climate change is due to man’s industrial activity, and whose irrational and dangerous thinking will mean the end of any attempts to prevent the climate catastrophe that is unfolding around us.\nThose of us who struggle to attain some semblance of economic, political and social justice in the world must carry on regardless, carry on speaking, writing, and hoping that the young ones with the energy will see what needs to be done and do what needs to be done, take the power from those who abuse it.

So goes the old actors’ saying, and sadly, some know from experience. Through the ages, actors, musicians, and other performers have gone out on a high note, leaving this mortal coil before the crowd could ask for an encore.\nBiggest controversy: Another old saying goes, “Guns don’t kill people—no, wait, that’s stupid, of course they do.” The “bullet catch” magic trick, which felled last week’s subject, the white man who performed as Chung Ling Soo, has claimed many magicians. In 1820, Madame Delinsky was accidentally shot when one of the six (!) gunmen shooting at her mistakenly used a live round. In 1840, Arnold Buck gave a gun to a volunteer from the audience, who used a blank bullet per the trick, but also surreptitiously inserted nails into the gun barrel.\nGuns are deadly to non-magicians, too. In 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum was bored on the set of the TV series Cover Up, unloaded the blanks in a prop gun and amused himself by pretending to play Russian roulette. Except he had forgotten to unload one blank, and had the bad luck to spin the cylinder to that chamber. The force of the blank firing at close range was enough to kill him. And famously, Brandon Lee was killed in 1993 while filming The Crow when a prop gun was improperly loaded, causing a blank shot to propel a bullet stuck in the barrel from a previous misfire at Lee.\nNot all onstage gun deaths are accidental. Jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan was shot and killed on stage by his wife in 1972. Pantera guitarist “Dimebag” Darrell Abbott was performing with his post-Pantera band, Damageplan, in 2004, when a gunmen leapt on stage, shooting and killing Abbott and three others. And in 2013, Brazil’s “King Of Funk,” MC Daleste, was shot in the abdomen in front of a crowd of 4,000 people, dying later that day.\nStrangest fact: One of the numerous traditional actors’ superstitions (and for those of you out there reading, good luck, and… Macbeth!), the color green being bad luck dates back to one of the earliest recorded (at least, by Wikipedia) onstage deaths. French actor and playwright Molière, whose works are still performed at the Comédie-Française more than any other playwright, died in 1673 while starring in one of his own plays, Le Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac). Contrary to the title, Molière had a very real case of tuberculosis, had a violent coughing fit during the play, and died on stage. He was wearing green at the time, and the color has been bad luck ever since.\nThing we were happiest to learn: Not much to be happy about on a list of deaths, apart from some lives well lived. In 2016, Jane Little, a bassist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra collapsed at the end of a performance’s final number, “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” No one knew that better than Little, who died at 87 after performing with the orchestra for 71 years. The following year, jam-band staple Colonel Bruce Hampton died on his 70th birthday, surrounded by friends and admirers, during an all-star concert to honor the occasion.\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Wrestling may be fake, but the danger is real. In 1969, Mike DiBiase (adoptive father of Ted “The Million Dollar Man” DiBiase) died of a heart attack in the middle of a match. Three years later, Luther Lindsay, one of the first black pro wrestlers to become a major star, died while performing the winning move in a match. In 1987, British wrestler “King Kong” Kirk died of a pre-existing heart condition when his opponent landed on him. In 1993, Larry Cameron died of a heart attack during a match. Japanese wrestler Mitsuhara Misawa and Mexican wrestler Perro Aguayo Jr. each suffered cervical spine injuries in the ring which led to immediate cardiac arrest and death. And in 1999, Owen Hart (brother and tag-team partner of Bret “The Hitman” Hart) made his entrance to a pay-per-view event gliding down from the roof of the arena, when the safety harness released, dropping him 78 feet onto the ropes. His aorta tore, his lungs filled with blood, and he died shortly after.\nFurther down the Wormhole: Hard to",

        "prompt": "Here are the food-service offerings from several of the more popular airlines, along with Diet Detective’s comments and ratings (Health score: 5 stars = highest rating.\nComments: The airline continues to improve upon its food and its transparency. VA has such a commitment to food, I just don’t understand why it don’t offer healthy individual snacks — nothing even close. How about an apple or an orange? I am impressed that the average meal has dropped by 24.38 calories. But calories aren’t everything.\nBest bets: Avoid the individual snack if you can. Even the nuts, which are the best choice, are high in calories if you consume the entire package. Always choose a real meal if you can. Even if it’s slightly more calories, it will keep you full longer.\nComments: Delta continues its commitment to improving its food in terms of health and consciousness. Over the summer, the airline launched new menus called Flight Fuel, which replaced the EATS program. The new menus attempt to focus on “transparency into ingredient and allergen information for customers.” Along with the new Flight Fuel launch, Delta also upped its nutrition game this year by providing a key on the menu for snack items that are non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and lacto-ovo vegetarian. Also, the tapas box is the U.S. airline industry’s only non-GMO snack box.\nDelta continues to work with Luvo (www.Luvoinc.com), which has a very strong commitment to healthy eating. All the calorie information for the Luvo items are listed on Delta’s menu (and online); but be aware that the calories listed apply only to the individual sandwich or wrap, not the entire meal — which can be confusing if you don’t see the asterisk.\nBest bets: For a snack, the nuts are the best choice — even over the lower-calorie pretzels. The vegan, gmo-free tapas snack box is a good healthy choice if you share or make it a meal (it’s too high in calories as a snack). The best bests are the super seed crackers, Snapea Crisps, dark chocolate, almonds, hummus, and quinoa with pepper dip.\nComments: The individual snacks are still low in calories as well as nutritional value. The airline continues to post nutritional information for its meals, however, it doesn’t post the nutritional information for snacks. The a la carte snacks are no longer available, but they were high in calories. Once an innovator in the air, JetBlue, the sixth-largest U.S. carrier, has certainly fallen behind in the food department. We need to see more foods like Chobani yogurt, and fewer Cheez-Its.\nBest bets: Still not too much in the way of healthy individual snacks. As for the meal boxes, we still like the Pump Up, which has healthy ingredients (Mary’s Gone Crackers-Original, olives, hummus and bean crisps), but remember that it’s a meal and should not be eaten as a snack (skip the olives if you are sodium sensitive). Skip the other meal boxes, which are high in calories and fat and offer little in terms of nutrition. If you are on a flight that offers the Eat Up Café, the yogurt and granola (you might want to limit the honey), the kale and quinoa salad and the spicy soba and Korean-style chicken are all good choices.\nComments: United’s individual snacks are up in average calories from 283 to 375.6, but the overall calorie count for everything is only slightly higher. United is the fourth-largest airline in the U.S.; it should be thinking about healthy food. Years ago, it was No. 1 in this area. The breakfast, lunch and dinner menu has many new options; however, healthy meal choices are limited.\nBest bets: Among the individual snacks, the hummus is the best choice. Or else share the Sweet & Savory Bistro Blend Trail Mix with at least a few others. Get the tapas snack box, which is high in calories but has many healthy foods, including almonds, olives, hummus and bruschetta; just toss out the cheese spread. For breakfast, your best bet is the chicken sausage egg skillet, but skip the chicken sausage to save calories. Also, skip the ham baguette. For lunch/dinner, the airline removed last year’s best bet, the wrap and salad combo. The new options are not great; however, the Mediterranean chicken wrap is your best bet and should keep you full.\nComments: American now provides complimentary snacks on flights of more than 250 miles — not healthy ones though. The average number of calories per meal has gone done, other than the snack boxes (398 to 497). Unfortunately, AA decided to remove the chicken Cobb salad, which was one of our Best Bets last year, and replaced it with a higher-calorie turkey and chutney sandwich.\nFurthermore, we were unhappy to find out that the Fort Worth-based airline decided not to publish food menu information on its website, a strange move leading to even less food transparency. The airline continues to lose out on what could be a tremendous financial opportunity — healthy foods often have larger profit margins and customers will be happier.\nBest bets: For individual snacks, the hummus and chips is still your best choice. Skip the snack box unless you toss the salami and cheese. The Thai ginger chicken wrap is a good choice, but skip the sesame-ginger dressing. For breakfast on flights of more than two but less than three hours, there’s not much to eat; and while the trail mix may seem like a healthy choice, it’s very high in calories. On flights of three hours or more, the breakfast sandwich is an OK choice as long as you go light on the honey mustard dressing.\nComments: Not much variety and not much in terms of nutritional value. We wish it would add some healthy snacks or at least test a few. The Dallas-based airline is one of the larger carriers in the U.S., so it would be great for Southwest to set an example and show that healthy food can sell if it is tasty and curated with consciousness.\nBest bet: The peanuts are the best, even though the pretzels are lower in calories. There haven’t been many healthy changes to the menu, and don’t be fooled by the word “veggie” in the wheat thins.\nComments: The airline’s media spokesperson doesn’t respond to emails or calls. Paraphrasing him from previous years: passengers should bring their own food and drinks. But in my opinion, the airline has a responsibility to serve foods that are healthier. The good news: The calorie count has gone down from last year to 366. The bad news is that there are few healthy options.\nBest bet: The cup of noodle soup at 290 calories is still the only choice that will feel like a real meal, but it is very high in sodium, so it is not the best bet for someone who is sodium-sensitive or has high blood pressure. All the muffins are at least 400 calories — not the best choices unless you split one (if you’re the type of person who can do that). The chips and salsa is the lowest-calorie choice of all the snacks but probably won’t fill you up. Skip the snack box.\nComments: The PR team was back with its typical nasty, condescending tone.

For example, the child was in fact fostered by an English speaking family of mixed race.\nJudge Sapnara said her decision remove the child from foster care was not taken “as a result of undue media involvement” but rather “because of the evidence available to the court today, that the grandmother is an appropriate carer for the child",

The judge ordered the council to conduct an urgent investigation into issues reported by The Times, saying the newspaper had acted responsibly in raising “very concerning” matters of “legitimate public interest”‘. It doesn’t actually mention ‘reporting’ at all, it simply talks about raising matters of public interest.
