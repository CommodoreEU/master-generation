I said to them: ''Anything you're about, I got that sign in my basement 20 years ago''.\n'What we are saying is, to have a message that appeals to people in a way that does not menace them.\nHer words come after she appeared to belittle Rep.

Yeah,' the Speaker adds.\nPelosi may have been referring to the Justice Democrats, a political action committee that supported a small slate of seven representatives that includes Ocasio-Cortez.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus, however, includes 78 members of the House of Representatives and Senator Bernie Sanders, according to its website.\nEarlier this month, Pelosi also appeared to take a subtle swipe at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while discussing members of Congress with large Twitter followings.\nShe made it clear that the number of followers will not impress her, but rather how good representatives are at passing",

But while these artists have been able to break through into the mainstream, the drillaz have remained underground, releasing their music independently and through their own label, 67 Records. And while they may not have the same level of exposure as their more established counterparts, the drillaz are still making a name for themselves in the UK rap scene. Led by MCs such as Digga D, Skengdo, and AM, the drillaz have been making waves with their raw and unapologetic lyrics, which often deal with the realities of life in South London.",

        "prompt": "It’s here. The last week of the regular season. And I have even worse of a chance to catch Rosenthal as the Jets do of making it to the playoffs.\nBut I can’t give up now. With a two-game win in Week 16, the game is down to seven games. We disagree on four this week. With a sweep, the 11 postseason games could get interesting.\nLast week, I finished 10-6. Rosey was a pathetic 8-8. For the year, he’s 159-81. I’m 152-88.\nFlorio’s take: The Lions should try to beat the Packers, in order to avoid having to go back to New Orleans for the first round of the playoffs. The Packers should try to beat the Lions, in order to force them to return to the Superdome. Green Bay remains the better team, as long as they go with their starters.\nFlorio’s pick: Packers 34, Lions 24.\nRosenthal’s take: The Packers aren’t likely to play their starters four quarters. That doesn’t mean this will be a cakewalk for Detroit. Ask the 2004 Bills about playing a No. 1 seed’s backups. Or the 2010 Patriots about facing Matt Flynn. Still, Detroit wants to avoid a trip to New Orleans. Their defensive line will make the difference.\nRosenthal’s pick: Lions 28, Packers 27.\nFlorio’s take: Technically, it’s a meaningless game for the Texans. But with two ugly losses in a row, the AFC South champs need to build some confidence and momentum before the postseason begins. Though Tennessee still has a shot at the postseason, they’re not ready to beat a quality-yet-flawed team on the road.\nFlorio’s pick: Texans 24, Titans 16.\nRosenthal’s take: I believe Gary Kubiak when he says he’ll play this game like any other. The Texans don’t want to hit the playoffs on a three-game losing streak. T.J. Yates needs his defense and running game to carry him. They will on Sunday.\nRosenthal’s pick: Texans 21, Titans 17.\nFlorio’s take: If the Colts win, they lose. If they lose, they win. So they’ll lose. And win. The question, of course, is what they’ll lose. And what they’ll win.\nFlorio’s pick: Jaguars 10, Colts 6.\nRosenthal’s take: The Colts were in this spot in 1997. They had a random two-game winning streak in late December to put the No. 1 overall pick in jeopardy. They lost in Minnesota in the season finale, ensuring the top pick and Peyton Manning. Expect history to repeat. The Colts haven’t won on the road yet and the Jaguars aren’t lucky enough to lose.\nRosenthal’s pick: Jaguars 16, Colts 13.\nFlorio’s take: Of all the things that must happen for the Jets to make it to the playoffs, the hardest part could be the business to which the Jets must personally tend — beating the Dolphins in Miami. Once 0-7, the Dolphins have improved dramatically in the second half of the season. But the Jets seem to be destined to swipe another playoff berth, which means that the Jets will have to find a way to punch their way out of a corner yet another time.\nFlorio’s pick: Jets 20, Dolphins 17.\nRosenthal’s take: The Dolphins are playing well. The Jets are playing lousy, but I’m still convinced Rex Ryan’s lap band is made out of horseshoe particles. Don’t be surprised if the Jets still sneak in the playoffs.\nRosenthal’s pick: Jets 20, Dolphins 17.\nFlorio’s take: Last month, the Bears were 7-3 and poised to give the Packers a run for their money in the playoffs. After injuries to Jay Cutler and Matt Forte, the Bears have lost five in a row. Though the Vikings also have lost their starting tailback, they’re trying desperately to get a boost as they head into the offseason. As long as Chris Kluwe doesn’t kick to Devin Hester, the Vikings should be able to give the Bears the boot.\nFlorio’s pick: Vikings 27, Bears 20.\nRosenthal’s take: Josh McCown remains at quarterback for the Bears. Toby Gerhart and Kahil Bell will be the primary running backs. I used to think the 18-game season could work, but can you imagine two more weeks like this?\nRosenthal’s pick: Vikings 24, Bears 20.\nFlorio’s take: With a win, the Pats lock up the No. 1 seed. With another huge passing performance, Tom Brady could leapfrog Drew Brees. One will happen, and the other might.\nFlorio’s pick: Patriots 35, Bills 17.\nRosenthal’s take: The way to beat New England: Hit Tom Brady, keeping Brady guessing by changing up your looks, and play great man-to-man coverage against the Patriots receivers. The Bills secondary can handle the last part of the equation, but Buffalo’s pass rush is non-existent.\nRosenthal’s pick: Patriots 37, Bills 21.\nFlorio’s take: The Saints plan to go “full steam ahead,” and they’ll need every ounce of it to beat the up-and-coming Panthers. Though it’ll take an epic upset by the Rams over the 49ers to help the Saints improve their playoff positioning, this one is as much about ensuring that Drew Brees will fend off Tom Brady for the all-time single-season passing yardage record.\nFlorio’s pick: Saints 42, Panthers 31.\nRosenthal’s take: I first picked the Panthers in this game based on the logic that Sean Payton will pull his starters once he sees the 49ers take a big lead in St. Louis. And then I remembered the Saints could score 30 in the first half.\nRosenthal’s pick: Saints 40, Panthers 38.\nFlorio’s take: With four straight wins to finish the 2011 season, the Eagles will give themselves a significant boost heading into 2012. Though neither team technically has anything to play for, the Eagles know the value of creating some doubt as to whether the best team will actually win the Super Bowl; there’s a chance that the best team as of right now won’t be in the playoff field at all.\nFlorio’s pick: Eagles 34, Redskins 20.\nRosenthal’s take: The Eagles have saved some jobs with their effort the last three weeks. One more win, and they will finish in second place in the division because of a tiebreaker advantage over Dallas and New York. So that’s pretty exciting. The Redskins have clinched double digit losses for a third straight year.\nRosenthal’s pick: Eagles 26, Redskins 16.\nFlorio’s take: If this were John Harbaugh’s team, we’d be worried about the Ravens playing down to the Rams’ level. Then again, the Ravens rolled the Rams in St. Louis earlier this year. With the No. 2 seed hanging in the balance, the Niners will, too.\nFlorio’s pick: 49ers 27, Rams 7.\nRosenthal’s take: The Rams aren’t competitive in a league where almost everyone is competitive. Only four of their losses were by less than a 12-point margin. Five losses were by more than 20 points. It’s almost impossible to survive a season like that when it comes in a coach’s third year.\nRosenthal’s pick: 49ers 24, Rams 3.\nFlorio’s take: Before Week One, anyone would have assumed that a Week 17 battle between a pair of 7-8 NFC West teams would have involved a home playoff game for the winner. But with the 49ers at 12-3, it’s one of Sunday’s few meaningless games, except as it relates to draft order. With Kevin Kolb out, John Skelton has only one more chance to show what he can do. Until Kolb gets injured again in 2012.\nFlorio’s pick: Cardinals 23, Seahawks 20.\nRosenthal’s take: Both the Cardinals and Seahawks have reasons for optimism heading into 2011 after second-half runs that fell short of the playoffs. Seattle’s success has a better foundation and is based less on lucky finishes. The Seahawks defense is the best unit in this game.\nRosenthal’s pick: Seahawks 24, Cardinals 17.\nFlorio’s take: The Buccaneers have played the Falcons tough in recent years. But the Bucs currently are in a full-blown free-fall. Even as they play for their coach’s job, the Bucs are struggling to simply remain competitive. And if/when the Lions lose to the Packers, the Falcons will have an opportunity to avoid having to go back to New Orleans for the wild-card round.\nFlorio’s pick: Falcons 35, Buccaneers 21.\nRosenthal’s take: If the Lions win in Green Bay early, the Falcons will be stuck in the No. 6 seed. That means Chris Redman could make an appearance in this game. And Chris Redman can throw on this Bucs defense.\nRosenthal’s pick: Falcons 30, Buccaneers 21.\nFlorio’s take: The Bengals haven’t been able to take down the big boys in the AFC North. But they lost by only seven points at Baltimore, and Sunday’s game has high stakes for both teams. Still, since it’s essentially a playoff game for the Bengals and given that the Bengals are 0-2 in playoff games under Marvin Lewis, the Ravens’ desire to secure the bye and a home game likely will prevail.\nFlorio’s pick: Ravens 17, Bengals 16.\nRosenthal’s take: The Ravens can’t beat mediocre competition on the road (San Diego, Jacksonville, Tennessee, and Seattle.) The Bengals can’t seem to beat playoff teams. (They’re 0-5 against teams already in the playoffs.) Something has to give here. It’s more likely to include the team with the rookie quarterback.\nRosenthal’s pick: Ravens 21, Bengals 17.\nFlorio’s take: With or without Ben Roethlisberger, the Steelers are the better team. And with the Ravens-Bengals game possibly going down to the wire, any scoreboard-watching by the Steelers will point to maintaining the pedal to the proverbial metal.\nFlorio’s pick: Steelers 20, Browns 10.\nRosenthal’s take: The combined record of the three teams that beat Pittsburgh this year: 33-12. The combined record of the Cleveland Browns: 4-11. The Steelers won’t need a lot from Ben Roethlisberger.\nRosenthal’s pick: Steelers 23, Browns 10.\nFlorio’s take: The Prodigal Son returns to Denver, with Kyle Orton looking to punish the Broncos for their good deed of giving him his freedom. And if the Chiefs can topple the Broncos and knock them out of the playoffs, it’ll be a long offseason for anyone and everyone who was involved in the decision to let Orton walk away. If Tim Tebow can save the front office from that fate, maybe he will end up with the starting job, for life.\nFlorio’s pick: Broncos 14, Chiefs 13.\nRosenthal’s take: The Chiefs have the personnel to play man coverage on the outside and load up the box to stop Denver’s run game. They also have a quarterback competent enough to score on a suddenly vulnerable secondary. Tebow struggled last week, but it was also alarming to see the Bills offense score on four straight drives of at least 55 yards.\nRosenthal’s pick: Chiefs 17, Broncos 14.\nFlorio’s take: The Raiders have a shot at their first winning season since 2002, and with a little help a playoff berth. The Chargers have no shot at saving the skin of Norv Turner. Reeling after last weekend’s blowout in Detroit, the Chargers could be in for a similar fate in Oakland.\nFlorio’s pick: Raiders 27, Chargers 10.\nRosenthal’s take: San Diego’s no-show last week was the worst game by a team fighting for a playoff spot since . . . San Diego’s no-show in Cincinnati of Week 16 last season. The Raiders finally have their receivers healthy. Deion Sanders would call this a “U-Haul” game for San Diego. They are ready to go.\nRosenthal’s pick: Raiders 33, Chargers 30.\nFlorio’s take: The 256th game of the 2011 regular season also will be the first game of the 2011 postseason. Since I picked the Cowboys to win the division way back in September, I can’t abandon them now. Even if logic and common sense points to the Giants finishing their unlikely late-season climb to the postseason.\nRosenthal’s take: They Giants are as dangerous as their pass rush allows. It was great last week, with Justin Tuck finally looking healthy. Osi Umenyiora returns this week. There is no figuring out this Giants team, but I took them to win the NFC East before the year and can’t give up now.\nRosenthal’s pick: Giants 24, Cowboys 21.\nBOTH of you? The Jets? Playoffs? Seriously?\nBad picks this week guys!\nDid you seriously just say the Eagles might be the best team?? Are you kidding they win a few games and they are the “dream team” again. I got a good laugh out of that.\nThank you! If you guys are right, then the JETS will make ther play-offs but then again your record on picking winners is not that good!!\n“there’s a chance that the best team as of right now won’t be in the playoff field at all”.\nThis has to be a typo. The Eagles are better than the Packers, Saints, Patriots, Steelers, Ravens, 49ers, and Lions as of “right now”?\nTwo pictures of that “other” Manning guy on one page??? Give me a break!! Dont you have a picture of Brett farve somewhere???\nThe scenario for the Chiefs/Broncos game is eerily similar to 2009. The Chiefs’ season was already over, and the Broncos desperately needed a win to get into the playoffs. Two Derrick Johnson pick-6’s and 259 rushing yards from Jamaal Charles later, the Mile High crowd was silenced.\nSadly, someone else has to get those rushing yards this time.\nThe last line I saw on the Ravens/Bengals game was Ravens favored by 1.5 points. It’ll definitely be a tight game given how well Cinci matches up against us, but given they’re not a bottom-feeder team, that can only bode well for us (which still blows my mind). I’m very cautiously optimistic about the game, so I’m calling a 20-17 win on Sunday, the AFC North title, and a bye in the playoffs.\nI am a cowboys fan, but part of me wants the boys to lose just to shut jerky jones up.\nLions are one of the hotter teams in the league right now, the Pack already have some key injuries on the O-Line and with Jennings out.\nhope Staff can show why they got it wrong on the Pro-Bowl this year…not just with Manning but with picking Newton ahead of him as 1st alternate.\nThe Bucs scoring 21? Realy? No.\n@suhnami – I’m a Packer fan and I 100% agree. The Lions were very much in the game on Thanksgiving until the wheels came off, and I assume they wouldn’t implode like that again (although in the playoffs that could change – hard to predict how a team will react in the tournament for the first time). The Lions have personnel on D to give the Pack fits: pressure with 4 and play coverage.\nHey cincyhokie!! You forgot to include the JETS!!!\nIf the Eagles were the “best team”, they’d be in the playoffs. Hell, if they were even a good team they’d be in. The NFC East wasn’t particularly great this year and they still tanked. Eagles were lousy and don’t deserve to be anywhere near the playoffs.\nLOL! That helmet looks like it’s too big for Eli’s head.\nI don’t think my team is gonna even come close w the Giants this week. Our secondary is terrible, Oline stinks, bad play calling and no running game. Did I mention that we can’t get to Manning? I hope this reverse psychology works.\nJust worry about hanging onto second place, Mr. PFT.\nCommas go inside of quotation marks, bro.\nSure showed that on Thanksgiving, didn`t they?\nGreen Bay is 11-1 outdoors this year , 3-0 in domes.\nIf Green Bay rests their starters, mainly Rodgers, Lions can win. Otherwise not, unless of course some cheap shots take out Rodgers.\nYou won’t see a Ravens fan even near this site come sunday night. Bungles will beat them. They will throw the ball all over that bad secondary of the Ravens. I’m expecting a monster game out of AJ Green. Around 140 yds receiving. They can’t stop him. AFC North champion STEELERS baby…I love the sound of it! Chokemore Ravens. Watch it unfold!\nSorry Mike, Rosie sweeps your 4 opposing picks.\nEVERY helmet is too big for Sheli’s baby head… even those small Riddell’s you can get for your kids are tooooo big for “deer in the headlights” Manning.\nWE know which brother got the bigger head genes!! BIG BROTHER, BIG HEAD BROTHER!!!\nThe Raiders choke in big games. It wouldn’t surprise me if they implode due to penalties and SD puts a beat-down on them like they did the Ravens.\nThanks for the letting me know that when the ‘Boys lose they will fall to third in the division when the beagles win – easier schedule and higher draft pick for next year – oh wait – jj does the picking and coaching and ….. nevermind.\nOr the 2010 Patriots about facing Matt Flynn.\nYou could also ask the Lions about playing Matt Flynn to. Just saying.\nI think the Lions win over Green Bay on Sunday, but I think that’s primarily because the game means more to us than it does to Green Bay.\nThe Lions haven’t won at Lambeau since 1991, and this particular Lions team has been very motivated to end those kinds of ongoing ugly statistics.\nHaving said that, I think both teams will also be eyeing this game very carefully. There’s a decent chance they could both be playing each other again at Lambeau in two weeks, in the playoffs.\nAnd the Saints are winning the Super Bowl.\nBengals by 3 in a low scoring game. WhoDey!\nRavens swept your beloved Steelers. End of story. Have fun cheering against a team that quite frankly, the Steelers could not handle. They’ll be lucky to even get a third crack at the Ravens.\nhold on a sec MF, just hold on. you pick the jets and say that they’re destined to get into the payoffs…..\nTHEN you pick the broncos and the raiders…..which would make it IMPOSSIBLE for the jets to get in. what gives dude???\nthe jets need to win their game, a cincy loss, a tenn loss, AND EITHER an oak loss or a den loss to make the playoffs.\nIt’s absolute insanity to even insinuate that the Eagles are the best team in the league right now.\nThe Jests need so much help that it is more likely that a whale will grow wings than everything falling into place for them to get it.\nI hope that Sean Payton’s insistence that the Saints go “all in” doesn’t backfire. I can see Brees getting injured while Payton is trying to statpad Brees above Brady.\nAgreed…no one will stop the Saints. New Orleans is about to get its second championship in 3 years. At home, on the road…this team is the real deal! Remember, they have the best road record of any team in the NFL over the past 3 seasons…18-6…look it up! They’re about to shatter the greatest show on turf both in points scored and yardage…Brees just did what no one else could in 27 years…take it to the bank. These dudes are rolling straight to the trophy!\nRAVENATOR…You just make sure you’re back on pft sunday after Ravens get handled. Don’t you go hiding like the rest of you Ravens fans do when you lose! I’ll be here to be all over you baltimorons! 2 reasons why you will lose..1. Your bad secondary will get picked apart AJ Green…..2. Joe Flacco..he’s terrible…Steelers are your AFC North champs! AGAIN!\nSeriously ?!? I guess the pundits can never admit their pre-season annointings are ever wrong.\nHey, maybe you can get Morgan Freeman to narrate “Missing Rings: The 2011 Philadelphia Eagles”.\nThat’s good jimbo. You just named 2 of 6 total road losses in 3 years! Let’s throw in Seattle for round numbers. Now we’ve named half their road losses out of a total of 24! Now here’s your assignment. Name me their 18 road victories, I can… But I’m the teacher here. Tell me little Jimmy, I’m waiting.\nHow funny it is that the only straw you have left to grasp is another city’s team beating the ravens because your own team couldn’t seal the deal. You talked about the steelers blowing out the steelers in Pittsburg and then hid for weeks after they swept your team. Coward. Terrible Ravens secondary? They Seemed to do just fine against mike Wallace and Co this year. In fact I seem to remember a certain rookie WR blowing past your secondary to catch the game winning TD. Have fun on the road next weekend.\nIf there is a football god, both fat slob Ryans will drowning their sorrows in gallons of ice cream on Monday.\nLet me pile on one too. It’s actually more absurd the second time I read it.\n@rexryanseacrest….funny how that same straw I hang onto is the same straw you hung onto a few monday nights ago when we played the 49ers. Oh I know, act like you werent up all night worried sick..oh wait that’s right ravens fans didn’t care. Flacco didnt watch, you didnt watch… bs..youre just another dumb ravens fan throwing out accusations when you do exactly the same thing! Hypocrite. You just make sure youre back here sunday night after bungles manhandle you! Oh this is gonna be sooooo sweet!\nGet ready 49er fans..we gettin ready to invade candkestick tonight baby. Here comes the steelers fans! Let’s get this party started…#1 seed here we come! Thanks choke sooo hard university!\nRecognize that? That was you before your team choked in San Fran. The San Fran fans challenged you to eat your words but you were nowhere to be found. I actually thought the Steelers would win that night because the Steelers are a good team. I would be stupid to think otherwise.\nLook, even if the Ravens win the Super Bowl this year, you’ll still be on here talking about how the Ravens have 2 trophies and you (as if you’re on the team) have 6 …yap yap yap.

        "prompt": "The three most common weight loss surgeries are gastric sleeve, gastric band and bypass.\nChoosing a weight loss surgery is a personal decision that should be based on the amount of weight that you need to lose, current health status and long-term goals. The three most common weight loss surgeries are gastric sleeve, gastric band and bypass.\nAdults with a BMI greater than 40 or BMI greater than 35 with co-morbidities (other health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc.) usually meet insurance requirements to have weight loss surgery. You must show that you have attempted to lose weight in the past without long term success. You must also understand the importance of the surgery, surgery risks and be willing to attend pre-op and follow-up visits.\nGastric sleeve is currently the most popular weight loss surgery. Gastric sleeve works by restricting the amount of food that a person can eat. During surgery, about two thirds of the stomach is removed. The surgery is performed laparoscopically, so there are five small incisions on the abdomen instead of a large surgical incision. Patients are usually kept in the hospital for one night. After surgery, patients do have a small risk of developing a leak, but this is usually avoidable by following the nutritional guidelines from your dietitian and bariatric surgeon.\nHow is gastric sleeve different from gastric banding and bypass surgery?\nGastric sleeve is different from gastric banding in that gastric sleeve is not reversible. Gastric banding utilizes a band placed around the stomach to restrict food intake while gastric sleeve is where the stomach is surgically altered and two thirds of it is removed.\nGastric sleeve is different from bypass surgery because gastric sleeve does not have the same malabsorptive component (reduced absorption of nutrients, including fat, sugar, and vitamins) that bypass surgery does.\nCan I ever eat normal foods again?\nYes! You will work closely with a registered dietitian before and after surgery to develop healthy eating habits. You will follow a special diet before surgery to reduce the size of your liver. You will also follow specific diet instructions after surgery while your stomach and incisions heal, but eventually you will be able to eat regular foods in smaller amounts. Since you are eating less of specific foods, you will need to take vitamin supplements after surgery to help meet your nutritional needs.\nThe amount of weight lost and the rate of loss are different for each person and procedure. Most gastric sleeve patients can expect to lose 60 to 70 percent of their excess weight in one year. With gastric banding, most patients lose 42 percent of excess weight after one year and 65 percent of excess weight at 2 years. Gastric bypass patients usually lose 65 to 80 percent of excess weight in one year.\nWill I have loose skin?\nAgain, each person is different. Factors that will increase the probability of loose skin are older age, higher initial BMI, amount of weight lost, genetics, sun exposure and smoking.\nHow quickly can I schedule weight loss surgery?\nMost insurance companies require about 6 months of supervised weight loss sessions. During this time, you will learn about nutrition and physical activity. You will also use the time to develop better eating habits and a better relationship with food that will continue after the weight loss surgery.\nWhy should I consider weight loss surgery?\nFor the right patient, having weight loss surgery can be life-changing. Weight loss will help improve your blood pressure, blood sugar and energy level. After you have lost weight, you might even be able to take less or completely stop some of your medications. Not only will you lose weight, you will feel better",

        "prompt": "In Theory: What is our obligation to help the poor?\nSeveral Republican congressmen have come under fire for quoting the Bible as justification for cutting nutritional assistance to America's poor.\nQ: What's your take on this?\nQuotes from the Bible can be used to prove just about anything. As I am always very quick to point out, the book of Leviticus, which many use to support their prejudice against the GBLT community, also supports killing disobedient children. The same sentiment is found in Deuteronomy.\nIn 19th-century America, slaves read from the same Bible as did their enslavers. Indeed, Ephesians 6:5 says, “Slaves, obey your earthly masters....” Yet as a country and a larger society, we moved, and are moving, to abolish slavery all around the world.\nThroughout the Bible this specific Jesus theme is demonstrated with compassionate groups of people taking care of those less fortunate. In her book, “There Shall Be No Needy,” Rabbi Jill Jacobs asks if Americans, and indeed all civilized society, measure compassion by being servants to other servants, or servants to God. Americans are tender, fierce, patriotic and also compassionate. People cannot continue to die on the streets. Insisting that all children be born, but not that all children be adequately nurtured and nourished, is an incomplete thought process. We must use our resources to take care of the poor.\nI’d agree that Christians have responsibility to aid the destitute, but I wonder why the world thinks they have any responsibility. I mean, if there’s no God, and it’s all just survival of the fittest, then why not applaud Scrooge in his solution that the poor should just die and “decrease the surplus population”?\nNow the Bible isn’t silent. Jesus said no less than four times that the impoverished will always be. There’ll never be a time that this world will be absent those in need. Jesus also said that whenever we provide them comfort, he takes it personally, and that’s highly motivating to me. But I wonder about the world, which strives to remove Christ from every public forum, and here we’re talking about making government get all almsy with their tax dollars.\nThe world doesn’t wish to support the unproductive. Me neither, as I’m personally aware of many people who won’t work because it’ll ruin their government hand-out qualification; they live on charity and freebies at the working person’s expense. This, everyone despises; but this isn’t every case, and those people who really can’t muster a meal, and can neither do so under a roof, give us Christians, at least, cause for action.\nThe Bible does say that if you’re unwilling to work, you shouldn’t expect to eat, and there’s no limited interpretation of that. It means that when someone sits idly by, waiting for whatever, with full capacity to meet the immediate need, then it’s really on them. Proverbs 19:15 says “an idle person will suffer hunger.” That’s true, and that’s the abusive state that makes us cringe. However, if we can aid those desiring to contribute, then let’s, as “one nation under God,” teach them to fish, rather than merely give them one, and let’s make the bottom line for America black, rather than red.\nThe immediate context of 2 Thessalonians 3:10 was indeed a rebuke of professing Christians who used the imminent return of Jesus Christ as an excuse not to work. Nevertheless, it is an appropriate, timeless application of the underlying truth it teaches to require work from those who are able, instead of giving them a free ride.\nGod set the pattern for Adam and all of his descendants after his fall: “By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread” (Genesis 3:19). Proverbs 14:23 contrasts the God-ordained consequences of work versus sloth: “In all labor there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.” Every day God freely produced manna for the Israelites to eat in the wilderness, but notably he caused it to fall “around the camp” for them to rise and retrieve. He didn’t produce it in the pots in their tents. “Seek and you will find” seems to be the working principle here.\nBy all means, we should regularly help people living in poverty, especially those in helpless situations. “Let our people also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs,” says Titus 3:14. So what are the pressing needs of work-capable people who are unemployed? They certainly need immediate financial help to pay their rent. But they also need marketable skills that help others, and they need jobs. They need the godly dignity of the reward that comes from serving others.\nI have been thinking about this issue of the poor and government's responsibility for a long time. First, let me say that there is nothing wrong with the idea of fiscal responsibility. However, I must say that there is a certain meanness in some members of the Republican Party, and you see that meanness in the two congressmen quoting Scripture to justify their prejudice against the poor.\nNow I am not at all claiming that all virtue rests in the Democratic Party — but I will say that certain Republican officials have an amazing concern for balancing budgets on the backs of those who can least afford it. Are there welfare cheaters? Absolutely. Shouldn't each citizen, believer or not, show some personal responsibility? Absolutely. But again, there are those Republicans in Washington who want to dismantle Social Security. And the only reason I can think of is that those who would destroy Franklin Roosevelt's crowning achievement just don't give a damn about their fellow citizens who happen to be at the bottom of the economic ladder.\nAs long as I'm putting it to some Republican elected officials, let me also suggest that the meanness that I have mentioned is little more than covered-up racism. You doubt that? Look at what some Southern states, controlled by Republican legislatures, have done: required picture identifications for people of color who have been voting for years. If there had been election shenanigans, I wouldn't complain; but there haven't been any, or too few to make a difference. There's a meanness in some Republican elected officials, friends, and how interesting that that meanness/racism comes from some states that were once in the Confederacy supporting slavery. And then to justify cutting off the poor at the knees by quoting Scripture — ouch! The prophet Isaiah would be spinning in his grave — and so would Jesus, had he remained in the grave.\nFather God is so concerned with the welfare of the poor that the Bible contains more than 2,000 verses about caring for them. God takes our treatment of the poor very personally. “Whoever oppresses the poor insults his maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him” (Proverbs 14:31). Jesus went so far as to suggest that caring for the poor, or neglecting to do so, was caring for, or neglecting, him.\nThroughout the Old Testament, God gives instructions on how the poor are to be treated. He recognizes that calamity and disaster can befall anyone and so he tells Israel, “If one of your countrymen becomes poor and is unable to support himself among you, help him as you would an alien or temporary resident, so he can continue to live among you” (Leviticus 25:35).\nGod makes it clear that government officials are to deliver justice and assistance to the poor. “May they judge your people with righteousness and your poor with justice! May they defend the cause of the poor and give deliverance to the children of the needy....” (Psalms 72:2, 4).\nCongress would do well to take note: God has left an indelible example of what can happen when officials do not consider the legitimate needs of the poor. “Now this is the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned. They did not help the poor and needy. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen” (Ezekiel 16:49, 50b).\nI could say more, but I think God has spoken for himself quite eloquently.\nWhile we've pondered this week's question, Congressional Republicans moved on from denying food to the poorest poor to holding the entire federal government hostage in their 42nd unsuccessful attempt to repeal, defund or cripple the Affordable Care Act.\nNot that I would put it past them, but so far I haven't heard any Bible quotes to justify this hatred of a modest, market-based health insurance reform, a plan which was originally conceived by Republicans.\nBack to food stamps, I remind (and I hope some of my believing colleagues do also) that religious texts are not the law of our land.\nNevertheless, I am confident that we could find more biblical support for assisting the poor than for cutting an already minimal program providing a hungry person a few dollars a day for food, and in which almost a third of those eligible aren't even enrolled because of restrictions imposed by Republicans.\nI also challenge the assertion that food stamp recipients are “unwilling to work.” More than 30% of households receiving food stamps have at least one member employed — significant, given that half of those on SNAP are children, another 10% are elderly, and many are disabled.\nRepresentatives Fincher and Craven et al know as well as I do that not everyone desiring work has a job, and that many jobs do not pay a living wage. It is morally bankrupt to use this quote to justify SNAP cuts.\nAssisting the poor is a central tenet of the Bible and a principle revered by all major religions. We are commanded to help those who cannot afford the basic necessities of food, shelter and clothing. The responsibility to help one another is placed squarely upon the shoulders of every single human being. Individuals who are able to give aid to the less fortunate should consider themselves blessed to be among those giving, rather than asking.\nOn behalf of taxpayers, the United States government assists its destitute citizens by creating programs such as food stamps. Like many government programs, this one is not as efficient as it should be, and many people fall between the cracks of bureaucracy and go hungry. And of course there are some who abuse the system and take advantage of the inefficiency inherent in large programs of this kind.\nWhen it comes to poverty, we must recognize that the government is not the",
        "baseline": " solution to all of society’s troubles. The ultimate responsibility rests upon every single one of us to ensure that those who are truly needy are not left hungry or cold.\nI can think of some pragmatic reasons for cutting funds dedicated to feeding people, but it takes an amazing display of narrow-minded thinking to use a single quote in the Bible to justify taking food out of the mouths of the poor. That kind of biblical proof-texting is the worst form of hypocrisy that I can imagine, considering the myriad references in the Bible to the obligation of the faithful to provide for those who do not have the means to feed themselves.\nI believe providing food, clothing and shelter as the least we can do for those in need. We must go beyond providing the basics and beneath the effects of poverty to the causes of poverty. If we do not do that, we will continue to do only half the job. It is a huge task, but I believe that we can do no less.",

        "prompt": "It was the five o'clock shadow that helped give her away – the portrait was not, as it seemed, a rather grand if slightly butch 18th-century lady with a fancy feathered hat but was in fact the Chevalier d'Eon: diplomat, soldier, spy, transvestite.\nThe National Portrait Gallery has announced the acquisition of its first painted portrait of a man in woman's clothing; a cross-dresser who enjoyed considerable fame in both high society and popular culture.\nCharles Geneviève Louis Auguste André Timothée d'Éon de Beaumont, to give her full name, is one of the most important transvestites in history. She was \"a fascinating and inspirational figure\", said Lucy Peltz, the gallery's curator of 18th-century portraits.\n\"We are absolutely delighted to be able to acquire this portrait. D'Eon is a particularly fascinating and important figure from 18th-century British history.\"\nThe painting was discovered by the London dealer Philip Mould at a provincial sale outside New York last year. It was being mistakenly sold as a portrait of an unknown woman by Gilbert Stuart, most famous for painting George Washington on the dollar bill.\n\"Even in its dirty state it was quite clear that this woman had stubble,\" said Mould, who bought it, brought it to the UK and began further research and restoration.\n\"Cleaning is always a revelation and on this occasion it revealed that not only was it in lovely condition but, more pertinently, the Gilbert Stuart signature cleaned off revealing the name Thomas Stewart, a theatrical painter working in London in the 1780s and 1790s.\"\nEverything then began to click into place. \"What is so unusual about this portrait is that it is so brazenly demonstrative in a period when you don't normally get that type of alternative persona expressed in portraiture,\" said Mould. There is no attempt to soften his physiognomy – basically, he was a bloke in a dress with a hat.\"\nThe discovery was tremendously exciting, said Mould. \"We are the main dealers in British portraiture, doing it for something like 30 years and I must have sold two or three thousand British portraits to museums and institutions – but never have I come across something quite so idiosyncratic. I've never had anything which is so off-beam.\"\nEven without the cross dressing D'Eon is a seriously interesting person. Before living publicly as a woman he was a famous French soldier and diplomat who had a key role in negotiating the Peace of Paris in 1763, ending the seven years war between France and Britain.\nAfter 13 years living in London he was not inclined to return to Paris, resorting to blackmailing the French crown with a threat to sell secrets after he was officially recalled.\n\"He had information about French plans to invade England, despite the peace that was being negotiated,\" said Peltz. That led the king, then Louis XVI, making the highly unusual edict that D'Eon could remain only if he lived his life as a woman which, at the time, would have been an enormous disempowerment.\n\"It was very much due to D'Eon's own encouragement, putting forward the idea over some period.\n\"As far as we can tell D'Eon was Britain's first openly transvestite male who was able to live out the life that his gender orientation demanded of him – and he was able to get away with it, feted as a particularly brave and courageous woman.\"\nLondon society, not particularly known for its liberal tolerance, accepted D'Eon as a woman and she became well known for fencing demonstrations in theatres – dressed as a woman, of course.\nD'Eon was not the most feminine of transvestites. Aside from the stubble, she hitched her skirt when she went up stairs and was rather course and boorish. None of that stopped pioneering feminist writers including Mary Robinson and Mary Wollstonecraft hailing D'Eon as a shining example of female fortitude, someone women should look at and aspire to.\nThe painting is known to",

The Beaumont Society, which gives advice to the transgendered community, was named after D'Eon.\nWe will never know, of course, if D'Eon was transgender or transvestite but Peltz said she was clearly extremely courageous.\n\"The painting sheds fascinating light on gender in history and one of the reasons the gallery was so keen to acquire the portrait is that D'Eon is such a fantastically inspirational figure and one of the very few historical figures that the gallery can represent that is a positive role model for modern LGBT audiences.\"",

        "prompt": "In a country that is home to an estimated 6,000 elephants, the current number of these gentle giants in the wet zone areas of Sri Lanka are few and far between. Once hunted widely during the Colonial period, the increasing human population in lowland areas with the land being used to grow cash crops meant, elephants were almost eliminated from the wet zones, save a few from the protected Sinharaja and Sri Pada forest reserves. Today, in the world famous Sinharaja Rainforest only two known elephants remain, making them a rarity.\nHowever, a recent decision made by the Deputy Minister of Wildlife and Sustainable Development, Palitha Thewarapperuma to relocate these free roaming elephants to a holding centre located in Horowpothana, in the country’s dry zone has rung the death knell for these magnificent creatures, say wildlife experts and activists. The controversial move has even prompted environmentalists to call for the removal of both, the Minister and Deputy Minister of Wildlife and Sustainable Development, according to them, due to ad hoc decisions being made recently to the detriment of wildlife.\nThe decision made by Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma was his reaction to yet another death of a villager , Ulahinarachchige Podi Mahattaya (84) in Pothupitiya, Ratnapura, after one of the elephants in the area is said to have fatally attacked him during the night of May 20. According to villagers, up to date, 15 villagers have died, attacked by elephants roaming the area. With the recent death, a majority of the villagers heightened their requests for the elephants to be removed from Sinharaja. Calling a meeting with the village folk after paying his last respects to the deceased, Thewarapperuma promptly announced that the elephants will be relocated, amidst the applause of those in attendance.\nSpeaking to the media after the event, the Deputy Minister said, the best decision is to relocate the elephants to the Horowpothana holding center where he felt they would be better protected.\nHowever, his announcement has managed to upset and enrage many conservationists and nature enthusiasts in the country.\nAs eminent conservationist and Chairman of the Centre for Conservation Research Dr Prithiviraj Fernando puts it, if carried out as decided, the elephants of Sinharaja would become extinct. “It would be a sad day as that would be the end of the elephants in Sinharaja” he said.\nAccording to Environmentalist, Jagath Gunawardana the decision clearly appears to be politically motivated. “It is not a decision based on any scientific evidence or with the welfare of elephants in mind” he said.\nChairman of the Surakimu Sri Lanka Organization, Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera pointed out that while perhaps such swift decisions are attractive to the public, they are in fact very short sighted ones made by those who have no knowledge of wildlife and environment conservation. “Trying to be a hero before the public he has put the animals at great risk” the Thera said.\nGunawardana says, taking the elephants born and bred in perhaps the wettest area of the wet zone in the country to an alien environment of the dry zone in Horowpothana, known for its harsh climatic conditions would not bode well for the elephants. Firstly, the capture and transportation to the far off area can be traumatic to the elephants, who according to conservationists are known to be highly sensitive. “They are childlike and even hide among the rocks of the forest during thunderstorms as they are afraid of the lightning” one researcher said.\nGunawardana opines, it is not clear if the animals would survive the capture and transfer process itself, and if they do, more problems would follow, with them being taken to an area far from their familiar terrain. “The vegetation and feeding plants will be different to what they are accustomed to, causing issues” the environmentalist pointed out. According to him they would also become prone to various ailments such as breathing issues. Expressing his concerns on whether the animals can survive in such an unfamiliar environment he says, they may try to escape or get into tussles with other elephants in the area causing much more serious issues as a result.\nConservationist Dr. Fernando said, “The animal will not remain in an environment alien to it and will escape, and a majority of the time the animal dies from this traumatic experience”.\nMeanwhile, experts have also expressed their concerns regarding the Horowpothana elephant holding ground. “We do not know how the elephants in that holding ground are faring” Dr Fernando said. Gunawardana too says he has no confidence in the facility as it is unknown as to how many elephants have escaped from it to date. “Either way, such a place is no life for an elephant, so keeping them there will not be for their benefit” Dr Fernando said.\nWhile the human elephant conflict has been continuing from time immemorial Gunawardana says past decisions made in this regard must be revisited prior to taking drastic measures as suggested. In fact, Dr. Fernando says, most of the time human deaths from the conflict are preventable. According to him elephants do not roam around with the intention to kill humans. “The deaths are mostly accidental or due to the carelessness of the people” he pointed out. He says, it must be inquired as to how the recent death occurred to understand the root cause of the elephant attack.\nMany conservationists feel, before making ad hoc decisions to relocate the animals to avoid more deaths, other solutions could be tested to resolve the issue. According to them the animals could be fitted with GPS collars which allows wildlife officials to monitor their movements. “We could monitor their movement patterns and see how often they venture into village areas” Dr Fernando said.\nVen. Ananda Sagara Thera suggests a wildlife beat office should also be established in the area where the elephants are known to roam. While the officers assigned could then monitor the animals, he believes it would also prevent poaching and other illegal activities in the area.\nAnd if all else fails, others suggest perhaps, they could be transferred to an area in the wet zone instead.\nHowever, while no exact date has been set for the capture and transfer, Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Chandana Sooriyabandara said, as a policy decision has been made in this regard, discussions will be held regarding the possible steps and processes prior to taking the animals to Horowpothana.\nWhen asked, how suitable the holding ground would be for wet zone elephants, he",

With poachers of all sorts fearing to venture into the forest because of the presence of the elephants, once they are gone they say things would perhaps take a turn for the worse. While one elephant was captured several years ago only to be released at the request of the people in the area. However, Dr. Fernando says, sadly the sentiment now appears to be that the elephants must go so that humans may remain in lands once home to these gentle giants.",

Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States are still engaged in the conflict, while Qatar and Saudi Arabia seem to be out. Three separate regional battles among the remaining players—in Idlib, in the territory near the Golan Heights, and in Syria’s eastern reaches—will determine the country’s future.\nWhether or not the president is on board, the truth is that the United States has almost no real influence in Syria and lacks the resources, capacity, and political resolve to sustain a major military and diplomatic commitment to shape the region’s future. In this latest phase of the war, then, restraint would be the better part of valor.\nFor the moment, the most consequential of the three struggles—over Idlib province—is in its early phases. This province, in Syria’s northwest, is nearly two-thirds the size of Lebanon and is very mountainous. To the west, its high ground overlooks Syria’s coastal plain, the city of Latakia, a Russian naval base, and a largely Alawite population. To the east, Idlib verges on Aleppo, Syria’s largest city before the war and the object of a brutal fight between the regime and the Islamic State in 2016. Looking southward, the territory abuts the city of Hama, which was destroyed in 1982 by President Hafez al-Assad in his campaign to exterminate the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. In 2016-2017, villages just north of the province’s capital changed hands several times until the Syrian army secured them, apparently for good. To the north lies the Turkish border.\nLike mountainous terrain elsewhere, Idlib has attracted settlers for whom isolation is essential to survival; it’s the natural environment for dissidents. The conservative Sunnis there rejected the secularism of the Baathist regime and the heterodox Alawism of the Assad family. For decades, they have resisted Damascus and provided safe haven for religious malcontents.\nIt is not surprising, then, that one of the first firefights in Syria’s ongoing civil war took place near the city of Jisr al-Shughur in western Idlib, where insurgents assaulted a military outpost, killing more than 120 people. After four years of fighting, the Syrian regime lost control of Idlib in 2015. In 2017, as the United States pushed jihadi forces out of Raqqa in Syria’s east, survivors fled to Idlib. Their numbers were swelled more recently by men of all political stripes seeking to evade conscription into the Syrian army, which has been hoovering up all males between 18 and 51.\nIn the interim, Turkey inserted about 1,300 troops and a dozen observation posts into the province. These were meant to contain any threat to Turkey emanating from Idlib, as well as provide the country with a forward base for further operations, as Ankara somewhat unrealistically described its mission. Instead, Ankara was primarily focused on corralling extremists who might otherwise make their way to Turkey, keeping refugees from crossing the border, and attempting to filter hard-core jihadis out of the larger rebel population, even as it sustained more moderate rebels as weapons to be used against the Assad regime. Once the civil war is over, Turkey will likely aim to convert a long-term occupation of Idlib into a permanent arrangement as part of a larger postwar settlement.\nFor its part, the Assad regime has been champing at the bit to re-enter Idlib for months. Assad is determined to stitch Syria into a unified whole under his rule, and Idlib was long thought to be his next mark after victory in Aleppo and Daraa. The deployment of Turkish forces to Idlib likely added urgency to that goal, as did the strategic threat posed by jihadis. Militants there often talk about using Idlib as springboard for a perpetual battle against Assad. How militants would carry out that threat without air cover, armor, or heavy artillery is a mystery, of course, but the regime has taken their posturing seriously.\nDamascus has indicated its readiness to move against the rebels in Idlib soon, but a drumbeat of warnings from the United States, United Nations, Turkey, and others against a reckless offensive seems to have deterred the expected assault for now. From the regime’s perspective, the delay represents pragmatic restraint. A campaign in Idlib would be labor-intensive, and the regime lacks manpower. It would also be difficult—the foreign fighters, especially Central Asians, who have lived and battled in Syria for years have nowhere to go and would fight to the death. Intensive combat would push a wave of desperate refugees toward the Turkish border, which might inject unwelcome vigor into Turkish operations in the province. In addition, neither of Syria’s backers, Russia and Iran, want to be tarred as facilitators of the humanitarian disaster that most observers expect to result from an offensive. It is no wonder, then, that things have been put on hold.\nFor the moment, Turkey and Russia have reached an agreement to kick the can down the road. They plan to set up a demilitarized zone 10 miles deep around Idlib. The zone will be patrolled by Russian military police on the Syrian-held side and by Turkish forces backed by drones within Idlib. Turkey will take responsibility for moving all the extremist fighters and heavy weapons out of the demilitarized zone. How it will do so is left unexplained, but the Turks have referred to an increase in troop levels within Idlib. By the end of the year, according to the text of the agreement, both the M4 and M5 highways that traverse Idlib and are frequently cut by rebels will be open to traffic. In the meantime, Russia has promised to send new S-300 missile defense systems to Syria.\nOn its face, this is a good deal for Russia and for the regime. But whether hard-line rebels trapped in Idlib will really refrain from attacking Assad-controlled territory is unclear, as is the degree of force that the Turks would use to stop them. Implementation of the deal will entail a kind of Kabuki theater, where the Turks pretend to enforce the terms of the agreement and the radicals pretend to disarm by rebranding. In the long run, the Assad regime’s strategic interest in territorial unification and in destroying a rebel stronghold will likely outweigh the risks of an assault, and the deal will collapse. That the latest agreement makes Damascus appear to have meekly ceded Syrian territory to the Turks is probably enough to motivate Assad to proceed. Indeed, the resemblance between the situation in Idlib and the forced acceptance of Israel’s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967 must be too awkward for Assad to contemplate.\nThat brings us to the lower tip of the Golan Heights and the Syrian territory adjacent to it. This plateau is the second major theater still in play. The Assad regime lost control of the area to rebels early in the civil war. But over the past year, it has reasserted authority. Israel and Iran, however, still compete for operational freedom there.\nIsrael is worried that Iran and Hezbollah will use this area to try to establish a second front—the first being the one on the Israeli-Lebanese border—against it. In 2015, Israelis signaled their intention to prevent Iran or its proxies from digging in on the Syrian side of the Golan by killing an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) general and a senior Hezbollah official who were touring there.\nIsrael has also taken full advantage of anarchic conditions in Syria to open something of a free-fire zone. Since 2012, it has launched hundreds of airstrikes against Syria to stop the movement of weapons into Lebanon and the delivery of Iranian military assistance to the Assad regime. Over the past year or so, Israel also began supporting a cluster of so-called moderate Islamist forces on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights to prevent Iranian encroachment. Israel tried to do something similar in Lebanon in the 1980s, when it backed the Christian South Lebanon Army as a buffer on the Lebanese side of the border. The arrangement proved unsustainable, though, and led to a long-term Israel Defense Forces (IDF) presence in southern Lebanon. The IDF was withdrawn in 2000 when public support for paying the cost of the mission in blood and treasure collapsed. Maybe the strategy will prove more durable in Syria.\nRussia, for its part, has usefully attempted to bring Iran and Israel into an arrangement that would keep Iran and its somewhat ragtag band of proxies from Afghanistan and Iraq at least 60 miles away from the Israeli frontier. Israel seems to have rejected the proposal, holding out for the full removal of Iranian forces from Syria. As far as Israel is concerned, since it has nearly unfettered access to Syrian airspace and an endless supply of munitions, it makes more sense to pound away at Iran and its affiliates than to agree to a partial withdrawal that would tacitly legitimize Iran’s role in the Syrian civil war.\nThe Assad regime, meanwhile, would like Iran to stay because its forces are still useful and because Iran has been a reliable ally. It does not wish to see Iran provoke a war with Israel that would mostly damage the regime itself, however. Thus, Assad theoretically has the incentive to keep Iran and other anti-Israeli forces near the Golan Heights in check. Both Israel and the Trump administration remain skeptical that Assad has any clout over Iran, but it is noteworthy that there has not been a single strike on Israel from the region since the regime re-entered the area. Further, Iran’s response to Israeli strikes on Iranian assets in Syria has been largely confined to threats of retaliation rather than actual retaliation.\nIt is hard to know the exact reasons for Iran’s caution. It could reflect a view among regime officials that the targets of Israel’s strikes have been insignificant. Alternatively, Tehran might just not have plans to open a second front. It could also want to avoid doing anything that could diminish European support for the Iranian nuclear deal, or it might believe that it is overmatched. It is also possible that the skeptics are wrong and that the Assad regime has effectively banned counterattacks. Whatever the reason, Tehran could at some point decide that it has had enough and respond either from Syria or Lebanon.\nAt the same time, Israel cannot know which bomb it drops on an Iranian proxy in Syria will trigger the barrage from Lebanon that escalates into a devastating war. Israel is fairly confident in its ability to dismantle Hezbollah and destroy its missile inventory, although the government concedes that Israel would pay a high price for doing so. Lebanon, on the other hand, would be devastated.\nFinally, in Syria’s east, 2,200 U.S. soldiers, working alongside a much larger cohort of Kurds and Arabs under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces, have crushed the Islamic State’s combat capability. Many Islamic State fighters are still around—the battle for Raqqa was not, as the Trump administration advertised, a war of annihilation—but their ability to seize and hold territory is gone. In the process, however, the coalition wrecked much of Raqqa city, leaving the immiserated residents to till the rubble. The United States has denied funding for reconstruction, thereby contributing to conditions that favor the eventual return of the Islamic State or something equally harmful with a different name.\nNow that the campaign against the Islamic State is largely over, U.S. forces are branching out. They are currently conducting an exercise at Tanf, a city on the border with Iraq, presumably to signal U.S. resolve in its intention to deny Iran a “land bridge” to western Syria and Lebanon that could threaten Israeli interests. (Israel has already raided the area from the air.) Yet the U.S. presence is not really sufficient to control land access to Syria from Iraq, and Iranian movement across the border seems largely unconstrained. We will soon see whether the administration’s new policy of staying on in Syria for the duration leads to an increase in the U.S. military presence there and a redeployment of forces from their current staging areas in the north to the Iraq-Syria border in the south. Should such an adjustment be made, a direct clash between the United States and Iran would become more likely.\nThe other open question is whether the Kurds in the area can count on perpetual U.S. protection now that they have served their purpose in the campaign against the Islamic State or whether they should start preparing for an eventual U.S. withdrawal that will leave them exposed to a revanchist Assad regime on one side and a paranoid Turkey on the other. Presumably, they will choose to take their chances with the Assad regime, which has been fairly vocal in its invitation to parley with Kurdish representatives about the Kurds’ place in a reconstituted Syria.\nFor the foreseeable future, foreign forces will be a feature of the Syrian landscape. A relatively small number of Iranian troops, roughly equal to the U.S. presence, will remain in the area, along with a larger number of Iranian-controlled Shiite fighters. Where these young men are deployed at any given time will depend on where the regime needs bodies to stop bullets. Much of the IRGC personnel will be billeted at Syrian bases, and some forces will presumably remain as close as possible to the Israeli border. At some point, Syria’s many battles could shift east, and these militias, along with their Iranian officers, will flow in the same direction. Turkey will maintain a presence at locations along the border with Syria to defend against Kurdish antagonism and to poke Assad in the eye. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has begun to appear in public wearing military battledress, which suggests an ambition for a long-term presence in Syria.\nAs things stand, an empowered Assad regime is determined to reunify Syria under its rule. The opposition is fragmented, friendless, and ineffectual. Russia and Iran continue to back a willful and occasionally uncooperative client to further their own regional goals. Turkey has accepted responsibility for a seething cauldron of violent rebels. And Israeli air operations over Syrian territory are largely unconstrained. At this point, it is worth asking whether there is any scope for meaningful U.S. intervention.\nThe answer would appear to be no.\n“No” also seems to reflect the mood at the White House. Although the Trump administration has taken credit for the Idlib agreement, the consensus among the parties involved is that the United States played neither a direct role nor a tacit one by threatening force. Indeed, the U.S. message on Idlib has been, if anything, confusing. In early September, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said that “[Idlib] is a tragic situation, and if [the Assad regime] want[s] to continue to go the route of taking over Syria, they can do that. … But they cannot do it with chemical weapons. They can’t do it assaulting their people, and we’re not going to fall for it.” This was a classic April Glaspie moment as the administration soon realized. For those who don’t remember, Glaspie, then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq, had the misfortune of telling Saddam Hussein in 1990 that “we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.” Saddam is thought to have heard this as a green light from Washington to invade Kuwait.\nHaley, a week after her previous remarks on Idlib, said to Bret Baier in an interview on Fox News, “Don’t test us again. … Any offensive on the civilian people in Idlib was going to be dealt with,” regardless of whether chemical weapons were used. What she meant by “dealt with” is anyone’s guess, but she was careful to differentiate between an assault on Idlib that focused on jihadis and one that threatened civilians. For now, this is academic, but if the regime does enter Idlib and refrains from using chemical weapons, the administration’s options will be limited by the risk of a clash with Russia and burdened by the absurdity of a humanitarian intervention that willy-nilly benefits extremely violent jihadis.\nAlthough both U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Rex Tillerson before him laid out big goals for the United States in Syria—to pressure the regime to negotiate by weakening it, take away its oil resources until it gets serious about humanitarian relief, destroy the Islamic State, and expel Iran from Syria—the country’s appetite and capacity to do any of these things seem pretty small. Accordingly, the administration has said a hodgepodge of things including that it is not the United States’ job to get rid of Assad; that it cannot get rid of the Iranians there alone; that it will continue to focus on the fight against the Islamic State; and that it will withdraw existing funding for reconstruction activities and withhold future funding until Assad is gone. It has made no commitment to the Kurds one way or the other, and when the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons, it has responded perfunctorily and ineffectually. And perhaps unsurprisingly, actual U.S. policy on the ground reflects the president’s preference to spend as little and get out as quickly as possible.\nThis could change. Israel or Iran could conceivably pull the United States into a war against Iran in Syria. The Assad regime could commit a hideous atrocity that impels the United States and perhaps the United Kingdom and France to risk a clash with Russia in order to punish Assad in some decisive way.\nBarring such scenarios, however, the Trump administration’s derisory commitment in Syria is proportional to the United States’ actual strategic",

U.S. interests did not suffer then, except when Washington stepped on Assad’s toes in Lebanon in the 1980s, and they won’t suffer now.

        "prompt": "Saints robbed by bad call, fluke two years in a row, so what's next?\nOn wrong end of miracle last year, robbery this year ... what's next for Saints fans?\nMissed pass interference call and missed opportunities on offense doom New Orleans in NFC Championship Game.\nNEW ORLEANS – Last year, the New Orleans Saints fell victim to the Minnesota Miracle. Sunday, the 2018 season ended with the Big Easy Burglary (please, insert your much-stronger descriptor).\nGreg Zuerlein kicked a 57-yard field goal and the Los Angeles Rams, not long after they benefited from a terrible call late in regulation, stunned the Saints, 26-23, in overtime of the NFC Championship Game and punched a ticket in Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta.\nWith the game tied at 20 in the final 2 minutes of regulation, Saints quarterback Drew Brees threw a third-down pass toward the end zone and receiver Tommylee Lewis. Rams defender Nickell Robey-Coleman shellacked Lewis with a high hit before the arrival of the football, but a penalty flag never hit the turf at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\n\"Oh, hell yeah,\" Robey-Coleman told reporters after the game, \"that was PI. I was beat, and I was trying to save the touchdown.\"\nThe Saints took the lead with their third field goal of game, but a first down would have allowed the Saints to bleed the clock and possibly close out the Rams. Instead, Los Angeles, once down 13-0, used a Zuerlein kick to tie the game with 15 seconds remaining.\n\"Just getting off the phone with the league office. They blew the call,\" Saints head coach Sean Payton said. \"I don't know if there was ever a more obvious pass interference call.\"\nImmediately following the game, referee Bill Vinovich said he had yet to see the controversial play.\n\"It was a judgement call by the covering official,\" Vinovich said. \"(The timing in the game did not have an impact on the call). It is not a reviewable play.\"\nNew Orleans won the toss and got the ball in overtime, but a poor decision by Brees led to an interception near midfield and set the stage for Zuerlein’s heroics.\n“That’s a tough way to give them the ball,” said Brees, who was hit while attempting to throw a deep ball.\nThe non-pass-interference call certainly proved to be a gutting blow for the Saints, but the offensive woes the team experienced over the final seven weeks of the season were present inside an electric Superdome and contributed to Sunday’s disastrous finish to an otherwise spectacular season.\nSince boarding the plane for Dallas in Week 13, the Saints averaged 20 points per game – a far cry from the 37 points per game during the first 11 games. Sunday, New Orleans missed some early opportunities to put the game out of reach.\nTwo trips in the red zone produced just six Saints points in the first 8 minutes of the game. Will Lutz’s second field goal came after New Orleans intercepted Jared Goff at the 16-yard line but gained 6 yards in the ensuing three plays.\n“I felt like there were opportunities for us that I wish we would have taken advantage of,” Brees said.\nThe Rams shut down New Orleans superstar Michael Thomas – four catches, 36 yards – but allowed Brees to find fourth-string tight end Garrett Griffin – even the most ardent Saints fans were forced to furiously scour Google – and third-string quarterback Taysom Hill for touchdowns.\nPrior to the blown call late in regulation, Payton opted not to bleed some of the remaining time. Following a 43-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr., the Saints had the ball at the Rams’ 13 with 2 minutes to play. Brees threw an incompletion on first down. Alvin Kamara ran off right tackle on second down and",

We ended up having a 13-point lead at one time. You can't ever let your foot off the gas.\"\nAfter the controversial call, the Rams faced a three-point deficit, but still had a timeout and 1:41 left on the clock.\nThe rest of the game will forever be a blur to the 70,000 rabid fans inside the Dome who did their part. The building shook throughout the afternoon behind the strength of Who Dat Nation. Members will be hoarse and morose Monday morning. Their voices will recover over the next nine months.

        "prompt": "GREENSBORO – Gracie Gold and Ashley Wagner, Olympians and national champions both, arrived at the 2015 U.S. figure skating championships to continue a march that top U.S. skaters have made for generations, including the likes of Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi and Michelle Kwan.\nA top finish at the U.S. nationals becomes a springboard onto the international stage, where world and Olympic medals are almost certain to follow.\nThat is the way it has gone for decades, U.S. women often cleaning up at the Olympics or world championships, sometimes winning multiple medals the same year.\nBut it's not the way it's going now.\nFor an unprecedented eight consecutive seasons, going back to 2006, U.S. women have been unable to win an individual medal at the Olympic Games or world championships, the worst U.S. drought ever in figure skating's most popular and lucrative discipline.\nThere are a myriad of reasons why, starting with the shift of power in women's figure skating from the United States to Russia, Japan and South Korea. Russia in particular has enjoyed a stunning resurgence, reaping the benefits of the nation's call for its coaches to return home from the West and for money to flow into the development of young skaters in advance of the 2014 Games in Sochi, where a Russian woman won the Olympic gold medal for the first time in history.\n\"It's Japan and Korea falling in love with skating with popular champions with the perfect (small) body type, the best body type for skating, not likely to have a growth spurt, and Russia throwing all that money into the sport,\" said choreographer Lori Nichol of Canada, who has worked with skaters from a dozen countries, including Kwan and now Gold.\nMeanwhile, back in the United States, economic realities, an initial U.S. reticence toward the sport's new judging system and a head-turning variety of opportunities for female athletes under Title IX are hindering American hopes of finding the next wave of young women who can return U.S. skating to the medal podium.\nFigure skating is a very expensive sport, always has been, always will be. We'll never know if a future Tara Lipinski or Sarah Hughes was forced to quit the sport -- or in fact never entered it -- due to her family's economic constraints. The recession of 2008 certainly wouldn't have encouraged anyone sitting on the fence to try the sport.\nWhat's more, there are so many more sports vying for the attention of girls now than 30 or 40 years ago, and most if not all of those sports are far less expensive than skating. Perhaps America's next great skating princess fell in love with soccer or lacrosse 10 years ago, and never set foot on the ice. Tennis, another of those traditional and welcoming sports for girls for decades, is facing the same problem.\nThen there's the controversial, points-based, secret judging system implemented after the 2002 Salt Lake City pairs judging scandal, a system of numbers and strategy and influence peddling that the United States didn't embrace as quickly as other countries did, like Russia.\n\"Other countries kind of saw the system, took it, ran with it,\" said Wagner, the two-time national champion who recently finished third at the prestigious Grand Prix Final, beating two of the top Russians. \"",
        "baseline": "It is a very technical system so these kids are going out there doing triple-triples, triple axels, quads. … Russian figure skating as a whole is very technical (while) the United States has always been very focused on creating well-rounded, artistic skaters. I think that now slowly we are getting a generation that has come up in the new system. We are getting there. We need to have athletes who deliver under pressure. That is our biggest challenge.\"\nThe days of anyone dominating the sport as Kwan did from 1996-2005, winning nine national titles, five world titles and two Olympic medals, are long gone. The demands of the current judging system are just too brutal.\nSo young women will rise, and young women will fall. They will stand on the podium one year, disappear the next, return the year after. They will be Russian, Japanese, South Korean. And, every now and then, one of them even will be an American.",
        "llm_baseline": "We were a little bit slower to get on board with it. We were a little bit slower to get on board with the whole idea of the judging system.\"\nThe system has been tweaked since its inception, but it's still a far cry from the old system, where the judges were the only ones who knew what they were doing. Now, the skaters and their coaches know exactly what they need to do to score well, and they know exactly what the judges are looking for.\n\"It's a little bit more of a science than an art,\" Wagner said. \"It's a little bit more of a numbers game than an art game.\"\nThe judging system has been a boon for the Russians, who have won the last three world championships and the last two Olympic gold medals. The Russians have been able to identify and develop young skaters who can score well under the new system, and they have been able to do it with a level of financial support that the United States has not been able to",
        "llm_senso_medium": "The U.S. was a little bit slower to jump on board. I think we're starting to see the results of that now.\"\nThe U.S. women's drought is not a new phenomenon. The United States has gone through periods of dominance and periods of drought before. But this is the longest stretch of futility in U.S. women's figure skating history.\nThe last U.S. woman to win an Olympic medal was Kwan, who won the silver in 1998. The last U.S. woman to win a world title was Kwan in 2005. The last U.S. woman to win a world medal was Kwan, who won the silver in 2003.\nThe last U.S. woman to win an Olympic or world title was Kwan, who won the Olympic gold in 1998 and the world title in 1996.\nThe last U.S. woman to win an Olympic or world medal was Kwan, who won the Olympic silver in ",

You have to know what you're doing. Not only do you have to know what you're doing, you have to know what the other skaters are doing. You have to know what the judges are looking for.

        "prompt": "ISTANBUL — After working as an interpreter for an American security company in Iraq and enduring years of background checks after applying for a U.S. visa, Labeeb Ali’s hopes of moving to the United States ended abruptly in Qatar’s international airport on Saturday, when officials prevented him from boarding a flight to Texas.\n“I have the visa in my passport,” he said hours later, after he had stopped yelling at the airport staff and his rage had given way to despair and regret at having already sold his business and belongings in Iraq.\nPresident Trump’s order on Friday to temporarily ban citizens of several Muslim countries from entering the United States sowed panic, confusion and anguish in airports across the globe Saturday, as nationals of the affected countries were either barred by airlines from traveling or detained upon arrival in the United States.\nThose prevented from boarding U.S.-bound planes included Iraqis such as Ali, who said he had been granted a special immigration visa on Jan. 24 reserved for interpreters and translators who had worked for American forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. Others had fled war in Yemen or Syria or repression in Sudan or Iran. Taken together, Saturday’s restrictions amounted to another cruel trial for people who had escaped conflict and overcame the hurdles to win coveted American visas, only to be turned back on what should have been their journeys’ final leg.\nCountless others were left in a paralyzing limbo as they struggled to understand the president’s edict. They included Syrian students granted admission in American universities and facing the certainty that they would not be able to attend, and Iraqi or Iranian green-card holders traveling abroad and terrified at the possibility that they would not be able to return home.\nSarah Amer, an Iraqi who lives in New York, had left her daughter at home and was visiting friends in Iraq when Trump signed the executive order. “They can’t just change the rules in one night,” she said Saturday, amid confusion about whether green-card holders from Iraq could return to the United States.\n“These are people’s lives they are playing with,” she said.\nThe executive order, titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” bars citizens from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya, all predominantly Muslim nations, from entering the United States for the next 90 days. The order also indefinitely bars Syrian refugees from resettling in the United States and suspends the entry of all refugees from any country for 120 days.\nThe order followed Trump’s repeated campaign pledges to restrict Muslim immigration to the United States. But the speed with which it was promulgated — a week after the president took office — still caught those most affected by surprise.\nQatar Airways said that passengers would be allowed to travel only if they were permanent green-card holders or had visas that were exempt from the order.\nShe would not say which country the passengers had come from, only that they were from one of the seven countries named in the presidential order.\nAli, the Iraqi citizen, said that two Syrians were also prevented from traveling on his flight to Texas. In Egypt, security officials stopped five Iraqis and a Yemeni national from boarding a flight to New York. There were unconfirmed reports that Iranian visitors as well as permanent green-card holders were restricted from traveling to the United States by officials at airports in Amsterdam, Abu Dhabi as well as Qatar, according to Hazhir Rahmandad, an Iranian American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who created a crowdsourced database to track Iranian travelers affected by the ban.\nAlthough the details in the database could not be independently verified, the reports also suggested scores of Iranian visitors and green-card holders were also being turned away at several U.S. airports upon arrival.\nThe data and reports so far “suggest there is confusion among border agents about how to treat” the various categories of visa holders, Rahmandad said.\nAnd there was consternation for Iranians who received the news while on the road. On Saturday, Ali Abdi, a 30-year-old Iranian green-card holder who studies at Yale University, was in transit in Dubai, on his way to Afghanistan to do research for his doctoral thesis, but he was suddenly worried that Trump’s directive had left him stranded.\nHe had received reports from friends and acquaintances that green-card holders were subject to the ban. Abdi, a human rights activist who claimed asylum in the United States in 2011, said he would not be able to return to Iran if he was denied reentry to the United States.\n“I’ll be stateless,” he said. “I left Iran eight years ago, and I have been looking for a home. I don’t think of the U.S. as that kind of place anymore,” he said.\nAbed Ayoub, the legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, an advocacy group that was counseling citizens from the affected countries, said the majority of the calls the group had received were from people overseas wondering whether they should even bother boarding a plane. They included an Iraqi woman who was flying to visit her family in the United States but at the last minute decided to go to Canada instead.\nCalls had also come from citizens of countries that were not affected by the ban, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Morocco — part of what Ayoub called a broader “chilling effect” the presidential order had imposed across the Muslim world.\nWhen Fuad Sharef and his family landed at Cairo airport Saturday morning, they were clutching boarding passes for their connecting flight to New York and valid one-year visas to the United States. They were headed, eventually, to Nashville, to start a new life.\nBut soon after they entered the terminal, Egyptian airport authorities stopped them and ordered them to hand over their passports. They informed him that the American Embassy in Baghdad had sent a communique saying the family could no longer travel on to the United States.\nHe was traveling with his wife, Arazoo, 41; his son Bnyad, 19; his daughter Yad, 17; and another daughter, Shad, 10.\nLike many Iraqis wanting to resettle in the United States, Sharef took advantage of a program to assist Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government and American media in Iraq. Sharef had worked for Research Triangle Institute (RTI), a USAID subcontractor, for several years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, first as translator and later running a program that gave out microbusiness loans to Iraqis.\nWorking for the Americans was filled with perils, he said.

He was confident he would find an opportunity in Nashville, with his three degrees, including an MBA.\nSharef admits that he took a gamble. When he heard of Trump’s impending visa ban, he pushed their trip to the United States forward by a few days.

        "prompt": "The median American household currently holds just $11,700 in savings, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data by personal-finance site Magnify Money. Median balances (the midpoint value) are lower than the average savings rates. The top 1 percent of households by income have a median savings of $1.1 million in variety of saving accounts. The bottom 20 percent have no savings accounts and the second lowest 20 percent income earners have just $26,450 saved.\nThe average savings are skewed by high earners with more money. Some 50 percent of households have more than $4,830 in retirement, money market deposit, checking and savings and certificate of deposit accounts, while 50 percent have less than that. The top 1 percent of households have an average of $2.5 million in accounts, while the bottom 20 percent of households have an average of $8,870 saved. So while the average household has $277,670 in retirement accounts and $32,130 in savings accounts, the median household only has $72,840 in a retirement accounts and $21,000 in savings accounts.\nWhat households save the most? “Wealthier households comprise most of them, but less-well heeled households can have healthy levels of savings as well,” the report concluded. Of those households that have managed to save more than the national savings average, 59 percent are among the top 20 percent of income earners. But many less well-off families have also manage to save money in these kinds of accounts: approximately 41 percent of above average savers are in the bottom 80 percent of income, the report said.\nVery few of the 126 million US households covered in the data are average, the report said. “As of 2016, about 78 percent of households had at least one of the following: a savings account, a retirement savings account, a money market deposit account or certificates of deposit.” The bad news: Just over half of Americans own stocks, a Gallup report recently concluded. That includes 401(k) plans, shares in an equity mutual fund and/or an IRA account. Two-thirds of Americans do not even participate in or have access to a 401(k) plan, according to the US Census Bureau.\nThere is also wide disparity in saving among the various generations, based on ages and income levels within each cohort. Millennial households have an average $24,190 in savings, for instance, but 50 percent has less than $2,430 saved, the report found. Generation X households have an average $125,560 saved, but again 50 percent has less than $15,780 in savings, checking and retirement accounts. Baby boomers and older have an average $274,910 saved, but less than 50 percent of that cohort has less than $24,280 saved.\nThis is in contrast to the situation for the poorest Americans. Some 50.8 million households or 43 percent of households can’t afford a basic monthly budget for housing, food, transportation, child care, health care and a monthly smartphone bill, according to an analysis of US government data released earlier this year by the United Way Alice Project, a nonprofit based in Cedar Knolls, NJ. “For too long, the magnitude of financial instability in this country has been understated,” said John Franklin, chief executive of the United Way Alice Project.\nThe United Way Alice Project uses standardized measurements to calculate the “",

In 2017, 44 percent of people in the US said they could not cover an unexpected $400 emergency expense or would rely on borrowing or selling something to do so, down from 46 percent the year before, according to a separate report released last year by the US Federal Reserve, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 6,600 adults.",

The thought of accommodating high school scoring averages to the demands of a big-time schedule, however, is enough to make the coach keep a firm grip on reality. Which is just what has happened at the University of Louisville this season.\nLouisville opened practice with seven freshmen - six newcomers and a holdover redshirt - who had a cumulative 182.1 average as high school seniors.

Kimbro, the most coveted recruit, is averaging 5.9 as a swingman.\nSo even though Ellison has become the starting center and is averaging 13.0, third best on the team, what 182.1 high school points a game translates to is only 25.2 college points for a team that has been averaging 76.1 en route to a 6-3 record.",

Perhaps the news in the case of the country’s premier university, the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Oyo State, is that a huge admission syndicate had been operating there in the last 14 years or thereabout. It is not yet ascertained how many fake students would have graduated from the university, what is known, at least for now, is that 63 of them were discovered to have gained admission into the university in the 2011/2012 academic session alone. And this is for those already caught; we also do not know how many other such syndicates are yet to be smashed in the university and in other universities.\nAccording to Prof Ademola Dasilva, the university’s director of General Studies Programme, 19 of the fake students were apprehended in his unit within two weeks of surveillance. Prof Dasilva said he stumbled on a lead that led to the smashing of the syndicate said to have considerable network in Lagos, Abeokuta and Ibadan.\nThree serving staff of the university suspected to be involved are Isaac Ubani (Publication Unit of the Registry), Onaolapo Michael Adebayo (Dean of Science Office) and Adebiyi Omolade (Bursary). The others who operated from outside the university are Kabiru Adetunji (a non-teaching staff of Adelagun Memorial Grammar School, Odinjo, Ibadan); Kazeem Adio Olakunle; Femi Eyiowuawi and the fourth suspect, a former porter in the student affairs division of the university, was dismissed about 11 years ago for a similar offence. They are all facing trial in Ibadan Magistrate’s Court, Iyaganku, Ibadan.\nIt is unfortunate that this kind of racket could have been going on undetected in the country’s premier university for over a decade. This is a university that has produced many great minds in many disciplines, many of them renowned worldwide.\nBut the fact that admission racket is flourishing in the country underscores the undue emphasis that we place on paper qualifications. This is responsible for the desperation of many people to gain admission into the university at all cost. Nothing else could have justified the readiness of applicants to pay as much as between N160,000 and N200,000 or more, as in the University of Ibadan case, to get a place in the university, illegally.\nFor a nation that places such emphasis on paper qualifications, it would also have been expected that it would give qualified applicants equal opportunities to realise their dreams, either by expanding existing universities or by establishing new ones, or both. Regrettaby, while facilities in many public universities are shrinking or, at best static, the number of prospective undergraduates keeps swelling every year.

Due process must be followed to the end, even as Prof Dasilva must be given the necessary protection from people who might have felt hurt by his uncovering of their syndicate and have been allegedly threatening him.

The focus of the discussions will be on monetary union (replacing the East German mark with the West German mark) and on far-reaching economic reforms in East Germany.\nMonetary union would be a giant step toward unification, as it would mean the transfer of East German control of monetary policy to the West German central bank.

The four victorious powers of World War II, however, must be consulted as well as European countries - a process that Kohl has always supported.\nBonn expects a unification plan to be drawn up, in consultation with the four powers, which could then be presented to a pan-European conference, probably in the late fall.

        "prompt": "Al Bashir reportedly once led Syria’s army in the south before he defected. He now heads the rebel military council in Quneitra province in southwestern Syria near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. According to a Facebook memorial, his son Talal was killed in fighting last year.\nDan Layman, the spokesman for the Syrian Support Group, a U.S.-based rebel fundraising group, said al Bashir’s selection was a surprise. Unlike other rebel commanders, he is not well known in international circles, Layman said.\nThat would make him a very different kind of partner from Idriss, who took his post to great fanfare from the Western and Persian Gulf nations backing the anti-Assad rebellion. An East-German trained engineering professor, Idriss used his English and connections to press his Western allies for “game-changing weapons” to fight the regime. Secretary of State John Kerry was personally impressed with Idriss, a spokeswoman told reporters last year.\nNow, American officials are starting from scratch.\n“It flipped our whole program on its head because Idriss had been the U.S. client,” Layman, whose group has facilitated the transfer of $15 million in U.S. government funding to the SMC, said of al Bashir’s appointment.\nPublicly, Obama administration officials still profess support for the SMC, though no longer with the confidence of just a few months ago. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, worded it carefully Monday: “We continue to see the SMC as an effective advocate for the armed opposition.” The official wouldn’t elaborate or speak to whether the United States would use the group as a conduit for future aid shipments once the suspension is lifted; $56 million in nonlethal aid is said to be on hold.\nPrivately, however, officials acknowledge that the SMC’s future is shaky at best and so they’re evaluating a new crop of potential battlefield partners. They even hadn’t excluded the Islamic Front, a powerhouse rebel coalition whose fighters range from conservative Islamists to extremists with ties to the Nusra Front, an al Qaida affiliate and U.S.-designated terrorist group.\nAfter Islamist fighters seized their warehouses in December, SMC brigades fragmented, with some becoming freestanding militias, some answering to local military councils, and others joining newly formed, relatively moderate coalitions such as Jaysh al Mujahedeen or the Syrian Revolutionary Front.\nLayman said the Syrian Support Group launched an in-depth assessment of the potential new clients and recommended to U.S. officials the Syrian Revolutionary Front, a former SMC affiliate whose fighters have received U.S. funding in the past. Layman said the group’s leaders espouse moderate views despite being patrons of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, a conservative Islamist group. Another benefit is that the group’s leader enjoys good relations with the Islamic Front, which controls border crossings that are essential to the delivery of U.S. supplies.\nWith Islamists leading the insurgency, the more moderate rebel brigades are at a crossroads. They regained some credibility in January when they launched an operation that ousted extremists of the Iraq-based Islamic State of Iraq and Syria from many of their bases along the Turkish border.\nThe commander who launched the offensive, Jamal Maarouf, was brought into the consultations on replacing Idriss, participants said. But whether al Bashir, who reportedly commanded Syria’s army in the south before defecting to the rebel cause, will prove amenable to U.S. concepts of democratic rule in a post-Assad Syria was not immediately known.\nThe vote to dismiss Idriss was preceded by another drama as the defense minister of the government-in-waiting organized by the Syrian Opposition Coalition, Asad Moustafa, resigned Friday, apparently after the SMC had rebuffed his demand that they fire Idriss.\nDefected Syrian army officers who are living in a camp near this southern Turkish city said Moustafa had meet with them before his resignation and asked them their views of Idriss.

Key to the government's plan is a $42 billion capital spending programme, spearheaded by the Kiwibuild project, to address New Zealand's long-running \"failure to make big long-term investments\".\nRobertson has already pledged to repay debt at a slower pace than his predecessor to help pay for those programmes, but he and Housing and Transport Minister Phil Twyford are actively looking for new ways to finance new infrastructure that it simply won't be able to deliver on its own.

        "prompt": "The NBA cracked the All-Star Game last year, finally figuring out how to inject intensity and real stakes into a contest that had devolved into a half-speed, defense-free exhibition.\nCaptains, hand-picked rosters and rewards for winning mean the All-Star Game is a bigger deal than it's been in years. As such, making the roster counts for a bit more.\nIt's best to approach these predictions from two angles. First, you have established All-Stars projected to either sustain their recent levels of play or suffer a small enough measure of decline to be good bets to return to the showcase. Second, there are up-and-comers who haven't made the roster yet but who figure to get there this time.\nWe're listing these rosters as East and West, but with last year's rule tweak mixing everyone up, these won't be what the actual teams look like. They're still useful as a way to project who'll be involved before the captains divvy up the talent.\nFinally, we're making these predictions based on the assumption that fan, player and media votes get most of the selections right. The selection process is still a somewhat gimmicky popularity contest driven by social media campaigns and ballot-stuffing measures that once nearly got Zaza Pachulia elected as a starter. We're hoping meritocracy wins out.\nThe All-Star Game is alive again. Here's who'll be there.\nRegression is coming for Curry, who'll turn 31 about a month after the 2019 All-Star Game. But if you were designing a player to resist the slow creep of time, you'd probably start by making him the best shooter to ever live. Because even if the athletic burst goes, the sweet stroke (and the fear it inspires) will still be there.\nCurry missed 31 games in 2017-18, so if he doesn't earn this spot, it's more likely to be health-related than a performance issue. His effective field-goal percentage of 61.8 was the second-best of his career, bettered only by the 63 percent he managed during 2015-16, when he was the unanimous MVP. No slippage yet.\nPlus, Curry was last year's leading vote-getter in the West, and his jersey was the league's best-seller yet again. As long as there's a fan vote, Curry is a safe bet to start.\nAt the risk of oversimplification, it seems easy to bet on the reigning MVP to start the All-Star Game.\nJames Harden led the league in scoring last year and became the first player in history to average at least 10 free-throw and three-point attempts per game. With those two high-efficiency pillars supporting his bucket-getting game, Harden doesn't figure to fall off anytime soon.\nAt 29, it's possible the Rockets' leader starts to show signs of slippage. But Harden would have to fall off substantially to create any doubt about his All-Star worthiness.\nRussell Westbrook is a consideration here, but Harden had a quarter-million more fan votes and crushed Westbrook 94-17 in media voting for last year's game. That's too much ground for Russ to make up.\nNow that he's in L.A., James is almost certainly going to eclipse the league-leading 2.6 million fan votes he earned last year as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Barring injury (which we are), there's no way James winds up outside the starting unit. Even if his numbers take a dive, he's clearly coasting during the first four months of the season and the Lakers play .500 ball, James is a lock here.\nFans, media and players are all conditioned to know that if James isn't performing at his peak, it's only because he's saving up for the games that matter. He's earned the benefit of the doubt.\nThe only source of intrigue will be whether Curry or Harden get enough starting votes to threaten James' West captaincy. Don't bet on it.\nThis will be James' 15th consecutive All-Star appearance.\nEven if the Warriors spend the regular season on cruise control, Durant may still be in position to improve on the numbers that earned him his ninth straight All-Star trip last season.\nKD averaged 26.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 2017-18, which would normally be tough to top. But if Curry and Klay Thompson rest more often, and if Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston stay in sleep mode until April, somebody's going to pick up the slack. Why not the most gifted scorer in the game?\nIf the offense is sleepwalking in December and January, it's easy to imagine the Warriors leaning on Durant as a fulcrum. He can get buckets when nothing runs smoothly.\nOf course, it's also possible Durant will rest as much or more than his other title-defending teammates. Even then, he'll put up 25 points per game on high efficiency. Throw in the high profile and visibility of the Warriors, and Durant has vote-garnering advantages he doesn't even need.\nOnce Davis became New Orleans' lone big in a spaced-out, sped-up offense, he shredded the league.\nHis three highest monthly scoring averages and usage rates came in February, March and April. If we assume those post-DeMarcus Cousins months represent the baseline we should expect in 2018-19, AD is in line to average 30.6 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3.1 blocks on 51.8 percent shooting.\nNobody averaged more than those 30.6 points after Feb. 1 last season, which means a scoring title (or at least a scoring lead by the All-Star break) is realistic in Davis' seventh season.\nIf those aren't All-Star-starter numbers, I'm not sure what are.\nThough his free-throw rate dipped to the second-lowest level of his career, and though he shot just 29.8 percent from three-point range, Russell Westbrook finished better at the rim and added more treys to his shot profile in 2017-18. The result was an effective field-goal percentage of 47.7, right in line with the 47.6 percent he produced during his MVP season.\nWestbrook may be the most athletic man to ever play the point, but his rocket-fueled burst and elastic bounce will diminish eventually. With his 30th birthday in November, the cliff's edge is approaching. But this is a bet Westbrook won't fall off this season.\nThe Rockets may not be quite as dominant as they were in winning 65 games a year ago, but they'll certainly be good enough to warrant two All-Stars. Injury is a bigger concern for the 33-year-old Paul than almost anyone else on this All-Star roster, but as long as he's moderately healthy, he'll produce stats worthy of a spot.\nPaul averaged 18.6 points per game and posted the second-highest effective field-goal percentage of his career last season. As was the case for Westbrook, slippage is coming for Paul. There just haven't been any signs of it yet.\nThe vibes are concerning in Minnesota, but KAT's lack of an extension offer and the uncertainty surrounding Jimmy Butler's future with the team will have a hard time keeping the most offensively skilled big man in the game from putting up more monstrous numbers.\nTowns has never missed a game while averaging 21.6 points, 11.7 rebounds and one made triple in his first three NBA seasons. In the entire history of the league, he's the only guy in that club.\nEntering his age-23 season, Towns may just be getting started.\nGreen's 2017-18 counting stats (11.0 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.3 assists) were right in line with what he produced the year before, but he failed to make his trademark defensive impact during the regular season, prompting concerns he might have lost a step. That was until he, like so many other Warriors, flipped the switch in the playoffs.\nUndersized and not in possession of eye-popping athleticism, Green's prime may not extend much longer. The problem is, we won't necessarily know if he's slipped until the postseason—when he'll either summon his switch-everything, be-everywhere, dominate-without-scoring form...or try to and fail for the first time.\nThe Warriors are going to win a zillion games without a sweat, and Green, even at half-speed, will have lots to do with it.\nThis will be his fourth consecutive honor.\nIt's time. Blog-boy favorite Nikola Jokic has done enough to earn notice from a broader base of voting peers.\nJokic added more long-range volume to his game last year, which caused his effective field-goal percentage to dip from 60.5 in 2016-17 to 55.4. That's still comfortably above the league average, and in light of the added volume and elite passing Jokic offered, it was more than good enough to solidify him as a genuine offensive cornerstone.\nNo other center playing today comes close to Jokic as a facilitator, and his step forward as a shooter (39.6 percent on 3.7 deep tries per game) means he can't be ignored off the ball ever again.\nWe could see Jokic average something like 20 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists while positioning the Nuggets for a playoff spot in his age-23 season.\nIf that seems unlikely, it shouldn't. We've had a quartet in each of the last two seasons.\nThompson matched or exceeded career highs in rebounds, assists, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage last season, all while continuing to play some of the best wing defense in the league. As the Warriors move to a smaller starting unit that features either Jordan Bell or Kevon Looney at the 5, we could see Thompson enjoy even more space and clean looks.\nWill he exceed last year's 44 percent conversion rate from distance? Maybe not. But the worst Thompson has ever shot from downtown is 40.1 percent. There's not a lot of downside risk here.\nMitchell is the first and only newbie on the West roster. He's here because he averaged 20.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists as a rookie while assuming lead-dog status for an excellent Jazz team. Guys who seize the reins like that—especially the ones who develop new moves and expand their games during the season—generally don't fall victim to the sophomore slump.\nIf you're looking for a sleeper in the scoring title race, this is the guy. Mitchell figures to improve dramatically, adding wrinkles to his game just like he did a year ago. And the continued lack of a second go-to scoring option in Utah means everything will flow through him again.\nIf you thought last year was Mitchell's breakout, just hang tight. He'll show everyone what a real leap looks like in 2018-19.\nThe three East guards who finished behind Irving in fan voting last year totaled about 5,500 more fan votes than the Celtics guard got on his own. Not only that, but Irving finished first among East backcourt players in both the media and player voting.\nBefore undergoing knee surgery last year, Irving posted shooting splits of 48.9 percent from the field, 40.1 percent from deep and 88.9 percent from the foul line. It won't take much to get him up over the 50/40/90 threshold.\nIn light of all that, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Irving isn't a starter for the third year in a row.\nLast year's Most Improved Player, Oladipo could replicate the production from his post-break swoon and still confidently expect a spot here. After playing in his first All-Star Game, Oladipo averaged 20.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists on 54.5 percent true shooting.\nThat constituted a slump, which says everything you need to know about Oladipo.\nNow surrounded by more shooting and playmaking with Doug McDermott and Tyreke Evans aboard, Oladipo could see a spike in efficiency and even more defensive impact. He had to do just about everything for Indiana last year, and who knows how much better he could be with the luxury of a breather here and there?\nThat's to say nothing of his capacity for skill development. Oladipo added a deadly off-the-bounce trey and got himself into fantastic shape last summer. If he's back at work right now, there's no telling how dangerous he'll be in 2018-19.\nIt'd be hard to go wrong betting on Antetokounmpo to win MVP this season, which means it's also reasonable to slot him in as an All-Star starter.\nTheoretically better positioned to succeed under new head coach Mike Budenholzer, Antetokounmpo should find the going easier in an offense that features more passing, better spacing and generally shrewder core concepts. That he was able to score 26.9 points per game in Milwaukee's cramped and clunky scheme last year suggests an average north of 30 is realistic.\nBecause of his sheer physical prowess, it's difficult to imagine a ceiling for Antetokounmpo. Could he leverage his length and quickness into a DPOY award? Could he lead the league in blocks and steals? Could he figure out how to cover the distance between half court and the rim in one step instead of two?\nMuch is uncertain (and exciting) about Antetokounmpo's upcoming season. The only sure thing is that it'll be special.\nAmong players who posted up at least 200 times last year, Embiid tied for third in points per play. Only Towns and LaMarcus Aldridge scored more efficiently. This seems like a good time to mention Embiid managed that feat while posting the fifth-highest turnover rate in that same group of high-usage post-up threats.\nIf Embiid stops coughing up the rock so often, he'll quickly become the best back-to-basket scorer in the league. Not bad for a guy who also finished second in DPOY voting.\nThis might be the best way to think about Embiid: as a guy who is obviously dominant in spite of stark and correctible flaws. It's been said with annoying frequency, but Embiid picked the game up late and is relatively inexperienced. Once he cleans up some of his trouble spots, he'll be impossible to handle on either end.\nIt's convenient that LeBron James' departure opens up a starting spot for Leonard, though we'll have to see whether the new Raptor is fully healthy and committed to competing with his new team.\nAssuming Leonard is physically sound and emotionally engaged for what feels like a stopover season, we should expect the two-time All-Star to add a third nod to his resume. Leonard barely played before the break last year and still finished sixth among West forwards in fan voting. Considering the weaker field in the East, he shouldn't have a problem overtaking the reserves we'll list momentarily.\nMaybe starting the All-Star Game is an overblown honor, but it might mean something to a guy who has a lot more to prove than your typical star. Leonard needs to show the league he's the same player who won a Finals MVP, finished third in MVP voting two years ago and established himself as the NBA's preeminent perimeter defender.\nA strong first half and a position alongside Embiid and Antetokounmpo will help confirm Leonard is all the way back.\nWall's 2017-18, in which he averaged 19.4 points and 9.6 assists, was his worst in a half-decade by most catch-all metrics. He also missed exactly half the season because of injury.\nThat he's still a safe pick here says a lot about how valuable he can be, even if he's far from his best. Perhaps it says just as much about the dearth of talent in the East.\nEven if he's regressed significantly on D (voters don't care about that stuff anyway), and even if a speed-dependent player might struggle to adjust as his wheels go, Wall remains a top-flight guard who can take games over with his passing and relentless transition attacks.\nMost of the snubs we're going to list for the East are in the frontcourt, so Wall's spot is locked in as long as he's healthy enough to play.\nAs Wall struggled with injury, Beal became Washington's best player last year. Scoring at higher volume (22.5 points to Wall's 19.4) and with far greater efficiency (52.7 effective field-goal percentage to Wall's 46.6), Beal may have quietly shifted the Wizards' hierarchy for good.\nIf he hasn't, he'll still be an easy All-Star selection.\nA sweet stroke and expanding comfort as a playmaker give Beal a deep offensive repertoire. Next step: upping the effort on D, which would elevate Beal to the top tier of his position.\nMaybe this is buying into the hype. Maybe Tatum won't make more than half of his corner threes next year. Maybe we're all reading too deeply into a playoff run that seemed to signal the arrival of an early-stage Kobe Bryant clone (footwork and fallaways mostly, not so much the sneering and selfish chucking).\nBut do you really want to be on the wrong side of history if Tatum delivers on the promise he showed as a rookie?\nAntetokounmpo is the overlord of the East for the foreseeable future, and Leonard could rank right up there for as long as he sticks around. After that, there's room for another young wing to settle in as a true rising star. Tatum has the game to be that guy.\nHere's hoping Al Horford sustains his star play long enough for everyone who's been a year or two behind on his excellence to catch up and appreciate it.\nIt's always been easy to overlook the Celtics center. He's not flashy, and he doesn't produce gaudy numbers. Instead, he scores from all three levels, facilitates expertly, directs a top-flight defense and never succeeds individually to the detriment of his teammates.\nYou see the 12.9 points and 7.4 rebounds from last season, and you wonder whether Horford belongs here. What you should be wondering is why anyone believes there's a more complete big man in the East.\nHow Ben Simmons is categorized for actual voting purposes is anyone's guess. He's his team's starting point guard, but he's 6'10\" and can guard five positions. We'll call him a forward for purposes of fitting him in here, though if push came to shove and we had to call him a guard, he might deserve a spot over Beal, Wall and anyone else we've listed among the reserves.\nIn fact, if Simmons shows any kind of growth with his jumper, he may earn himself a starting position.\nAs a rookie, all he did was average 15.8 points, 8.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds, numbers we've seen equaled by a first-year player just once—when Oscar Robertson did it in 1960-61, two years before Simmons' dad was born.\nWalker has averaged at least 20 points and five assists over the last three seasons while hitting no worse than 37 percent of his threes. The only other players to do that are Curry, Durant and Irving.\nAt 28, Walker is also playing out the last year of his current contract. With just one more chance to cash in on a long-term deal, he should be extra motivated to produce this season.\nLowry, 32, is on the decline. But before writing him off as an All-Star, note that he's now playing for the most talented version of the Raptors we've ever seen. There has to be some benefit in extra help, even if it's only an extra couple of minutes to rest every night.\nAnother thing to consider: Lowry's box plus-minus of plus-5.9 ranked eighth in the league last year. So if he's starting to slip, he has a long way to fall before he tumbles out of the conversation on the NBA's best players.\nThis exercise is about predictions, which means the best players aren't always the ones forecasted to make it. If we were just laying out the most positively impactful forces in the league, Lowry would never have to settle for a just-made-it wild-card spot.\nOur predictions have Mitchell effectively taking Lillard's spot, but the Blazers icon would have warranted starting consideration in the East. If he posts another season of 26.9 points, 6.6 assists and 4.5 rebounds, he could end up making it over Mitchell. If that's how it shakes out, nobody outside of Salt Lake City will have cause to be upset.\nThe West is just ridiculous.\nButler has averaged 15 missed games over the last five seasons, which makes him a better bet than most to lose out on a berth because of health. Minnesota is also no lock to improve, and at 29, Butler could begin to regress. There are just too many foreseeable obstacles to put him on the team. Like Lillard, he'd make the East roster without issue.\nLet's make it three straight West snubs who'd deserve a spot in the other conference!\nGeorge has been an All-Star in five of the last six seasons, shot 40.1 percent from deep last year and remains a top-tier perimeter stopper. Give him Klay Thompson's spot, and nobody's going to argue.\nIt's hard to think of a better, more impactful player that fewer observers appreciate. Sure, Gobert was recognized as the Defensive Player of the Year, but he has yet to make an All-Star team.\nDespite being the reason Utah owns the league's best defense, and despite a high-efficiency, no-fuss role in the offense, Gobert is still a conventional, defense-first center who doesn't connect with fans the same way guards do. It's unfair, but if it comes down to Gobert versus Jokic or Towns, it's much easier to grasp what makes them productive.\nThere may not be enough numbers to go around between Horford, Irving, Tatum, Hayward and Brown. If the Celtics rocket out of the gates and run up a gaudy record, we could see one of these guys join the three Boston players already named to the roster.\nBut we've only seen four players from the same team make the All-Star Game nine times, and we've never had two sets of four involved in the same year. With the Warriors' quartet already penciled in, another foursome seems unlikely.\nThe Magic don't have anywhere to go but up, and Gordon could continue adding range and perimeter skills to his game (though he should still only play the 4). If everything breaks right, we could see Gordon average 20 and 10 with respectable accuracy on a moderate volume of three-point shots. If that happens, he'll push for a wild-card berth.\nConsider this a bet that his growth happens more gradually over the next few seasons.\nSomebody has to get numbers in Cleveland, and it'll almost certainly be the guy who ranked third in the league in box plus-minus the last time he was the top option on his team. Sure, that was 2013-14, and Love is a half-decade removed from that performance. But we know he can do more",

That number needs to double—at least. If that happens, and if Turner toughens up inside, he'll push for a spot.

        "prompt": "1,700 places in the United States are at greater risk of rising sea levels than previously thought.\nThis story first appeared in the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nMore than 1,700 American cities and towns—including Boston, New York, and Miami—are at greater risk from rising sea levels than previously feared, a new study has found.\nBy 2100, the future of at least part of these 1,700 locations will be “locked in” by greenhouse gas emissions built up in the atmosphere, the analysis published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday found.\nThe survey does not specify a date by which these cities, or parts of them, would actually fall under water. Instead, it specifies a “locked-in” date, by which time a future under water would be certain—a point of no return.\nBecause of the inertia built into the climate system, even if all carbon emissions stopped immediately, it would take some time for the related global temperature rises to ease off. That means the fate of some cities is already sealed, the study says.\n“Even if we could just stop global emissions tomorrow on a dime, Fort Lauderdale, Miami Gardens, Hoboken, New Jersey will be under sea level,” said Benjamin Strauss, a researcher at Climate Central, and author of the paper. Dramatic cuts in emissions—much greater than Barack Obama and other world leaders have so far agreed on—could save nearly 1,000 of those towns, by averting the sea-level rise, the study found.\nA recent study, also published in PNAS by the climate scientist Anders Levermann found each 1 degree Celsius rise in atmospheric warming would lead eventually to 2.3 meters of sea-level rise. The latest study takes those figures, and factors in the current rate of carbon emissions, as well as the best estimate of global temperature sensitivity to pollution.\nFor the study, a location was deemed “under threat” if 25 percent of its current population lives below the locked-in future high-tide level. Some 1,700 places are at risk in this definition. Even if bar is set higher, at 50 percent of the current population, 1,400 places would be under threat by 2100.\nThe list of threatened communities spans Sacramento, California—which lies far from the sea but would be vulnerable to flooding in the San Joaquin delta—and Norfolk, Virginia. The latter town is home to America’s largest navy base, whose miles of waterfront installations would be at risk of being locked in to future sea level rises by the 2040s. The Pentagon",

Several coastal cities in Texas were also vulnerable.\nBut the region at highest risk was Florida, which has dozens of towns which will be locked by century’s end. The date of no-return for much of Miami would be 2041, the study found. Half of Palm Beach with its millionaires’ estates along the sea front would be beyond saving by the 2060s. The point of no return for other cities such as Fort Lauderdale would come before that.\n“Pretty much everywhere it seems you are going to be under water unless you build a massive system of dykes and levees,” Strauss said.\nCould Greenhouse Gases Turn Earth Into Venus?",

        "prompt": "The Spanish civil war spanned three years - why has the Syrian conflict endured so much longer?\nAs the battle for Aleppo continues unabated, this intense episode in the Syrian civil war harkens back to a vicious battle for another Mediterranean city, Barcelona, during the Spanish civil war.\nJuly 2016 marked the 80-year anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict in Spain, lasting from 1936 to 1939. In July 1936, General Francisco Franco led a rebellion among the Spanish military and his allies, collectively referred to as the Nationalists, against the recently elected left leaning Republican Government.\nThe Republican government rallied its military forces to its defence, in addition to anarchist and communist militia, and a civil war ensued.\nInside Syria - Aleppo: Syria's key battleground?\nI refrain from invoking the cliched phrase, \"history repeats itself\". Rather, this piece, part of a series of articles comparing the Spanish past and Syrian present, will elucidate similar dynamics in civil wars, and illustrate how they end or why they continue to endure.\nComparisons between these two conflicts have been made before. Two prominent political scientists, Laia Balcells and Stathis Kalyvas write, \"The Spanish Civil War became a focal conflict in Europe, the ideological and military battleground where fascist and anti-fascist forces clashed while the entire world stared. Today, Syria has become the key battleground of Sunni and Shia ideologues and activists.\"\nWhile I disagree that the Syrian civil war can be reduced to Sunni-Shia tensions, their mention of how the \"world stared\" as the Spanish civil war unfolded holds true for most of the international community and Syria since the fighting broke out in 2011.\nFirst, in terms of similarities, both conflicts involved rival foreign powers which sponsored proxies in the Spanish civil war, akin to the roles Saudi Arabia and Iran have played in the Syrian civil war, just to name a few.\nThe USSR sided with the Republicans and Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided its troops and military aid to the Nationalists, tipping the balance in Franco's favour.\nFranco was leading a rebellion against the government, which would seem to make his forces similar to the Nusra Front, but in terms of military hardware, he would be comparable to Bashar al-Assad in that he utilised most of the military hardware inherited from the state to combat his foes.\nBoth these parties demonstrated their dependence on airpower, even though 80 years have transpired, and aerial technology has developed significantly.\nFranco had complete control of the air, due to the participation of the air forces of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, which bombarded pro-Republican towns. As of 2015, the intervention of the Russian air force tilted the balance in Assad's favour.\nBoth civil wars involved fighting for two major urban centres, the capitals, Madrid and Damascus, and two rebellious urban centres, Barcelona and Aleppo. The Republicans, like the Syrian rebels, suffered from infighting that ultimately weakened its ranks.\nIn the case of the Republican side, the aid delivered by the USSR to the Spanish communist militias, defeated the anarchist militias in Barcelona. ISIL has played a similar role in weakening Syrian rebels, particularly those forces who control Aleppo.\nDespite the strength of Franco's forces, in the spring of 1938 the Spanish civil war appeared to have reached a stalemate, yet a year later the Nationalists scored their final victory after conquering Madrid. That conflict spanned three years. Why has the Syrian conflict endured so much longer?\nThere are numerous reasons why the Syrian civil war continues. Differences in terms of military, geographical, and economic dynamics of the conflict provide some explanations.\nFirst, the roles of the strongest military side are reversed. Assad has been ensconced in the capital, and the onus has been on the rebels to seize it.\nFranco was invading his own country from Morocco to capture Madrid. The stronger military force in Spain had to take the capital, the ostensible seat of power, whereas in Syria the weaker power had to achieve this goal, which proved elusive.\nSecond, Spain is only bordered by France and Portugal, with the former providing minimal aid to the Republicans, and the latter aiding the Nationalists.\nIn the case of Syria, it has many more neighbours, bordered by Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and each border serves as a conduit for perpetuating the conflict in terms of arms flows and fighters. Those border nations, in addition to the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Iran, all have a stake in the civil war, and all seek an end to the war that suits their national security interests.\nThird, because the conflict has lasted longer in Syria, another difference is the political economy of the civil war.\nSince the war has lasted so long in Syria a myriad warlords, some on the government side and others on the rebel side, have taken root during the conflict, developing their own parasitic set of micro-economies.\nIt is doubtful that these parties would support a negotiated political solution if their financial base were to be threatened by an end to the hostilities.\nAnarchist and",
        "baseline": " communist militias in Spain had developed their own micro-economies, such as in Barcelona, but these were dismantled after the Nationalist victory there.\nThe Spanish civil war served as a battleground for Germany and Italy to test out their new military hardware, particularly their bombers targeting civilian centres. This tactic was a prelude to a much larger conflict, World War II.\nObservers of the Syrian civil war argue that Russia is using this conflict to try out its new military hardware, ranging from cruise missiles to long-distance bombing raids from Iran, in order to send a message to the US and its NATO allies about its new military prowess.\nAs a historian, I dislike the phrase \"history repeats itself\", because it is overly deterministic, and denies the agency to actors in the present.\nIn this case, the US, Russia, and the Syrian parties need to ensure that the bloody, half-a-decade civil does not become the prelude to a much larger conflict.",

        "prompt": "In Indiana, an outsider candidate for Senate struggles to replicate the enthusiasm that has propelled Trump and Cruz.\nIn Indiana, Republican Representatives Todd Young and Marlin Stutzman are locked in a battle for the seat of retiring Senator Dan Coats. But unlike the presidential primary, in which outsider candidates have gained traction, candidates in down-ballot races are facing challenges. So it goes in Indiana, where the establishment candidate holds a solid lead over a self-proclaimed outsider.\nYoung and Stutzman were both elected to the U.S. House in 2010. Despite their roughly equal tenure in Congress, establishment Republicans have coalesced behind Young, while Stutzman has dubbed himself the outsider. Leading up to the state’s primary on Tuesday, Young held a commanding lead in the polls. According to a recent NBC/ The Wall Street Journal / Marist poll, 56 percent of likely Republican primary voters backed Young compared to Stutzman’s 24 percent, with 19 percent undecided.\nBoth campaigns have also had their hiccups. Young was accused of not having the sufficient number of voter signatures to run for the U.S. Senate, but remained on the ballot after a tie vote by the Indiana Election Commission. And Stutzman has had to answer for a six-day trip to California worth $2,000, which was reportedly paid for by his Senate campaign. He’s reimbursed the campaign since.\nIndiana leans Republican, but whoever wins on Tuesday is likely to run against former Representative Baron Hill in November, when Democrats hope to take back the majority. Young defeated Hill in a 2010 congressional race. Also looming over the Senate primary race is the memory of 2012, when Senator Richard Lugar lost in the primary against Richard Mourdock, who then went on to lose in the general to now-Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly.\nThe gap between Young and Stutzman echoes the way other down-ballot races have unfolded this year.

But on the Republican front, it may also be evidence of a divided party, hoping to maintain its Senate majority, even as it turns to insurgent presidential candidates. Whatever the case, voters will head to the polls in Indiana on Tuesday to participate in a heated primary.

        "prompt": "On World Mental Health Day in October last year, Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton announced that mental health was a key priority. Louise Pascale examines our disjointed mental health system and wonders why, four months on, the sector is still waiting the government's promised review.\nLast month, on our Federal Health Minister's 100th day in office, Greens Senator Penny Wright did a bit of maths. She counted how many times Minister Peter Dutton had mentioned \"mental health\" in social media, parliament and press releases. This is what she came up with: tweets - zero, speeches in parliament - zero, press releases - three (the first was to prioritise mental health and the other two for World Mental Health Day).\nIn a press release, Senator Wright said, \"[Minister Dutton] has posted more tweets about the cricket than about mental health - an issue which costs our economy billions each year.\"\nOn announcing his new government last year, Prime Minister Tony Abbott moved mental health to the Health portfolio. This was met with mixed reactions at the time as many were concerned it would de-prioritise the varied needs of the sector.\nHowever, Chief Executive Officer of the Mental Health Council, Frank Quinlan, believes it could go either way. \"If Minister Dutton is able to take the issues from the mental health sector directly to the cabinet table and advance those issues...then that will be a very positive thing,\" he says. \"On the other hand, if the issues for mental health simply get lost amongst other priorities and we see it slip off the agenda, then that will be a bad thing.\"\nAt the last Federal election, the Liberal National Party did not release a mental health policy; instead they promised to undertake a review. After four months in government the Minister's office has finally released the terms of reference to the public late on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, last November the Mental Health Commission released its second annual Report Card on Mental Health. The Report Card delivers a series of recommendations to Federal and State governments on where the sector is at and where it needs to go. Based on evidence derived from consumers (those with lived experience), carers, families, the sector, and statistical data, it attempts to capture a rounded view of mental health in Australia.\nSo with a national report already delivered by the same body that would undertake the Federal government's promised review, do we still need another review? Quinlan believes \"if a review is going to actually help us overcome some of our current challenges and is going to help us make some serious reforms and investments in mental health, particularly around bridging the gap between state and commonwealth government, then yes let's have a review.\n\"But if a review is simply going to restate a whole lot of issues that we already know and is going to result in another collection of dust on a bookshelf somewhere then a review is of no purpose.\"\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) released a National Action Plan on Mental Health in 2006 and The Roadmap for National Mental Health Reform in 2012. Although the 2012 Roadmap included aspirational statements, it omitted clear targets by which government spending and performance could be measured against. COAG also did not make a submission to the Mental Health Commission's latest Report Card.\n\"We really don't know what's been spent, we don't know where it's been spent, we don't know who it is spent on,\" says Quinlan. \"In this day and age we shouldn't be waiting for data to be published every five years to get an assessment of what is happening.\"\nIt can be argued that mental health is one of those political issues that often gains a lot of attention in the media and gets money thrown at it without clear direction. Quinlan believes that with current data and set targets, funding can be directed more effectively to communities who are in immediate need.\nWhen Minister Dutton's office was pressed for what it was doing about mental health they announced $200m investment in dementia research and supporting online services targeted to young people. However, while it's undeniable that further dementia research is needed, classing it as a mental health issue may be distorting what is really needed in the sector.\nRobin Smythe is a peer support worker who, ten years ago, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She now works between a public hospital and non-government organisation (NGO) to support others in their recovery. Overall she can see the good work being done in the sector, yet she also sees first hand those who fall through the cracks.\n\"We have patients come through and there is nowhere to actually place them because they need 24 hour support,\" she says. \"There is not enough [Supported Residential Facilities] to support the demand for people who are greatly incapacitated, particularly when we talk of illnesses like schizophrenia.\"\nThe 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found more than half of those who identified as homeless suffered a mental illness in a 12-month period. That is equal to nearly 250,000 Australians. According to Smythe these individuals were often discharged to a boarding house but end up back on the streets.\n\"The other issue with homeless people is they don't have their medications. We really need to pull out the stops and find a way we can actually support this group of people,\" she implores. \"It is quite a desperate situation that needs to be looked and actioned upon sooner rather than later.\"\nTwenty years ago, Helen Keene realised her son Abner was not right. At high school he would rebel and speak out with strange thoughts. Her husband was studying psychology at the time and introduced Abner to a psychiatrist who diagnosed him at first with schizophrenia then with a thought disorder. Since then, Abner has been in and out of institutions with long periods of being well, however it is only now that they finally have his medication right.\nHer son's main point of contact with the mental health sector is a community service provided by the South Australian health department. While they have been excellent in providing care, Keene has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of peer support for Abner.\n\"You know one fifth of the population has had or will have a mental health issue, so you think that they'd get on to it,\" she says, frustrated. \"People can help each other and I am a firm believer of group therapy.\"\nThe fact that peer support workers have never been offered to Ke",

Smythe also acknowledges that when she went back into the community after coming out of care herself, it took her two years before she stumbled on a NGO that could provide her with support. Smythe knows how to get online and find help, but for those living with severe mental illness, it is not so easy.\nMeanwhile, as the 20% of Australians living with mental illness are left to navigate the system, the Minister asks them to remember \"the fiscal constraints that are facing all Australian governments.\" Quinlan hoped the review would be complete in time for the May budget to give the sector some certainty. But the Minister has set the deadline for November this year with no clear indication as to what will come next.\nLouise Pascale career began over 20 years ago in community radio, and she has since worked in Australia and the UK as a Producer and Journalist.",

        "prompt": "PHOENIX — At least 30 African-Americans are running for offices in Arizona this year, a milestone that some political observers say is a result of increased engagement and a new pipeline of leadership.\nState Rep. Reginald Bolding is one of two African-American lawmakers currently serving in Arizona's 90-person state Legislature. He and other political watchers say more African-American candidates are running compared to past cycles — and it presents the opportunity to more than double the number of African-Americans in the Legislature.\n\"I think a culmination of what's happening nationally, and what's happening locally, has really inspired people to say that this is a new day and a new era for African-American leadership,\" Bolding said, citing the successes of President Barack Obama, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\nAfrican-Americans make up about 4 percent of the population in Arizona, a state once noted in the late 1980s for its refusal to enact the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. In 1992, voters approved a ballot initiative creating the holiday.\nTuesday's Arizona primary finds African-American candidates running for seats on school boards, city councils and other local offices. Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans is running for re-election, and at least four people are vying for Justice of the Peace seats.\nIn the state Legislature, Bolding and state Rep. Geraldine Peten are seeking re-election.\nFour Democrats and one Republican are seeking to join them in the state Legislature. On the federal level, Democrat Garrick McFadden is in three-way primary for Arizona's 6th Congressional District that covers eastern suburbs in Maricopa County.\n\"You have African Americans running all throughout the state of Arizona, not just south Phoenix where you've historically had African-Americans running,\" Bolding said.\nArizona has a population of about 7 million people, but only about 287,000, or 4 percent, are black, according to 2016 data from the American Community Survey. The state's Native American population is comparable at 296,000. About 2 million residents are Hispanic or Latino and 3.8 million are white, the data shows.\nBolding said African-Americans in Arizona have become increasingly engaged in political issues in the state over the past several years. He pointed to many people of color who canvassed for the minimum wage ballot initiative that passed last year, and those who have supported bond overrides in school districts.\nMarcus Ferrell is one of seven candidates in a competitive Democratic primary for a state House seat representing parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale. Almost half the residents are people of color, but Ferrell says a person of color has never represented the seat.\nFerrell, who was the national African-American outreach director for Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential campaign, said it's increasingly important to mobilize communities of color and run more diverse candidates as the state changes demographics.\n\"If it's going to hurt a marginalized community, you can guarantee it's going to affect black people in Arizona,\" he said. \"If cuts are made to a program, you can guarantee it's going to hit the black community.\"\nKiana Sears, a statewide candidate who is running for one of two seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, joined Ferrell and four other African-American candidates at a forum in early August. She told the group one of her top priorities is helping to ensure Arizona increases its renewable energy portfolio, citing higher rates of asthma among African-American children. The commission regulates electric utilities, water companies, railroad safety and securities.\nSears says she was the first African-American elected to the school board of the state's largest school district in Mesa. She hopes that her statewide candidacy can inspire others to run for office, regardless of their background.\n\"I don't want to be that anomaly. I don't want to be that unique,\" she said. \"After I've run and more have come along, I can say 'Oh, when we talk about that first, I was the first of the next 20 who are now sitting in those positions.'\"\nThe majority of African-Americans running for office are Democrats. State Democrat chair Felecia Rotellini says the party has worked to reach out to communities of color across the state by locating offices in communities like south Phoenix, south Tucson and Nogales.\n\"I believe that's one of our greatest advantages as a party, that we are so inclusive that everybody has a voice,\" she said.\nIn the Republican primaries, Walter Blackman, a military veteran, is seeking a state House seat in a",

Blackman said he was motivated to seek office in Arizona as a way to continue his public service and provide strong leadership for his community.\n\"I believe everyone wants their family safe, they want their kids to have a good education, and you want to live in a community that's safe,\" he said. \"I don't think it really matters if there's an 'R' or a 'D' behind your name.\"",

Local wolf advocate and tracker Natalie Ertz said the above wolf was one killed by Idaho Wildlife Services agents Wednesday in response to a depredation at the Flat Top Ranch near Carey.\nThree wolves were killed by federal Wildlife Services on Flat Top Ranch near Carey on Wednesday in response to a series of reported depredations.\nTodd Grimm, Western District manager for Idaho Wildlife Services, said a control order had been issued on the pack after the wolves attacked and killed a calf at the Flat Top Ranch on Saturday night.\nNo specific number of kills was assigned, but agents killed three black wolves on the property early Wednesday. Grimm said he wasn't certain how old the wolves were, but said none of the ones killed were this year's pups nor the pack's lone radio-collared female.\n\"A 2-year-old wolf looks like an 8-year-old wolf from the air,\" he said.\nLandowner and rancher John Peavey said the wolf pack attacked and killed one of his calves on Saturday night. Four sheep were originally suspected killed by wolves, but were later confirmed as coyote prey.\n\"[Wolves] have killed numerous animals all summer,\" Peavey said. \"Once they start eating beef and lamb, I think they're hooked.\"\nPeavey has been an outspoken skeptic of the nonlethal methods promoted by wolf advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife, and Tuesday accused the wolf pack of crossing an electric fence and killing four sheep despite the guard dogs that were present both nights.\n\"Guard dogs are pretty well intimidated by several wolves,\" he said.\nWolf advocate and tracker Natalie Ertz said Tuesday she wasn't convinced the livestock deaths were due to wolves. The area is home to coyotes and bears as well as wolves, and Ertz said she heard the pack roughly eight miles away from the Peavey ranch just hours before the reported depredations occurred.\nThough wolves can trot at speeds up to 10 miles per hour, Ertz said, it's \"unlikely\" that the wolves made the trek either night.\n\"There's no third-party verification that the depredation was actually a wolf,\" she said. \"There should be an objective third party involved.\"\nGrimm said the calf depredation was confirmed by a Wildlife Services agent on the scene.\n\"This was pretty obvious, especially as the collared wolf was standing right there,\" Grimm said.\nGrimm confirmed Thursday afternoon that the four sheep were killed by coyotes, four of which were killed by service officials Wednesday. Peavey had several more sheep attacked on Wednesday night, though Grimm could not confirm if the sheep were attacked by wolves.\nGrimm said the pack's radio-collared female had been tracked from a pack in Fairfield. The wolf survived the control order, along with at least one other adult and an estimated three to four pups.\nAs for the origin of the remainder of the wolves, Grimm said he wasn't sure.\n\"They may be remnants of the Phantoms, I don't know,\" he said, referring to the former Phantom Hill Pack that resided in the northern Wood River Valley.\nAccording to Ertz, the pack was likely the same one that had been involved in depredations at Cove Ranch south of Bellevue in early June. A control order had been issued after that incident, but no wolves were killed at that time.\nThis is the third control order that the pack's alpha female has survived. Ertz said the female has survived three coyote traps as well, is missing two toes on one foot and has a severe injury on another, causing her to limp.\nErtz and Suzanne Stone, spokeswoman for Defenders of Wildlife, agreed that the survival of the female gives the pack a better shot at survival, though the impact of the three deaths will be a shock to it.\n\"We're talking half of the pack most likely gone,\" Ertz said. \"It's absolutely devastating to the pack dynamic. When a pack loses half of its members, they're way more likely to pick easy prey.\"\n\"Sometimes when you get a heavy hit on a pack like this, the pack tends to disintegrate,\" Stone said. \"I don't know how they are going to respond to it.\"\nThough Grimm was reluctant to say whether more wolves would be killed, he did say Wildlife Services would not kill the radio-collared female and likely would not carry out any more lethal controls.\n\"With where we are in the grazing season and the hunting season, unless we get something in the next couple of days, we're probably going to be done,\" he said.\nBut three wolf deaths won't make up for the death of Peavey's sheep, Peavey said Wednesday.\n\"Someone offered me money for the animals we lost,\" he said. \"I told this person, that's not the point. We love these animals",
        "baseline": ", and we go through great lengths to keep them happy and healthy and alive.\"\nThe first reported wolf kill of the 2011-12 hunting season has been filed, said Idaho Department of Fish and Game Officials Thursday. The wolf, a black male, was shot in the Island Park Zone in eastern Idaho on the first day of the hunt, Aug. 30. No wolves have been killed so far in the Southern Mountains Zone, which encompasses the Wood River Valley. Niels Nokkentved, spokesman for the department, said no other wolf kills have been reported so far, but hunters have 72 hours to report a successful hunt. \"It doesn't mean they haven't been killed, they just haven't been reported,\" he said. \"There could have been a hundred of them killed and we just don't know it.\" According to Nokkentved, the number of wolf tags sold has skyrocketed to 9,048 resident tags and 655 non-resident tags as of Thursday morning.",

        "prompt": "This week, more than 100 newspapers will join forces in a coordinated effort -- spearheaded by the editors of the Boston Globe -- to editorialize against President Trump's attacks on the press. They're well within their rights to do so; intensely negative presidential rhetoric directed at the news media can be corrosive, especially when some of those broadsides cross a line into harmful demagoguery (\"enemy of the people\"). Even if Trump is more or less engaged in a self-serving performance and exaggerating for dramatic effect, every president's words matter. It's reasonable for journalists to push back against the normalization of over-the-top salvos against their profession, even if 'ganging up' to offer a stern collective lecture is unlikely to change minds -- and, in fact, plays directly into Trump's narrative of bias and unfair besiegement.\nBut without excusing some of his worst excesses, Trump does have a point: The media is exceptionally biased against him, resulting in extraordinarily and relentlessly negative coverage. Their eagerness to criticize Trump is abundantly apparent, too often resulting in sloppy, lazy and self-defeating errors. Rather than engaging in consistent introspection about why Trump's vitriolic criticisms resonate with so many Americans, many in the press congratulate themselves and each other, with some even grousing that Trump is treated too leniently. But as Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum posited on my radio show on Friday, are any mainstream media outlets suffering under the Trump administration? Overall, ratings, subscriptions, and clicks are all up, across the board. And what freedoms have actually been curtailed?

I wanted it to feel not laboured, not contrived.\nAs part of that immersive approach Kitty researches her material thoroughly.\n‘What I’ve realised I’ve been writing more and more songs is that I love treating each song like a project in itself. Whether it’s a simple or complicated song. I love diving into it and finding a back-story.\nAh yes, Sea Silk, the album’s centrepiece. How did she come across the story of Chiara Vigo, the last of the sea silk seamstresses?\n‘It was an internet find, really. I’m quite interested in textiles and knitting, and a friend sent me the story saying this sounds like it’s up your street. So I read it and started going down the internet rabbit warren. I was so amazed by the whole thing that I couldn’t help putting something together.\nAnd Chiara is said to be the last of her line?\nKitty uses the sounds of them talking and of her weaving as backing for the track, and it’s not the only time on the album she uses field recordings.\n‘That was something I definitely wanted to do from the very beginning. We set off about the place doing these recordings with a portable microphone – I really wanted to feature some of the places and people that inspired the songs, to make it more of a collaborative process between me and them, and to play tribute to those people and places in the songs.\n‘We did it on several songs - there’s one a traditional song from [her native] Somerset called Morgan’s Pantry, the eerie one. It’s about these sea creatures which are part of Somerset folklore and live in the Bristol Channel and lure sailors in to the mud and rocks.

        "prompt": "A Home Run in \"Touching Home\"\nDavid Moir Clint (Noah Miller), Charlie (Ed Harris) and Lane (Logan Miller) in a field of broken dreams.\n\"The world breaks everyone,\" Ernest Hemingway wrote. \"And afterward many are strong in the broken places.\" Touching Home is a film of strength because it will break your heart, mend it and break it again.\nIt's no coincidence that Touching Home opens at Flicks on Father's Day weekend. It is a movie about the difference between being a father and being a dad and how that redefines two sons' love for their father. It is a film that considers the surest measures of a man.\nThe behind-the-scenes story of how Touching Home made its way to the screen would make a pretty good movie itself. Identical twin brothers Logan and Noah Miller had no contacts, no experience and no money. Yet 17 credit cards later, they had lured a cast and crew (boasting a combined 11 Academy Awards and 26 nominations) and had written, produced, directed and starred in one of the best movies of the year. Rumor has it that the brothers Miller ambushed Ed Harris in a San Francisco alley.\n\"They were talking nonstop,\" Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle. The Millers laid their laptop on a garbage bin and showed Harris a makeshift trailer for the proposed film.\n\"They told me about their dad and said I was the only guy to do this,\" Harris told the Chronicle.\nHis unflinching portrait of Charlie Winston, the character based on the Millers' father, validates the brothers' persistence. And Harris shouldn't make any plans for Feb. 27, 2011: This performance will likely earn Harris his fifth Oscar nomination.\nCasting themselves as leads in their own movie could have proven disastrous for the Miller twins, but their performances are tested by nuance and passion with equal measure. The story follows them from their childhood dreams of playing professional baseball to disappointment in returning to their Northern California hometown of Fairfax to work in the same stone quarry as their failure of a father.\nThis is no simple memoir. The Millers' story takes no prisoners and their journey is redemptive but painful. By the way, these guys can play ball. Hollywood has time and again cast leading men (Robert Redford, Kevin Costner, Gary Cooper) who are embarrassingly inept at baseball to play baseball heroes. But the Millers can throw and field like pros.\nBut this is Harris' movie. His portrayal of the alcoholic Charlie is never formulaic. Broken and bowed",

He knows the consequences of his addiction but never understands them, and even when he scrubs himself clean, he's bathed in shame and disappointment. It is a master class in acting.\nThe supporting cast offers additional surprises. The always reliable Robert Forster plays the local constable with a gentle touch. Brad Dourif plays the boys' simple Uncle Clyde, in his best performance in decades. And then there's the big-screen debut of Ishiah Benben as Logan's romantic interest.\nBut maybe the best co-star of Touching Home is the cinematography. Director of photography Ricardo Jacques Gale frames rural Northern California with beauteous care: Scenes are lit with warm twilights and actors are bathed in shadows of late summer. Touching Home always feels and looks authentic and I can't wait to see again--even though it already broke my heart once.",

As with other dash cams, Thinkware includes everything you need to set it up in your car and start recording right away.\nThere's a long power cable, with plugs into a 12V socket, clips to attach it along the edges of the windshield, a windshield mount for the F800 Pro, spare adhesive tape, and, on top of all this, there is also a microSD card included. Mine came with 16GB of memory. If your PC or laptop does not support microSD cards, you can use the SD or USB adaptors included in the box.\nThe F800 Pro is super easy to install, as you would expect. Based on my experience, the best place to install it is behind your rear-view mirror, where it's out of sight. That location is also great for getting the best view out.\nBefore removing the tape from the adhesive mount, I recommend powering up the F800 Pro and hooking it up to your smartphone first. With the app, you can use the viewfinder to align it just right with the edges of the hood and see whether there's anything blocking the view out through the windshield.\nThe cable that comes in the box is long enough so that you can route it nicely underneath the dashboard. If you only have a single 12V socket in the front and need to charge a smartphone or another device while driving, picking up a multiport charger is a good idea.\nThe F800 Pro is a set it and forget type of affair. It's designed so that it gets our of your way, as it starts recording automatically when plugged in. If you need to make changes to the settings, you will have to use the mobile app. Once you have everything set up just right, there's no need to tinker with it.\nIt's fairly compact too, though not the smallest camera in Thinkware's lineup, and it holds up very well over time. Since I've received it, I've had zero issues. The mount is great as well, sticking nicely to the windshield months after installing it.\nThe F800 Pro can also be used with a 24V socket, in case you are wondering. The adapter in the box will make the switch automatically, which is a nice touch.\nThere are a couple of really useful features on the F800 Pro. For instance, it comes with a built-in GPS, so you can see where you've been and, like mentioned in the beginning of this article, track down your car when you need to.\nThis also lets you have the actual speed of your vehicle embedded in the video. That's something that can be turned off if you want.\nThe same goes for the voice recording functionality. It can come in handy at times, but I prefer to have it off in the majority of the time. The good news is that it can be easily toggled on and off using a dedicated button on the F800 Pro.\nThe dash cam also lets you easily format the microSD card on the go.

        "prompt": "The University of California system is expected to enroll a record number of out-of-state students this fall — and will receive millions of dollars in return.\nMore than a fifth of all UC freshmen will come from such places as Texas, Washington, China and India and each will pay an additional $23,000 in tuition, providing the system with an estimated $400 million in extra revenue that officials say helps support the education of Californians.\nThe out-of-staters will include incoming UCLA freshman Bridget Bruggeman, who passed over her home state school, Indiana University, and other colleges that accepted her.\n\"Being from the Midwest, there is definitely an idea of California as a place where you can dream as big as you want to. That's something I was very drawn to,\" said the 18-year-old, who intends to major in international development studies and Spanish.\nHer family decided UCLA was worth the extra cost, which will mean tuition about three times what it would have been for her at Indiana University.\n\"It definitely would have been less expensive to go to I.U., but I don't think I would have been as happy,\" said Bruggeman, who attended a recent orientation program at UCLA.\nDecisions like that are more frequent as students from outside California and the United States for the first time will constitute more than 20% of freshmen, according to preliminary data for the fall.\nAmong the freshman classes at the nine UC undergraduate campuses, the highest percentages from out of state are at UCLA, 30.1%; UC Berkeley, 29.8%; and UC San Diego, 28.4%.\nFollowing other states, the UC system began aggressively increasing the numbers of non-California undergraduates five years ago to offset reductions in state support and a freeze on in-state tuition.\nAlthough critics contend it hurts Californians and reduces political support for the campuses, UC officials insist no California residents are being pushed out to make room for these students. The $23,000 non-Californians pay on top of the regular $12,192 tuition will provide about 6% of UC's core educational budget and help maintain classes and financial aid for Californians, administrators say.\nStudents from outside California have mixed reactions toward the extra tuition, influenced by family resources and educational quality in their home states. Many are grateful to attend a prestigious public institution such as UCLA or UC Berkeley and still pay less than at a private university. Others feel strained and regretful, facing large debt they might have avoided.\nDuring a break at UCLA's freshman orientation, Eric Rosenbower of Greensboro, N.C., said the surcharge is reasonable because in-state residents have paid \"their hard-earned money\" in taxes to support UC.\nA math and economics major, Rosenbower, 18, could have gone to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at much lower cost. But he was attracted to the diversity of UCLA's student body and the wider opportunities that Los Angeles can offer. \"I think it will pay off in the long run.... It's a good investment in my education,\" he said.\nPlus, he said, \"going across the country is going to make me grow a lot faster than if I stayed close to home.\"\nUCLA economics major Farhan Mithani, who grew up outside Houston and passed up the University of Texas at Austin, feels differently.\nHe receives some financial aid at UCLA, but officials say eligible students such as him generally receive much less than in-staters and usually do not get help to pay the additional tuition.\nMithani, 21, estimates that he will owe $120,000 in student loans by his graduation next year. Now he said he wishes he had stayed in Texas and been debt-free even though he said UCLA \"is a great school.\"\nUC, he said, uses \"out-of-state students as a kind of bank. And I think it's wrong because I have no control over where I grew up.\"\nUtkarsh Pandey, 20, came to UCLA from Gurgaon, India, to study materials science and engineering. UCLA, he said \"has given me educational, professional, and cultural experiences that I don't feel I could've gotten in India or any of UCLA's rival schools in the U.S.\"\nAs an international student, he does not qualify for UC financial aid, and his family is paying all costs. Charging non-Californians so much extra, he complained, is \"hypocritical in today's day and age of egalitarianism.\"\nAccording to recent statistics, 3,691 students from other states have said they will enroll as UC freshmen, up 389 from last year, and 5,412 international students have indicated that they will attend, 662 more than last year.\nWith their strong reputations, some flagship public universities such as UCLA do not have to worry about large surcharges scaring away applicants from other states, said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Assn. of State Colleges and Universities. \"They can absolutely compete on brand strengths rather than price.\"\nAnd more families these days appear to listen to their children's' \"emotional layer\" of wanting to attend a college far from home, Nassirian said.\nUntil 1993, it was easy to establish California residency within a year or so and then pay the lower tuition. But UC rules were tightened so that current students must prove financial independence for at least two prior years, among other things, to gain resident status.\nIn addition, Handel noted that UC requires that nonresidents have stronger academic records for admission. Last year, on average Californians admitted to UC had a 3.61 grade-point average in high school and a 1822 SAT score, while Americans from other states had a 3.76 GPA and",
        "baseline": " scored 175 points higher on the SAT; international students had a 3.71 GPA and scored 105 points higher on the SAT, according to a UC study.\nNonresidents earned slightly higher grades in their first year but had a somewhat higher dropout rate, which officials say could be caused by homesickness and financial pressures.\nVandan Kasar of Bellevue, Wash., turned down the University of Washington and other colleges in favor of UCLA, where she is entering her third year. Kasar, 20, a human biology and society major, said her family feels a financial strain because she receives no financial aid. And she said she sometimes misses home when California classmates can more easily visit their families.\nStill, she said, she has no regrets.\n\"I don't know if I am able to put a price tag on all the different experiences I've had here,\" she said. \"Besides the academics, I'm gaining life skills that make it worthwhile in the long run.\"",

Of those citing that reason, 56 per cent were female.\nAlmost one in three say they argue with their partner over savings, with a surprisingly low 13 per cent saying their \"partner's bad saving habits\" would be the main reason they wouldn't open a joint account.\nGen Xs could be more wary about sharing their finances with their partner because they are more risk averse.\n\"Australians within this age bracket [35-to-44 year olds] are likely to have more to lose than those of a younger age group and therefore they're more conscious of protecting the assets and income they've acquired through hard work,\" says Bruce Burns, senior lecturer for the School of Psychology at Sydney University.\nTwo Gen Xers who share all their finances are Glen and Jo-anne McAnally, both primary school teachers who married 15 years ago.\nThey have a joint account because it was a condition of their Teachers Mutual Bank mortgage but also have their own accounts.\nUnusually, they share these as well.\n\"We own separate accounts but we're both fully aware of who's got what. We share passwords and",

        "prompt": "On the eve of the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, the revelation – via a WikiLeaks document release – that the Democratic party actively campaigned against Bernie Sanders has shaken up a party that had hoped to put on a unified front against the Republicans and Donald Trump. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman who serves as the head of the Democratic National Committee, has said she will resign in the wake of these allegations.\nMy question about all this is: what exactly did Wasserman Schultz do wrong?\nWhile Bernie Sanders supporters are crowing victory and filling social media with articles about the DNC’s malfeasance, there is a fundamental point that everyone seems to be ignoring: Bernie Sanders is barely a Democrat.\nImagine you live in a small town. Let’s call it Rooseveltville. You’re very friendly with the folks who live in the next town over – Londontown. You invite them to summer barbecues; your kids compete on the same swim team. But there are fundamental differences between the two towns, and most people of Rooseveltville aren’t rushing to buy property in Londontown.\nThen one charismatic politician from Londontown, Bernie Sanders, buys a small parcel of land in Rooseveltville with the express purpose of having a local address so he can run for mayor. He wants to make your town just like his town. His ardent supporters are suddenly everywhere in Rooseveltville, campaigning hard for his leadership.\nThe citizens of Rooseveltville are, naturally, aghast. Who is this interloper? Sure, they like a lot of his ideas. In truth, many of them wish Rooseveltville was a little bit more like Londontown, because sometimes it seems like without a jolt of progressive energy, they’ll turn into that town on the other side of the river, Trumpsylvania.\nBut the fact remains: Bernie Sanders isn’t from Rooseveltville, and the town’s political elite do all they can to defeat his candidacy.\nI find it hard to believe that in the 16 months since Bernie Sanders first announced his candidacy, the world seems to have forgotten the fact that he was up until that moment an independent and “self-described socialist”.\nThat statement doesn’t seem very damning. Like it or not, the system is designed to reward fealty to the party. Hillary Clinton has been a figure in Democratic politics since her husband’s first term as Arkansas governor in 1978; beginning with her prominent role as first lady for eight years – modeled on Eleanor Roosevelt – Clinton launched herself into a leadership role within the party. Is it any wonder that Wasserman Schultz and the DNC would actively work to reward that in the face of an insurgent campaign run by Sanders?\nThere are many Sanders supporters who take these email revelations as just another sign that politics is rigged. But guess what? Politics has been rigged since Thomas Jefferson and John Adams first faced off in 1796. Not only did both men’s surrogates denigrate the other side",

But when William Jennings Bryan mounted his dark-horse candidacy for president in 1896, he did so from within the party. When the Democrats nearly split in half in 1924, it was because of factionalism within the party (over the KKK of all things). The Democrats have long been pulled between their conservative and liberal impulses, and there’s no reasons progressives can’t push the party to the left. Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has already campaigned to get rid of superdelegates, and that’s a good start.

This transformation was well under way a few decades ago but symbolically culminated with the election of a black man as president of the United States of America. A black man, mind you, whose legitimacy as an American, never mind as our president, was questioned every single step of the way—especially by Donald Trump—because the threat his power represented to the America’s long status quo was literally unacceptable.\nAt the same time, culture transformed as well. There are so many examples of this, but I think there’s a reason Beyoncé is called queen—her ascendance to the top of America’s pop culture throne culminates this change. Following the release of Beyoncé’s black power anthem “Formation,” Saturday Night Live produced a sketch in which white fans reacted with horror to the realization that Beyoncé is black.\n“Maybe the song isn’t for us,” one white person in the sketch remarked with surprise.\n“But usually everything is!” replied another white person.\nAnd there you have it: In the history of the United States, everything has been made for white people, particularly politics, the economy and culture. Suddenly that’s no longer the case and some people are resentful. Enter Trump, whistling for all the dogs to hear.\nIt was Trump who said that Black Lives Matter is “divisive” while insisting that he, a white man born into wealth, is the one who can understand real discrimination because of how he’s been treated in the campaign.\nEven Trump’s insistence that voting is “rigged” is a dog whistle, coming at a time when many white conservatives who believe in the myth of voter fraud have watched so-called voter ID laws be struck down as infringements on the voting rights of people of color.\nTrump broadcasts a certain historical perspective of politics, one especially fanned and exploited by Republicans, that implicitly suggests to white Americans they are getting a raw deal in the face of rising opportunity for those who are not white Americans. Once upon a time, most white Americans supported the government programs of the New Deal-era that created broad opportunity and advancement for white Americans in the wake of the Great Recession. Black Americans were generally excluded from such programs. In the 1960s, when Civil Rights protesters pressed for equality as government moved to make public policy and benefits more inclusive, conservatives saw an opportunity. Republicans like George Wallace and Nixon, who actually had been racial moderates relatively speaking, realized that they could win the then-determinative white vote and reduce support for otherwise wildly popular government programs by convincing white Americans that government was actually unfairly helping people of color.\nThe number one most important book for everyone to read this election year is Ian Haney López’s “Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class.” Haney López examines the deep, dark history of racial dog whistle politics—there was Richard Nixon, whose chief counsel said, “subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon’s statements and speeches;” Ronald Reagan, who ran against “welfare queens” in Chicago; and Bill Clinton, who launched racially coded attacks against welfare and “super predators.” But the metaphor of the dog whistle is because such racial coding is silent, plausibly deniable. As Haney López writes, dog-whistling “constantly emphasizes racial divisions, heatedly denies that it does any such thing, and then presents itself as a target of self-serving charges of racism.” Thus you have Donald Trump constantly portraying himself as the victim of “political correctness” and",

According to Donald Trump, discrimination past and present against communities of color or immigrants or women isn’t a real thing. But discrimination against him, and people—implicitly white people—just like him is very much real.\nDog whistle politics “portray nonwhites as threats and whites as imperiled,” writes Haney López. Ergo, a perennially self-pitying presidential candidate who attacks Mexican immigrants as rapists, demonizes all Muslims and derides women. The most worrisome part? Though Trump himself is a political disaster, his method is tried and true, a proven way to win over resentful white voters—and perhaps whistle himself into the White House.",

        "prompt": "Facebook’s leaders seriously discussed selling access to user data — and privacy was an afterthought.\nFor example, Facebook gave Amazon extended access to user data because it was spending money on Facebook advertising and partnering with the social network on the launch of its Fire smartphone. In another case, Facebook discussed cutting off access to user data for a messaging app that had grown too popular and was viewed as a competitor, according to the documents.\nAll the while, Facebook was formulating a strategy to publicly frame these moves as a way of protecting user privacy.\nBut the documents show that behind the scenes, in contrast with Facebook’s public statements, the company came up with several ways to require third-party applications to compensate Facebook for access to its users’ data, including direct payment, advertising spending and data-sharing arrangements. While it’s not unusual for businesses that are working together to share information about their customers, Facebook has access to sensitive data that many other companies don’t possess.\nFacebook ultimately decided not to sell the data directly but rather to dole it out to app developers who were considered personal “friends” of Zuckerberg or who spent money on Facebook and shared their own valuable data, the documents show.\nAbout 400 of the 4,000 pages of documents have previously been reported by other media outlets, and also by a member of the British Parliament who has been investigating Facebook’s data privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, this cache represents the clearest and most comprehensive picture of Facebook’s activities during a critical period as the company struggled to adapt to the rise of smartphones following its rocky debut as a public company.\nThe thousands of newly shared documents were anonymously leaked to the British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, who shared them with a handful of media organizations: NBC News, Computer Weekly and Süddeutsche Zeitung. Campbell, a founding member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, is a computer forensics expert who has worked on international investigations including on offshore banking and big tobacco. The documents appear to be the same ones obtained by Parliament in late 2018 as part of an investigation into Facebook. Facebook did not question the authenticity of the documents NBC News obtained.\nThe documents stem from a California court case between the social network and the little-known startup Six4Three, which sued Facebook in 2015 after the company announced plans to cut off access to some types of user data. Six4Three’s app, Pikinis, which soft-launched in 2013, relied on that data to allow users to easily find photos of their friends in bathing suits.\nFacebook has acknowledged that it considered charging for access to user data. But Facebook has challenged the significance of those discussions, telling the Wall Street Journal last year and NBC News this month that the company was merely mulling various business models.\nFacebook has also repeatedly said that the documents had been “cherry-picked” and were misleading. Facebook reiterated this stance when NBC News contacted the social media company for comment on the newly leaked documents.\n“As we’ve said many times, Six4Three — creators of the Pikinis app — cherry picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app's users,” Paul Grewal, vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement released by the company.\nThe finding of “evidence of a crime or fraud” came from a preliminary decision by the judge in the Six4Three case about an earlier round of leaked documents.\nNBC News has not been able to determine whether the documents represent a complete picture. Facebook declined to provide additional evidence to support the claim of cherry-picking.\nStill, these freshly leaked documents show that the plans to sell access to user data were discussed for years and received support from Facebook’s most senior executives, including Zuckerberg, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox and VP of growth Javier Olivan. Facebook declined to make them available for comment.\nAfter NBC News contacted Facebook for comment, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to the judge in the Six4Three case, claiming that Six4Three had leaked the documents to a “national broadcast network” and seeking to depose Six4Three’s founders. NBC News received the documents from Campbell, who received them from an anonymous source. Six4Three denied leaking the documents.\nWhen Facebook ultimately cut off broad access to user data in 2015, the move contributed to the decline of thousands of competitors and small businesses that relied on what Facebook had previously described as a “level-playing field” in terms of access to data. In addition to Pikinis, the casualties included Lulu, an app that let women rate the men they dated; an identity fraud-detecting app called Beehive ID; and Swedish breast cancer awareness app Rosa Bandet (Pink Ribbon).\nThe strategy orchestrated by Zuckerberg had some of his employees comparing the company to villains from Game of Thrones, while David Poll, a senior engineer, called the treatment of outside app developers “sort of unethical,” according to the documents. But Zuckerberg’s approach also earned admiration: Doug Purdy, Facebook’s director of product, described the CEO as a “master of leverage,” according to the documents.\nFacebook declined to comment on these employee communications.\nOne of the most striking threads to emerge from the documents is the way that Facebook user data was horse-traded to squeeze money or shared data from app developers.\nIn the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in early 2018 and rising awareness of the Six4Three case, Facebook has attempted to frame changes it made to its platform in 2014 and 2015 as being driven by concerns over user privacy. In statements to media organizations, Facebook has said it locked down its platform to protect users from companies that mishandled user data, such as Cambridge Analytica, as well as apps that spammed users’ news feeds or were creepy, such as Six4Three’s bikini-spotting app Pikinis.\nHowever, among the documents leaked, there’s very little evidence that privacy was a major concern of Facebook’s, and the issue was rarely discussed in the thousands of pages of emails and meeting summaries. Where privacy is mentioned, it is often in the context of how Facebook can use it as a public relations strategy to soften the blow of the sweeping changes to developers’ access to user data. The documents include several examples suggesting that these changes were designed to cement Facebook’s power in the marketplace, not to protect users.\nIn Six4Three’s case, for example, Facebook’s head of policy Allison Hendrix acknowledged in a June 2017 deposition obtained by NBC News that the social network never received any complaints about the Pikinis app, nor did Facebook send Six4Three any policy or privacy violation notices. Six4Three, Hendrix confirmed, was playing within the rules Facebook had set for developers.\nDespite this, Six4Three’s access to data, specifically access to a user’s friends’ photos, was cut off in April 2015 as part of sweeping changes to Facebook’s platform announced a year earlier, which affected as many as 40,000 apps. Six4Three shut down the app soon afterward.\n“Our case is about Zuckerberg’s decision to weaponize the reliance of companies on his purportedly neutral platform and to weaponize the private and sensitive data of billions of people,” said Six4Three founder Ted Kramer.\nFacebook recognized early on that working with third-party app developers could help make the social network more interesting and drive the platform’s expansion. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook created tools that allowed the makers of games (remember Farmville?) and other apps to connect with its audience in return for ensuring those users spent more time on Facebook.\nFacebook achieved this through its “Graph API” (Application Programming Interface), a common means to allow software programs to interact with each other. In Facebook’s case, this meant that third-party apps such as games could post updates on people’s profiles, which would be seen by players’ friends and potentially encourage them to play, too. Beyond that, it allowed the makers of those games to access a slew of data from Facebook users, including their connections to friends, likes, locations, updates, photos and more.\nThe Graph API — and particularly the way it let third parties promote their products to and extract data from a user’s social connections — was a key feature of Facebook that Six4Three and thousands of other companies relied upon for viral marketing and user growth.\nHowever, after a few years, Facebook decided the app developers were getting more value from the user data they extracted from Facebook than Facebook was getting out of the app developers, the documents show.\nAfter Facebook went public in May 2012, its stock price plummeted, which Zuckerberg later characterized as “disappointing.” The company was in a desperate position, documents show, with users sharing fewer photos and posts on the platform as they spent more time on their cellphones. An internal Facebook presentation looking back at this period used the phrase “terminal decline” to describe the fall in engagement.\nFacebook executives, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, spent months brainstorming ways to turn the company around. An idea that they kept returning to: make money from the app partners, by charging them for access to Facebook’s users and their data.\nSeveral proposals for charging developers for access to Facebook’s platform and data were put forward in a presentation to the company’s board of directors, according to emails and draft slides from late August 2012.\nAmong the suggestions: a fixed annual fee for developers for reviewing their apps; an access fee for apps that requested user data; and a charge for “premium” access to data, such as a user trust score or a ranking of the strongest relationships between users and their friends.\n“Today the fundamental trade is ‘data for distribution’ whereas we want to change it to either ‘data for $’ and/or ‘$ for distribution,’” Chris Daniels, a Facebook business development director, wrote in an August 2012 email to other top leaders in the company discussing the upcoming presentation.\nDiscussions continued through October, when Zuckerberg explained to close friend Sam Lessin the importance of controlling third-party apps’ ability to access Facebook’s data and reach people’s friends on the platform. Without that leverage, “I don’t think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all,” Zuckerberg wrote in an email to Lessin.\nIn the same week, Zuckerberg floated the idea of pursuing 100 deals with developers “as a path to figuring out the real market value” of Facebook user data and then “setting a public rate” for developers.\nFacebook told NBC News that it was exploring ways to build a sustainable business, but ultimately decided not to go forward with these plans.\nZuckerberg was unfazed by the potential privacy risks associated with Facebook’s data-sharing arrangements.\nFacebook told NBC News that this was an example of a cherry-picked email designed to bolster Six4Three’s case.\nZuckerberg didn’t know it at the time, but a privacy bug affecting an unnamed third-party app would create precisely this kind of strategic risk the following year, according to a panicked chatlog between Michael Vernal, who was director of engineering, and other senior employees.\nIt’s not clear exactly what happened or which app was involved, but it appears that Zuckerberg’s private communications could have leaked from Facebook to the external app in an unexpected way.\n“Holy crap,” replied Avichal Garg, then director of product management.\nVernal and Garg did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe existing arrangement, where developers weren’t required to share their data back with Facebook, might be “good for the world” but it’s not “good for us,” Zuckerberg wrote in the email.\nHe noted that though Facebook could charge developers to access user data, the company stood to benefit more from requiring developers to compensate Facebook in kind — with their own data — and by pushing those developers to pay for advertising on Facebook’s platform.\nThe endgame: to ensure Facebook maintained its dominant position in the market.\n“The purpose of the platform is to tie the universe of all the social apps together so we can enable a lot more sharing and still remain the central social hub,” Zuckerberg said in the email.\nFacebook told NBC News that the focus of “full reciprocity” was to enable users to share their experiences within external apps with their friends on Facebook, not about providing Facebook with user data.\nWith Zuckerberg’s vision for Facebook set, the company began making deals with some of its most valued partners, including dozens of app developer friends of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. Facebook whitelisted their access to feeds of user data while restricting that same access to apps that Facebook viewed as competitors.\nThese data access deals prepared key partners, including Tinder, Sony and Microsoft, for sweeping changes to the Facebook platform that the company planned to announce at its annual developer conference in April 2014 and enforce within a year.\nIn one instance, described in June 2013 documents, Amazon received special treatment for the launch of a group gifting product, despite the fact that it competed with one of Facebook’s own products.\n“Remind me, why did we allow them to do this? Do we receive any cut of purchases?” Chris Daniels, then Facebook’s director of business development, asked in an email.\n“If so, we'd like to restrict them at the same time to group this into one press cycle,\" he wrote in an email.\nDeal negotiations created confusion among partners who had grown accustomed to unfettered access to Facebook user data.\nSome Facebook employees were unhappy about this direction, particularly the way the company appeared to be blocking competitors from accessing data.\nLacker and Poll declined to comment. Vernal and Klimt did not respond to requests for comment.\nFacebook declined to comment on the employee exchanges.\nWhen it came to publicly announcing the sweeping changes at Facebook’s annual F8 developer conference in April 2014, members of the communications team worked with Zuckerberg to craft a narrative around user trust, not competition or profitability.\nFacebook told NBC News that it was “completely reasonable” for someone on the communications team to discuss the best way to get the message out on changes to the platform.\nUser trust was crucial when Zuckerberg delivered his speech at the event on April 30, 2014.\nBut despite Facebook’s public focus on privacy, staff member emails described confusion over the way third-party apps could override users’ privacy settings.\nEven if users locked down their account so that their photos and other data were visible to “only me,” those photos could still be transferred to third parties, according to the documents.\nFacebook said this was another example of cherry-picked emails.\nEven though Facebook eventually decided not to charge developers directly for access to user data, the extensive discussions around its monetary value, shown in the leaked documents, could create lasting problems for the company, privacy and policy experts say.\nThe biggest threat Facebook faces now is not competition but antitrust regulation, which is designed to promote fair competition among companies for the benefit of consumers, using fines or restrictions on mergers and acquisitions.\nRegulators have typically struggled to build robust antitrust cases against technology companies that offer services to users for free. If the product is free, then it’s harder to argue that the consumer is being harmed by a monopoly.\nBut if regulators can show that users were paying for access to Facebook with their personal data, and that Facebook valued that data as leverage against competitors, that could expose Facebook to an antitrust complaint, said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade association representing digital publishers (including NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News).\nFacebook said that the service has always been free for users and developers.\nPolicymakers have called for the FTC to investigate Facebook specifically for violating antitrust laws.\nThe company “appears to have used its dominance to cripple other competitive threats by cutting them off from its massive network,” Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the",

We in England have adopted the term \"German angst\" from you.\nSPIEGEL: One of the approaches to stop climate change that you are favoring is carbon capture and storage, meaning filtering out the carbon dioxide emitted from industrial plants and storing it underground. This method is very controversial in Germany because of safety concerns. Are the Germans excessively timid?\nBranson: I don't want to criticize the Germans, but I do believe that we need new technologies to stop climate change.

I would say that the environment is the winner here.\nSPIEGEL: With your airlines, you're one of the big polluters of the environment yourself. What are you doing about this?\nBranson: We have been investing profits yielded by our transportation companies into the development of new technologies that lower carbon emissions. Those investments have amounted to around $3 billion over the years. Our main goal is to find a new fuel which will replace the kerosene produced from oil.\nSPIEGEL: So? Are there any concrete prospects you could talk about?\nBranson: The development of fuels from plants or waste materials such as industrial waste gas is in an advanced state. This will be a huge market, once we have scaled up production of these fuels. Just thinking of how much money we will save because we don't have to pay the taxes and duties levied on kerosene anymore makes me feel real good.\nSPIEGEL: Wouldn't it be better for our climate if in the future people would just fly less? About 3 percent of all carbon emissions can be attributed to aviation alone.\nBranson: It would be the wrong approach to lead humanity back to the dark ages. The global economy is already in a slump, so we can't exacerbate things by keeping the planes on the ground as well. What we need to do instead is use our brains and our creativity.

If we can increase the harvests of a field using modern technology and better cultivation methods, we can enjoy greater yields without the need for deforestation.\nSPIEGEL: You have offered a reward of $25 million for suggestions on how to lower carbon emissions in an economically reasonable fashion.

One objective that comes with actively contributing the to growth of the company is networking, and it can be viewed as a perk or a pitfall. I've been doing some research on best practices to make sure that I am making my efforts worthwhile and thought why not share some of my collective tips with my closest friends! Take them as you may and let me know what experiences you have had in networking for yourself and your business.\nDo - Have business cards, and an ample amount. If you are expecting to meet 50 people, bring 100 cards.\nDon't - Expect people to remember or write down your contact information. Another related don't, don't forget to collect their card as well. You don't want to be stuck \"hoping he'll call first\".\nDo - Make notes on the back of business cards you collect with key points that will help you remember the person the next day.\nDon't - Give out a card to everyone and anyone. Consider those who you might actually do business with, but keep in mind that while they may not be a prospect today, they may be tomorrow.\nDo - Mingle, mingle, mingle. Ok, so this is not speed dating, but you should try to work the room a bit so you interact with several people throughout the event.\nDon't - Spend all night talking to one person, you will likely miss out on some other great connections.\nDo - Sit with a table full of strangers. You are here to meet people so put yourself in a position that will encourage you to do so.\nDon't - Be joined at the hip with a colleague or friend, you are not at work or at the club so you do not need a wing man or woman. In fact, go to these events alone, it will further push you to meet new people.\nDo - Practice and use a well structured, memorable elevator pitch. You want people to remember you and your business so build in key factors that make your business unique and stand out from the rest of the crowd.\nDon't - Make yourself the focus, professionally (unless you are an independent professional) or personally. You are not there to talk about your new puppy or the great date you had last week, keep the topic on work while keeping the conversation light and engaging.\nDo - Give a firm handshake, the handshake is the entrance to that first impression. Make sure its strong but not overwhelming (or sweaty, no one likes a sweaty handshake!).\nDon't - Be overzealous in your approach. You don't want to scare them away before you even start the conversation.\nDo - Eat and drink in moderation. This is not a wedding with an open bar, be mindful that you need to speak with people, with eloquence and nothing in your teeth.\nDon't - Get drunk! One of the biggest don'ts in networking is having one too many and leaving a sour taste in people's mouths. Save your table dancing for Spring Break in Cancun.\nDo - Prepare questions that will clearly and concisely get you the right information to gauge the connection quickly. No use wasting an hour talking to someone, albeit interesting, but who has no connection with your business type.\nDon't - Forget to follow up. Email, call, connect with them in some way with a few days while the conversations are still fresh.\nFinally, Do - Keep in regular communication with your new connections, even a few times a year, to see what they are up to.\nDon't - Forget to nurture your current network. Develop some type of cycle to ensure you have routine check ins with all of your key connections.\nI hope this collection of tips is helpful, there are many more, but I can only hold your attention for so long. Again, I'd love to hear your stories about networking gone right or terribly wrong so please feel free to comment below.\nGood information- a portion of it requires you to go beyond your comfort zone - being able to do that shows signs of a good manager/leader - it requires you to continually be aware of the necessity to \"push\" youself.\nAnonymous",

Once you have isolated what it was about them, try to incorporate that into your own introductions and conversations.\nIt may be difficult at first, but once you've practiced it and honed it down, it becomes a part of how you present yourself, and YOU become the most engaging person someone else has ever met.",

(NYSE: AHT) (\"Ashford Trust\" or the \"Company\") announced today that it has successfully refinanced a mortgage loan with an existing outstanding balance totaling approximately $972 million. The previous mortgage loan that was refinanced was the Highland Pool loan with a final maturity date in April 2021.

The loan is secured by twenty-two hotels: Courtyard Boston Downtown, Courtyard Denver, Courtyard Gaithersburg, Courtyard Savannah, Hampton Inn Parsippany, Hilton Parsippany, Hilton Tampa, Hilton Garden Inn Austin, Hilton Garden Inn BWI, Hilton Garden Inn Virginia Beach, Hyatt Windwatch Long Island, Hyatt Savannah, Marriott DFW Airport, Marriott Omaha, Marriott San Antonio, Marriott Sugarland, Renaissance Palm Springs, Ritz-Carlton Atlanta, Residence Inn Tampa, Churchill, Melrose and Silversmith.\n\"This refinancing is a successful continuation of our recent debt capital market strategies to create shareholder value by extending our loan maturity schedule as well as significantly lowering our spread, which we expect to result in substantial interest expense savings,\" said Douglas A.

The ceremony was also attended by a number of dignitaries, health ministers, and policymakers from around the world.\nThe final day of the summit also featured a speech on tackling depression by a swimming legend, a call to action on the effects of climate change on health, and a message from the director general of WHO.\nA panel discussion on ‘Anxiety and Depression’ took place, chaired by Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, the leading mental health charity in England and Wales. The forum discussed the current global burden of people living with anxiety and depression, risk factors of developing the illnesses, and the treatment gap.\nAccording to the WHO, only one in 27 people receive adequate care for anxiety or depression in some low and middle-income countries.\nPanelists also discussed how, despite differences in culture and healthcare systems, effective interventions can be translated, accepted, and adapted to various settings.\nRecord-breaking Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps delivered a keynote speech on the subject of anxiety and depression, having suffered with mental health issues throughout his illustrious career.\n“As an athlete, I was taught always to be strong, to never show weakness, and push through any obstacle. At times my depression would overpower me and I’d put my head under the water and scream. In the end, I was lucky. I realised that it was ok to talk about it. As I started opening up and talking about my mental health challenges, I found strength, not vulnerability, and I realised that that it’s OK to not be OK,” he explained.\nOther topics discussed on the second day of the summit included providing healthcare to remote areas, how healthcare systems plan for the long term, and safety in maternity",

        "prompt": "The loss of the space shuttle Columbia and its seven astronauts poses grave challenges for NASA, just as the Challenger disaster did 17 years ago.\nThe short-term problem is to resume shuttle launches in order to sustain and complete the &dollar;60 billion International Space Station (ISS). The longer-term issue – accentuated by the loss of Columbia on Saturday – is developing a new generation of crewed spacecraft to replace the decades-old shuttle fleet.\nNASA has now lost two of its five space shuttles in the course of 113 launches. Challenger exploded in 1986 shortly after launch. Columbia is the first US spacecraft to be destroyed during the landing phase. A Soviet cosmonaut died in 1967 when his Soyuz 1 capsule crashed as it returned to Earth, and three cosmonauts perished in 1971 when their oxygen supply failed on the way back from Salyut 1.\nYet until that can be done the three remaining shuttles will be grounded. How long remains an open question until the causes are identified and remedies planned. NASA needed 32 months to resume launches after the Challenger explosion.\nThe most pressing problem is the three-person crew currently aboard the ISS. The shuttle Atlantis was to bring a replacement crew in March, as well as install and repair equipment. That flight is now very unlikely, but a Russian Progress rocket launched on Sunday is bringing the ISS crew enough food and supplies to last until June.\nRussia is now the only nation capable of delivering crews and supplies to the station until shuttle flights resume. The station crew can return to Earth on a Russian Soyuz “lifeboat” delivered on by a taxi mission in November. Soyuz modules are rated for only six months in space, but Russian rockets can deliver replacements.\nHowever, the cash-strapped Russian space agency has been at odds with the US over money to continue flights to the station. Unless those issues can be resolved, NASA could be faced with mothballing the station.\nThe grounding of the shuttle fleet also casts serious doubt over the completion of the half-built ISS, the most expensive object ever made. Only the shuttle can deliver the large elements required and seven shuttle flights were planned up to the scheduled completion date for the core ISS in February 2004.\nThe disaster also steps up pressure on NASA to develop a replacement for its ageing shuttle fleet, of which Columbia was the first launched in 1981. That effort has faltered several times.\nIn",

It would be launched by a new generation of expendable rockets developed for military launches.\nThis plan requires the development human-rated versions of the military rockets as well as the space plane, so the first crewed launches were not planned until 2012. A full-scale new launcher would not fly until 2015, and so NASA had planned to extend the service life of the space shuttles until 2020.\nRaw statistics make another 17 years of shuttle flights appear unwise. Two flights in 113 have now ended in fatal disasters and, with six launches a year planned, another failure might be predicted in the next decade.\nThe big questions are whether NASA can convincingly cut that failure rate, improve on its dismal performance in developing new crewed spacecraft, and do both before public patience and money runs out.",

AFib is the most common heart rhythm disorder, causes the heart to beat rapidly and skip beats, and if left untreated, can cause strokes.\nThe results suggest that caffeine intake of up to 300 mg per day may be safe for arrhythmic patients, this is equal to about three cups. “There is a public perception, often based on anecdotal experience, that caffeine is a common acute trigger for heart rhythm problems,” said lead author Peter Kistler, Director at Melbourne’s Alfred Hospital.\n“Many doctors recommend patients with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias avoid caffeinated beverages – particularly coffee – however our extensive review of medical literature suggests this is unfounded,” Kistler added.

They are still best avoided by patients with pre-existing heart conditions,” he added.",

Think Kootsie's too cutesy?\nWhen it comes to partying like it's no longer 1999, thousands indeed will pour into downtown Buffalo for the two largest end-of-the-century parties, First Night Buffalo and the long-running Kootsie Ball at the Connecticut Street Armory.\nBut scores of other Western New Yorkers intend to be far from that madding crowd, ready to do -- in the words of Monty Python -- something completely different to ring in Y2K.\nIn Niagara County, for example, the Town of Wilson is staging its own mini-First Night.\nTownsfolk will don coats, gather outside the Wilson House Restaurant (where many may be enjoying the $50 prime-rib-and-five-hour-open-bar special), dance to music provided by a local DJ and then watch the ball drop, courtesy of a crane from Clark Rigging Co. of Niagara Falls.\n\"Floyd Clark began it all when he found the ball in a scrap yard a while back,\" said Wilson House manager Lou Ligammari. \"It's about 8 feet in diameter. He made it look like a big apple, put red lights around it and then put the year on it in lights.\"\nA few minutes before midnight, a lottery is held to see which town resident will pull the crane lever and make the ball drop.

        "prompt": "Mexico’s debut bidding event in Round One of its energy reform is now history, and resulted in what was widely agreed was a poor showing.\nNow, the post-mortems have begun, both within industry and the Mexican government, which openly acknowledged it needs to do a better job of listening to industry’s concerns about contract terms that might have attracted more winners had the sticking points been addressed to begin with.\nOf 14 exploratory blocks offered in shallow waters in the Bay of Campeche — the same area that produces a large chunk of Mexico’s current 2.257 million b/d of crude production — the July 15 auction produced winners on just two tracts. Both were captured by a consortium made up of Mexican startup Sierra Oil & Gas, US’ Talos Energy and UK’s Premier Oil. Six blocks received offers, but on four blocks the sole bid on each was below minimum amounts set by the government. The other two blocks received more than one bid.\nIn addition to bidders’ pre-event complaints about relatively small fields, other objections abounded.\nFor example, the four-year terms with two-year extensions may have been too short for some operators that wanted longer contract terms for more extensive exploration, a top official for energy consultants IHS said.\nThe operators may have wanted to perform “more extensive exploration, such as whether there might be complex pre-salt formations that could be exploited at deeper levels,” said Carlos Pascual, senior vice president of the large consultancy and former US Ambassador to Mexico, in testimony last week before the US government’s House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.\nIn addition, “government minimum bids may have been influenced by historic Pemex production costs, which may be lower than the costs estimated by potential investors,” Pascual said.\nAfter the bidding, obviously chastened bidding officials pledged to do better for the upcoming second bidding phase, which will involve five blocks also in the Bay of Campeche but this time aimed at exploitation of the fields. That will take place on September 30, and it’s unknown if the round will be postponed to allow the government more time to make the changes.\nBut the two most competitive blocks attracted offers much higher than the minimum bids, the analysts noted. In other cases, had the minimum been set as little as 5% lower, “the blocks would have been sold” and the government would have ended up with something rather than nothing in those cases, they added.\nThe lesson? Set a lower minimum and let the market determine the price, and let geologists lead on valuing the blocks, the analysts said. They also applauded the mechanics of the process which they said worked “beautifully” — since it was transparent, webcast over the Internet, and each bid was read aloud and prominently displayed for the cameras.\nAs to contract terms, however, risk and reward are still out of balance, the Atlantic Council analysts said. Mexico held bidding rounds for numerous blocks in the 2000s for fee-based service contracts that paid companies according to incremental production. Interest was low among international companies, and Mexican bidders or smaller companies mostly ended up as winners of those rounds.\nThe specter of that contract type apparently still hovers over the present production-sharing and license agreements, according to Goldwyn and",
        "baseline": " Gill.\nIn addition, bidders were concerned about “holes” in the geologic data offered which need to be fixed, they said.\nThe consensus is that Mexico has made great progress, but needs additional tweaks to come up to international standards and terms satisfactory enough to attract Big Oil (and even Medium Oil) in sufficient numbers. And with deepwater bidding being planned, the tweaking needs to happen sooner rather than later.\n“With some lessons learned from the first round, there is every reason for optimism that further success is achievable and likely,” Goldwyn and Gill said.\nStarr Spencer is a Senior Writer covering the oil industry at S&P Global Platts in Houston.

        "prompt": "Tales and Trails: What are the fish doing these days?\nThe short answer is: about the same as the rest of the year. They breathe, eat and try to avoid being eaten. There are, however, some differences in winter.\nThat means their body temperatures are controlled through external means, in this case, water temperature. They do not maintain a constant body temperature like us mammals.\nClose to 80 percent of human energy goes towards heating our bodies to a stable temperature. For fish, this is not an advantage. For one reason, their source of food, often insect based, is limited in the winter. In Montana, the winter temperature of water that doesn’t freeze usually is in the 30s or low 40s. To raise an organism’s body temperature to 98.6 in that cold environment would require a tremendous amount of food, which just isn’t there for fish.\nRather than devote large amounts of energy simply to heat up their bodies, fish have adapted to the cold rather than adopted a “central heating system” like a mammal.\nAnd what a magnificent adaptation. A warm-blooded animal requires five to 10 times as much food as a cold-blooded animal of the same size and build; so, cold-blooded animals are better at surviving in barren environments, though not all fish species respond the same.\nCold water species, think burbot, are no longer confined to cold water pockets like in the summer and may range more widely. Other species, such as bluegills, may do the opposite – that is hang out and not expend much energy. They can accomplish this by not eating for weeks or months. Generally, however, everything underwater slows down, and life continues just swimmingly, thank you, as long as there’s oxygen. Ah yes, oxygen.\nIn an average winter, ice and snow form a lid on a lake or reservoir. If that lid is too thick, it prevents light penetration thus shutting down oxygen",
        "baseline": " production from photosynthesis by aquatic plants. In addition to producing no new oxygen, the existing aquatic plants die.\nMicrobes at the bottom of the lake decompose the organic matter, the dead aquatic vegetation. If the lake is too shallow and the winter too long, those microbes will use up all the oxygen breaking it down. The result can be too little oxygen to support a lake’s fish, and they die.\nIn deeper lakes or mild winters, most fish survive. Plus, fish have adapted to slow down in the winter, as being too active would burn through their oxygen reserve.\nThen, as water warms under the spring sun, ice-out occurs, insect life increases, and a fish’s metabolism rises just in time to take advantage of the increasing food.\nUntil then, fish mostly hang out in the same spot and wait for spring and open water.\nFor now, for all of us, warm water and summer sun are just a dream.",

This causes the water to rise, and the water above the ice cools and contracts. This causes the water to sink.

Remember, fish breathe through their gills, and if there’s no oxygen, they can’t breathe. This is why ice fishing is a winter sport. During the winter, fish are more concentrated in the open water areas of a lake or reservoir. Generally, these areas are near the surface, and the fish are in the top 10 feet of water. If you can find the open water, you can find the fish.\nThe other thing that happens in the winter is that the fish become more active. You may have noticed that when you’re ice fishing, you can catch a lot of fish in a short period of time. Some of this is due to the fact that the fish are concentrated in the open water areas, but it’s also due to the fact that they are more active.

        "prompt": "Who Asked Susan Rice to Unmask those Names?\nObama’s national security advisor is a liar -- and possibly a felon.\nFormer President Obama’s National Security Advisor Susan Rice asked for the names of Trump transition officials to be unmasked and made public in raw intelligence files, according to media reports, a move apparently carried out to harm the incoming Trump administration.\nAs recently as March 22, Rice denied knowing anything about the intelligence reports. In an appearance on “PBS Newshour,” she said pretty definitely, “I know nothing about this.” The new news reports paint Rice as a liar.\nThe evidence we know about in the Trump-Russia saga so far seems to be pointing at Obama.\nThe unmasked names, of people associated with Donald Trump, were then sent to all those at the National Security Council, some at the Defense Department, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan – essentially, the officials at the top, including former Rice deputy Ben Rhodes.\nThe names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him, including family members, for up to a year before he took office.\nThe spreading of the unmasked names was carried out for “political purposes that have nothing to do with national security” or foreign intelligence, Housley said. \"It had everything to do with hurting and embarrassing Trump and his team,\" he said, citing his sources.\nWhat is incidental collection, by the way?\nIn this example, “if Bob is targeted for surveillance and Alice contacts him during that surveillance, resulting in the incidental collection of her communications with him, her name should be redacted or ‘masked’ unless leaving it unredacted provides foreign intelligence value.” Masking is done to protect U.S. persons (i.e. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, etc.) who get inadvertently caught up in the electronic dragnet from being falsely accused of crimes or otherwise improper behavior.\nAssuming these news reports about data that supposedly was incidentally collected are accurate, they raise a multitude of new questions about the ongoing scandal concerning alleged collaboration between the Trump team and Russia.\nWe still don’t know who asked then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice to unmask those names – or if she acted on her own initiative. But the most likely culprit has to be President Obama himself, along with those in his inner circle such as his Islamist CIA director John Brennan and his slimy national-security aide Ben Rhodes.\nBut whoever did the deed, it appears someone used America’s taxpayer-funded national security apparatus to engage in likely unlawful espionage against an opposition presidential campaign, an incoming administration, and that administration’s transition team. It’s the stuff of banana republics, which makes sense, because Obama spent eight long, lawless years trying to turn the United States into precisely that.\nThose persons may have participated in a virtual fishing expedition to dig up dirt on Team Trump and cripple his administration with scandals like the still-unproven collusion between Trump’s people and Russia and the seemingly wild claim that Russia somehow “hacked” the November election.\nSusan Rice has no shortage of chutzpah.\nThe foundation of the United States’ unrivaled global leadership rests only in part on our military might, the strength of our economy and the power of our ideals. It is also grounded in the perception that the United States is steady, rational and fact-based. To lead effectively, the United States must maintain respect and trust. So, when a White House deliberately dissembles and serially contorts the facts, its actions pose a serious risk to America’s global leadership, among friends and adversaries alike.\nIn her defense, Rice knows a lot about dissembling and contorting facts, things that are her stock-in-trade. Her statements are difficult to take seriously because she is a prolific liar.\nRice’s serial dishonesty and astonishingly bad judgment calls are well-documented.\nRice embraced the 2014 deal wherein President Obama freed five senior Taliban commanders and high-value terrorists from Guantanamo Bay, in exchange for U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl who deserted in 2009 and collaborated with the Taliban for the next five years. Eight U.S. soldiers were killed in the effort to find and recover Bergdahl who emailed his father just before deserting, claiming he was “ashamed” to be American. In June 2014 Rice went on ABC TV to justify the prisoner swap, falsely stating that Bergdahl “served the United States with honor and distinction.” The next year the Army charged Bergdahl with desertion.\nRice has long believed the leftist myth that poverty creates Muslim terrorists. She inspired the Obama administration’s “de-emphasizing [of] military action against terrorists, while looking for ways to address the ‘root causes’ of the violence.” She co-wrote a 2005 academic article that claimed terrorism was “a threat borne of both oppression and deprivation.\" Of course, Rice endorsed President Obama’s illegal war in Libya which was justified on bogus humanitarian concerns.\nAfter deadly Muslim terrorist-orchestrated bombings in 1998, President Clinton wheeled Rice out to lie to television viewers about inadequate security provided at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Then-U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell had begged then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for extra security to guard against terrorist threats, including her own possible assassination. After the bombings Rice showed up on PBS to speak for the Clinton administration. She claimed the administration had \"maintain[ed] a high degree of security at all of our embassies at all times\" and that there was \"no telephone warning or call of any sort like that, that might have alerted either embassy just prior to the blast.\"\nIn 1996 Rice helped to persuade President Clinton to reject Sudan’s offer to deliver Osama bin Laden to the U.S.\nDuring the 1994 Rwandan genocide that claimed the lives of 800,000 people in a 100-day period, Rice worked in Bill Clinton’s White House. She “was a key player in the Clinton administration's decision not to intervene in a peacekeeping role, so as to avoid becoming embroiled in a politically risky endeavor where no strategic U.S. interests were in",
        "baseline": " play.” The Clinton people lied afterward, claiming they didn’t know the extent of the carnage in Rwanda. Rice played a role in the cover-up, convincing the administration to strike terms such as “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing” from CIA and State Department memos related to Rwanda. “If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November [congressional] election?\" Rice said, according to Obama’s UN Ambassador Samantha Power.\nAmong other famous Rhodes Scholars, who tend to be highly influential in their professional lives, are MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, former President Bill Clinton, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), feminist Naomi Wolf, Wesley Clark, former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wisc.), and New York Times columnist Nick Kristof.\nWhich may help to explain why America is in such rough shape today.",

She also claimed that the U.S. had no intelligence that a terrorist attack was imminent, when in fact the CIA had warned of an imminent attack on the Benghazi compound.\nRice lied about the Obama administration’s role in the Iran nuclear deal.

Hundreds of federal employees are being instructed to work without pay.\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) wrote a letter to Trump’s administration on Jan. 4. The regional leaders urged the president and Congressional leaders to end the government shutdown because of its negative effects on state and local budgets, government services, the economy and the livelihoods of federal workers.\nThe leaders also cited the threat the shutdown poses to public safety and health, especially in areas maintained and safeguarded by federal employees. The shutdown puts coasts and waterways at risk because of the shutdown’s restrictions on the daily operations of the Environmental Protection Agency and Coast Guard, according to the letter.\nThe reduced number of federal workers also leads to lower standards of safety and sanitation in national parks, according to the letter.\nFive workers affected by the government shutdown anonymously filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for requiring them to work without pay. The lawsuit alleges that the administration labeled the defendants as essential workers without proof that their work meets the necessary standards. The Jan. 9 lawsuit seeks to prevent the federal government from mandating employees work without pay.\nHayley Grande (COL ’21), president of the Georgetown University College Republicans, commented on the conditions of unpaid federal workers, but acknowledged that benefits could arise from the shutdown.\nThe reduced number of federal workers because of the shutdown adds to the day-to-day considerations students must take when making travel plans or visiting D.C. attractions, according to Georgetown University Democrats Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).\n“I think that us living in D.C. has also opened our eyes. I know traveling back, I definitely went to the airport earlier, so even just small things like that, and even the museums are closed,” Hollister said in an interview with the Hoya.\nBeyond preventing federal workers from receiving their paychecks, the shutdown also hurts local businesses dependent on closed tourist attractions, according to Washington’s Top News.\nWhile the metro system, local government, Library of Congress and Kennedy Center remain open, the Smithsonian museums, National Zoo, National Gallery, National Archives, Washington Monument, Rock Creek Park and other government-run attractions remain closed until further notice.\nThe closure of federally-run national attractions has decreased revenues for business owners and taxi drivers reliant on visitors to these attractions. Additionally, tour groups operating in D.C. have attempted to fill in gaps in tour schedules by working with privately-owned museums, according to The Washington Post.\nThough the shutdown has caused some disturbances in the District, the city is taking efforts to alleviate limitations caused by the federal government’s limited operations.

        "prompt": "The series of doping scandals that has stunned world sport in recent weeks should surprise no one who is familiar with the demands professional competition can make on the human body. Disciplines including cycling and athletics have long required performances that exceed the limits of the most athletically gifted. The avalanche of revelations is a powerful reminder that doping subcultures have flourished for decades under the noses of officials and journalists who should have known better, or chose to keep quiet.\nThe doping epidemic of the past 40 years can be understood as an adaptive response to the conflict between natural human limits and the demand for superhuman performances from both the global sports entertainment industry and politicians eager to exploit nationalist feelings. Their mass constituencies are the spectators, who, whether watching baseball's muscle-packed home-run hitters or sinewy Tour de France riders, seem increasingly tolerant of drug-assisted performances.\nThis spate of major doping cases does not mean that systematic drug use is a new development. Previous generations of athletes also doped their way past their natural limits. The massive use of amphetamines and anabolic steroids by Olympic athletes and American football players was openly practised as early as the 1960s. Sports Illustrated magazine's superb coverage of the emerging doping crisis in 1969 was ignored by the US Olympic committee and all the other sports bureaucrats who should have grasped its implications.\nDoping in the Tour de France was also endemic, and well known, at this time. The five-time Tour champion Jacques Anquetil stated publicly in 1967: \"I dope myself. Everyone [who is a competitive cyclist] dopes himself. Those who claim they don't are liars. For 50 years bike racers have been taking stimulants ... Since we are constantly asked to go faster and make even greater efforts, we are obliged to take stimulants.\"\nThe passage of a French anti-doping law in 1965 amounted to nothing more than a feeble gesture of resistance to habits that had become an integral part of the sport. A third of a century would pass before a cabinet minister would dispatch police to enforce anti-doping laws, resulting in the great Tour de France scandal of 1998.\nSince that time the use of illicit drugs has entrenched itself as standard behaviour in the Tour and other major European races. A disturbingly high proportion of cyclists who have stood on the Tour de France podium over the past 45 years have been found to be using banned drugs on at least one occasion. The handful of riders who openly oppose doping have at times been treated like pariahs by their fellow riders - the worker-athletes who are intent on retaining the workplace doping techniques that help to keep them on their bikes and off the factory floor.\nIn the meantime, the average speed of the top 50 Tour riders has actually increased. This suggests that the presumably stricter doping controls introduced following the 1998 Tour scandal did not result in a",
        "baseline": " diminished level of performance among the leading riders. But does this not seem odd? Shouldn't the post-scandal performance level of the heavily doped 1998 peloton have gone down after more effective testing was introduced?\nSimilar doping scenarios can be found in other sports. Justin Gatlin's positive result (his coach claims he is the victim of sabotage) means that three of the five men who have run the 100m sprint in under 9.8 seconds have tested positive for doping. The top five shot-put performances of all time were all produced by steroid-boosted athletes. And the list goes on.\nAt the heart of the problem is bureaucrats' failure to understand the culture they are trying to change. The culture of lying about doping is rooted in economic ambitions and the feelings of entitlement to a broad range of human enhancements that are now infiltrating everyday life in modern societies. The idea that elite athletes will volunteer for service as our last pharmacological virgins is a pipe dream.",

The IOC's anti-doping code is a toothless document that has been repeatedly ignored by athletes and officials alike.

The commission's president, Prince Alexandre de Merode, has been a staunch defender of the right of athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe IOC's failure to take effective action is not surprising.

I was also struck by the way in which the Tour de France, and the other great French cycling races, were used by the French state as a tool of foreign policy. The French government and the Tour de France organisers would go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the Tour was won by a Frenchman. This was done by giving the French riders and teams every possible advantage, and by imposing a series of obstacles on the foreign riders.

Williams, director Development Services for Yavapai County.\n“It’s the first code cycle in my career of almost 20 years where it has put this level of common sense back into the code,” Williams said.\nOne of the changes involves the seismic zone in this area. Williams said the prior code had requirements for building as if the home were on top of the San Andreas Fault Line in California. “The new code puts it where it’s appropriate for our area,” he said.\nAnother change simplifies the sheer wall bracing requirements, and provides prescriptive measures. The 2018 code makes life a lot easier, Williams added.\nYavapai County is in the process of reviewing the code and about three-quarters of the way through. Williams said he anticipates formal hearings in May, then action on adopting the code in July.\nIn Prescott Valley, a Building Board of Appeals (BBA) workshop will take place Wednesday, April 10, with expected approval by the BBA at the April 24 meeting, said Warren Colvin, building inspector for the town. Adopting the code will need council approval; no date has been set.\n“We hope to be enforcing the 2018 Codes in October of 2019,” Colvin said, adding that the advantage of all entities using the same code is to provide more consistency in Yavapai County and to be more user-friendly to the contractors who build in the Quad Cities.\nIn Prescott, Community Development Director Bryn Stotler covers areas such as planning and zoning, building plan review and inspections, and historic preservation. She, too, thinks the general public will benefit.\nStotler said those who are building, remodeling, developing, or looking to own within a development will benefit from more concise timeframes attached to plan review and permit issuance in each municipality.\nAll jurisdictions began collaborative meetings in November, with a goal to enact the 2018 Code by July.

She anticipates adoption by Prescott City Council to take place in late April or early May.\nSome jurisdictions have customized codes, Stotler stated. Prescott has a unique snow load criteria that would be inapplicable in a lower-elevation jurisdiction, for example. Chino Valley may adopt an administrative code that applies a higher wind load standards.\n“This is really great and has never happened before in our area,” said Sandy Griffis, executive director for Yavapai County Contractors Association.\nShould people living at county’s outskirts pay more in permit fees?",

        "prompt": "Google Earth exposes a U.S. drone base in Pakistan.\nThe picture, taken from directly overhead, shows an airfield in Pakistan. It looks like a video frame from one of the American killer drones that have been hunting Taliban and al-Qaida fighters there. But that can’t be: The drones are right there in the frame, sitting on the ground. So who took the picture?\nA plain old commercial satellite, apparently. The image was freely available on Google Earth until Wednesday, when the News of Pakistan published a story about it. At that point, it vanished, as other sensitive military pictures have done. Today, you can still view it on the Web site of the Times of London. If you’re a Pakistani citizen, it confirms that the United States has been launching its killer drones from inside your country, contrary to your government’s pretense of opposition. And if you’re a Taliban or al-Qaida fighter, it’s your chance to look down on the drones the way they’ve been looking down on you.\nThis isn’t the first time miscreants have used Google Earth. Two years ago, the Times notes, “its images of British military bases were found in the homes of Iraqi insurgents.” And last year, “India said that the militants who attacked Mumbai in November had used Google Earth to familiarize themselves with their targets.” Terrorists may not have their own drones or satellites yet. But they know how to use publicly available imagery.\nThe picture, together with a second picture of the same site taken sometime this year and posted on Google Earth, destroys much of the political advantage of the U.S. drones. The drones aren’t supposed to be a U.S. military presence in Pakistan. They’re unmanned, and until now, they were thought to be flown exclusively from the Afghan border. The satellite images, backed by expert analysis, prove otherwise. The drones are on Pakistani soil. And if the drones are there, so are the U.S. personnel who physically manage them.\n“No. No. No. No. No. We unequivocally and emphatically can tell you that there is no basing of US troops in Pakistan,” he said. “There is no basing of US Air Force, Navy, Marines, Army, none, on the record and emphatically. I want that to be very clear. And that is the answer any way you want to put it. There is no base here, no troops billeted. We do not operate here.”He said that he could not comment on CIA operations.\nYou get the picture. The CIA operates the drones, as has been thoroughly reported, so that the military can deny a presence in Pakistan. On paper, the ruse works because presence is just a concept. But pictures of the base drive home its reality.\nSo why are we basing the drones in Pakistan? Why not just fly them from Afghanistan, as advertised? The Pakistani base is “within minutes of potential al-Qaeda and Taliban targets,” the Times observes. “It allows Predator drones to come and go, seen by few civilians.” And it “allows the drones to observe and attack targets within Pakistan’s borders without disrupting the country’s air defenses by crossing” from Afghanistan.\nOf these possible reasons, the most intriguing is proximity. The base is 200 miles",

To capitalize fully on actionable intelligence, you have to move fast. That’s how the drones killed 60 insurgents in two strikes last weekend, before they could disperse. Every minute—and therefore, every mile—counts.\nThis is a crucial difference between the view from the drone and the view from Google Earth. Google gets its images every few months, when a satellite passes overhead. Neither of its pictures of the Pakistani airfield is dated, except for the year. The drones don’t have to wait that long. They can go wherever we want them to, sending back instantaneous images. And if the images are sufficiently hot and incriminating, we can pull the trigger.\nSo enjoy the view from the satellite, Mr. Bin Laden.

        "prompt": "HOLYOKE - When 500 students take their seats in the high school auditorium for a production of \"The Great Gatsby\" by the National Players Theater touring company on Friday, they will have much more than a passing knowledge of the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic novel set in Long Island and New York during the Roaring Twenties.\nOver the last few months, Joseph Courchesne, an English teacher at Holyoke High School, has been the students' guide as they delved into the world of the mysterious Jay Gatsby, the super-rich Daisy and Tom Buchanan and the unfolding tragedy including a hit-and-run, a murder and organized crime told through the eyes of narrator Nick Caraway.\n\"Despite being a novel primarily about rich white people in the 1920s, 'The Great Gatsby' explores a variety of themes and issues that are very relevant to teenagers today,\" Courchesne said.\n\"That's the beauty of Gatsby,\" which many critics hail as the great American novel, Courchesne said. It is part of the high school American literature curriculum.\n\"In five years I've taught it, I have rarely run into a student who didn't enjoy it,\" he said.\nDarius Diaz, one of the students studying the Fitzgerald classic, agrees.\n\"There is a lot that modern teenagers can relate to, including the idea that love makes people do stupid things,\" Diaz said.\nHolyoke High's Gatsby scholars -- a mix of white and Hispanic students -- are very excited to see the National Players rendition of the story, Courchesne said. Friday's performance will be followed by a discussion and master class run by actors from the touring company, he said.\nOn Saturday, the community at large will have a chance to attend the National Players performance of Fitzgerald's masterwork and a post-show gala beginning at 1 p.m. at the Wistariahurst Museum.\nA raffle for two tickets to Bruce Springsteen's hit Broadway show will be raffled off during the gala.\nThe events are sponsored by OneHolyoke CDC, a nonprofit promoting low-income housing improvement in the city. The $15,000 cost of the high school and community performances was primarily underwritten by People's Bank, with contributions from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and Holyoke's Victory Theater.\nOneHolyoke's Michael Moriarty said the dramatization of Gatsby is a natural for Wistariahurst. Moriarty, the mastermind of the community arts collaboration -- now in its third year -- said, \"What better place to stage 'The Great Gatsby' than Wistariahurst where millionaires actually lived in the 1920s?\"\n\"OneHolyoke is committed to supporting the Holyoke public school system,\" Moriarty said, adding that the school doesn't have the budget and resources to bring a touring company like the National Players to the city.\n\"There is great value in exposing students to the arts,\" Moriarty said, adding that community involvement in Holyoke's school system is very important.\nDavid Langlois, who teaches video production courses at Holyoke High, involved his students by asking them to shoot 30-second video spots to promote the Gatsby performances. Students in Langlois' video journalism course produce news shows and other segments that appear on the school's public access channel.\n\"It was fun to see what they came up with,\" he said of the video shorts. \"Some of the videos highlighted scenes from the novel to promote the performances -- including the scene where Gatsby is shot at his home's swimming pool. The students used GoPro cameras for an underwater views to illustrate the scene.\n\"At its heart, the novel is about authenticity,\" Courchesne said. \"",

        "prompt": "Saudi Arabia’s ambitious plan to transform its economy away from oil has global banks lining up for a piece of the action.\nIt’s already the busiest year ever for merger and acquisitions and financing deals in the kingdom and that’s prompting the world’s top banks to invest in the country in preparation for a highly-anticipated bonanza of commissions.\nUp for grabs will be fees on hundreds of state-asset sales, for example, including the Saudi Arabian Oil Co, which could value the company at a record $2 trillion.\nHSBC Holdings' Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver, Goldman Sachs Group Co-President Harvey Schwartz, BlackRock chief Larry Fink and Credit Suisse Group CEO Tidjane Thiam are among the titans of finance and investing gathering for a three-day summit in Riyadh this week.\nThe occasion: debating the opportunities created by the kingdom’s reform process while mingling with Saudi ministers of finance, energy, and commerce and the head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund.\nJPMorgan: The U.S. lender is the top M&A adviser and top arranger of international bond sales in the country, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank advised the Public Investment Fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber Technologies in June 2106 and worked with Credit Agricole when it sold a $1.5 billion stake in Banque Saudi Fransi to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal last month - the biggest M&A deal this year.\nIt’s also said to have been one of the first banks appointed to advise Saudi Aramco on its planned IPO. And it was among lenders that helped the government raise $9 billion in Islamic bonds in April and $12.5 billion in September.\nThe lender is said to have doubled its investment banking group to about 18 staff over the past year. It named Kapil Chadda vice chairman of its global banking business in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, with a focus on developing business in Saudi Arabia. The bank is advising Saudi Aramco on its share sale, and also is said to be working with the government on privatizing the stock exchange and flour mills.\nGoldman Sachs: The US lender has been making a big push into the kingdom and hired Eyas Al Dossari from HSBC to head its Saudi investment banking operations. It advised Kingdom Holding on its Saudi Fransi stake purchase and is also advising Saudi British on its merger talks with Alawwal. The bank helped arrange Saudi Arabia’s debut international bond sale last October, and the kingdom’s Capital Market Authority has given the bank approval to trade local equities.\nDeutsche Bank: The German lender appointed Saudi national Jamal Al Kishi as CEO for the Middle East and Africa last year. The kingdom is “a promising investment banking market and those banks who like us, are fully licensed, with a long standing presence in the country and local capability on-the-ground are set to continue to perform well,” said Al Kishi.\nThe bank, which employs about 80 bankers in the kingdom, expects fees to rise as it transforms its economy, according to Tamim Jabr, also a Saudi national, who took over as head of Deutsche Bank’s Saudi Arabia securities operations in March. It was among the arrangers for the kingdom’s $17.5 billion dollar bond sale and its first Islamic bond sale. The bank is also preparing to “massively expand” its private banking business in the kingdom, according to Peter Hinder, head of EMEA wealth management.\nCitigroup: The New York-based lender received an investment bank license to operate in the kingdom in April after a 13-year absence. When the U.S. lender opens its office in the country, it will be able to pitch for local advisory work including IPOs and takeovers in which the target company is based in the kingdom. Citigroup lost its license when it sold its stake in Samba Financial Group in 2004 and tried unsuccessfully to return in 2006 and 2010.\nThe bank has already had lead roles on the kingdom’s dollar bond sale last year and Islamic bond sale this year. It’s currently building a team to be based in Riyadh and named Carmen Haddad, previously chief country officer for Qatar, as the head of its business in the kingdom.\nCredit Suisse: The Swiss lender, which counts the kingdom’s billionaire Olayan family as its largest shareholder, was last year in talks with the Saudi central bank for an onshore license. The bank is said to have allocated about $600 million of its own capital to expand its business in the kingdom. The Zurich-based bank, which has a securities and equities business in the country, plans to use the capital to, among other things, offer investors Lombard loans, which are backed by liquid assets such as stocks. Credit Suisse is also planning to hire more private bankers in the kingdom.\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group: Japanese banks are making a big push to do business in Saudi Arabia with MUFG leading the way. Japan’s biggest lender, which currently manages its Saudi business from Dubai, is set to become the first Japanese bank to start full banking operations in the country with a branch in Riyadh as early as next year.\nIt plans to hire as many as 60 people over the next three-to-five years, as it sees privatizations exceeding $350 billion, Elyas Algaseer, co-head in the Middle East and North Africa said in an interview in August. MUFG and its two biggest Japanese peers signed a non-binding agreement with Aramco in August to expand lending to the state-run firm. MUFG may help underwrite the Aramco IPO as it holds a stake in Morgan Stanley, which was selected as lead underwriter with JPMorgan.\nBoutique Banks: Smaller advisory firms have made significant in-roads into Saudi Arabia over the past year. Evercore Inc., the U.S. bank founded by Roger Altman, will work alongside rival Moelis & Co. as a financial adviser on Aramco’s IPO, people familiar with the matter said in March. The firm and New York-based Moelis will help the oil giant pick underwriting banks, make decisions on potential listing venues and ensure the IPO goes smoothly. Rothschild & Co. and Lazard had also pitched for the role. Evercore is said to be planning to open an office in the Dubai International Financial Centre as it seeks new business in the region.\nCredit Agricole: France’s second-largest bank sold half of its 32 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi to billionaire Prince Alwaleed for $1.54 billion last month. Credit Agricole’s corporate and investment bank may sell an additional 5 percent block but says it’s committed to keep about 10 percent. It plans to work with Saudi Fransi as a “strategic partner” while also developing its “direct presence” in the country.\nLocal Lenders: Before drawing interest from global banks, Saudi Arabia’s deal market was dominated by 13 local lenders. As international firms move in “local banks will be net winners from the new M&A and IPO environment because foreign banks will need local partners and trading activity will likely increase",
        "baseline": " a lot,” said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management.\nRBS: The British lender for years tried unsuccessfully to sell its 40 percent holding in Alawwal Bank, which is worth about $1.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s now in talks to merge the business with HSBC’s Saudi British Bank. Alawwal was known as Saudi Hollandi Bank until last year and the venture was acquired by RBS in its 2007 joint purchase of the Netherlands’ ABN Amro, the disastrous deal that helped prompt the U.K. bailout. The new name means “the first” in Arabic, referring to the bank’s 1926 founding as Saudi Arabia’s first bank.\nBarclays: The British lender handed back its Saudi Arabia license in 2014, shortly before a slump in oil prices kick-started the reform process that led to the kingdom opening up to foreign investors.",

Yet the government has been slow to move on the plan, and the sale has been pushed back to 2018.\nIn the meantime, the government has been trying to raise money through other means.

They are good kids.

But to be respectful and great students is awesome.\"\nIt was the first time Plymouth resident Steve Geiger, a 101st Army Airborne veteran who served in Vietnam, came to the program at Dolsen. \"My daughter wanted me to surprise her sons,\" he said, \"I don't usually go to Veterans Day programs but sometimes I do.\"\nGeiger's daughter Courtney Nowicki accompanied him to program which started with coffee and snacks for the veterans. Her sons, fourth-grader Jack and second-grader George, didn't know their grandfather was going to be at the program.\n\"I usually forget about it.

While the update delivers tons of features, there are a few that we think stand out from the crowd.

Android M is the follow-up to last year’s Android Lollipop update and it’s expected to replace the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update sometime in Q3.\nAndroid M won’t be coming to every single device but it will be coming to the Nexus 5, Google’s flagship Nexus smartphone from 2013. The Nexus 5 is no longer the company’s flagship Nexus, that title belongs to the Nexus 6, but it still is an important device in the hands on many people around the globe. Us included.\nWe’ve been using the Nexus 5 since its release in the fall of 2013 and we’ve installed every single update that Google’s thrown at the device.

        "prompt": "To navigate through life, most people rely on their five senses: sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. But if you’re like a lot of spiritual people, you sometimes find yourself relying on a way of knowing that exists beyond the physical senses, using a sixth sense known as intuition.\nYou’ve probably felt the push or pull of intuition. Where does it come from?\nIf you listen to two prominent names in the world of spirituality, author and frequent Oprah show guest Gary Zukav, and the modern day channeler Paul Selig, they will both tell you intuition comes from a non-physical source: spirit guides.\nOther intelligences inhabit other ranges of frequency. They coexist with us but are invisible to us. In the place that you now sit exist many different beings, each active in its own reality. These realities comingle with yours…but are undetectable to the human eye.\nAsk the Universe to “help me to see.” The answers may not always come in the ways that you expect, but they always come. Sometimes in the form of a feeling—a yes or no feeling—sometimes in the form of a memory, or a thought or a dream and sometimes in the form of a realization that is prompted by an experience that will occur the next day.\nThe ability to draw consciously upon your nonphysical guidance and assistance, to communicate consciously with a non-physical Teacher, is a treasure that cannot be described, a treasure beyond words and value.\nHave you heard of Paul Selig? Over the past few years, he has produced a number of channeled books that are dictated to him by a spiritual guide. If like most people, even those with a spiritual bent, you question whether this is too “woo-woo,” I recommend you listen to a podcast or watch a video where this channeling takes place. If Selig is a fraudster, he has put together one fantastic act. With repeated exposure, it has become clear to me that Selig is genuine.\nWriting in his first bookI Am The Word, Selig compares our head to a radio that is constantly being bombarded by various frequencies. (Zukav uses a similar radio analogy.) Often lost in all the noise, is the guidance we receive. If you’re determined to hear this guidance, you must decide that you are aligned to a higher frequency and that’s what your radio is playing. This is the place where your spirit guides communicate with you, offering you guidance and support.\nSelig writes that we all already hear these guides but literally tune them out. The key is to “trust that you",
        "baseline": " have a spirit guide or an angel or guardian or a personal teacher” and believe that these guides are working with you to support your growth. Once you do this, you’ll be better able to tune in to your own higher knowing, resulting in intuitive hunches, feelings and, in some cases, a clear inner voice that tells you precisely what you need to do in any situation.\nI have wisdom now available to me and I will ask myself what I need to know. I have understanding available to me and I will consciously connect to my understanding in a way that will give me the information and knowing that I require.\nDo these spirit guides really exist? Are they here all the time but we just can’t see them because they exist in another dimension? If we believe in them, can we better access their wisdom? Do they work in our lives like proverbial guardian angels? Maybe, but you’ll never know until you try to tune in for yourself.",

He also says that you should read them with your eyes closed, so that you can hear the words as if they are being spoken to you.\nI have read all of Selig’s books and have found them to be very helpful.

        "prompt": "Robert Redford has been kicking off the Sundance Film Festival with an opening day press conference for 34 years, but Thursday, he said he was ready to take a backseat role.\n\"I think we're at a point where I can move on to a different place,\" Redford said. \"The thing I've missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and the filmmakers.\"\nIt's something he hasn't been able to do much with all the introductions he's asked to do. But he said at this point, the festival doesn't need much of an introduction anymore.\nThe first films of the two-week long festival won't premiere until Thursday evening, but the ski town is already bustling with activity as brands and sponsors rush to finish plastering Main Street with logos and installations as the thousands of film fans and filmmakers touch down. Although the temptations in town are many — from flashy virtual reality set-ups and performances from the likes of Arcade Fire, to cozy lounges and filmmaker panels — the films themselves remain the main event for Sundance attendees. The opening night selections are long sold out.\nThe festival officially starts Thursday evening with the premieres of \"After The Wedding,\" an adaptation of Susanne Bier's Oscar-nominated Danish film starring Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore, and \"The Inventor: Out For Blood in Silicon Valley,\" Alex Gibney's documentary about Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.\n\"I hope (audiences) get a deep dive into the psychology of fraud and the psychology of capitalism,\" Gibney said. \"That's what's really interesting to me about this, that journey of why we believe certain stories and why certain storytellers are effective at fooling people.\"\nAlso debuting Thursday night are \"Native Son,\" a contemporary reimaging of the Richard Wright novel, \"Memory: The Origins of Alien,\" about the Ridley Scott film, and \"Apollo 11,\" which has never-before-seen or heard footage from the mission. Opening night films have tended to run the gamut from excellent (\"Whiplash\") to forgettable (\"The Bronze\").\nThe festival this year is host this year to 117 feature films, 105 world premieres and even some retrospectives, including a 20th anniversary screening of \"The Blair Witch Project.\"\nRecent hits that debuted at Sundance include \"The Big Sick,\" ''Get Out,\" ''Eighth Grade,\" ''Sorry to Bother You,\" ''RBG\" and \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?.\" Even with competition from Netflix and Hulu there are still some indies that break out. But lately some of the pricier acquisition deals have not panned out, like last year's \"Assassination Nation,\" which was purchased for $10 million and went on to gross only $2.5 million at the box office.\nKeri Putnam, the executive director of the Sundance Institute, said Thursday that she wanted people to remember that the festival is a non-profit arm of the institute.\n\"At its heart this festival is one of the most important way that we support artists,\" Putnam said. \"This festival is a home for independent artists around the world, to form a collective creative community.\"\nThis year programmers have promised a return to the discovery aspect that Sundance made its name with.

        "prompt": "For the entire 387 minutes that U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met in Geneva last week, a brown manila envelope lay unopened on the table, mute testimony to the breach between their positions. The package contained a letter from President Bush to Saddam Hussein conveying in stark terms Washington's determination to see Iraq leave Kuwait. Baker had given Aziz a photocopy of the letter at the outset of the meeting. As Baker and the 16 other officials present looked on, the Iraqi read the message slowly, his hands trembling. Finally, he said he could not bring such a letter to his leader; it was not cast, he said, in tones appropriate for communication between heads of state.\nWhen the two sides broke for lunch, Baker deliberately left the envelope in the middle of the table, instructing an American security agent to keep an eye on it. As the meeting ended, Baker made a last stab. \"Mr. Minister, I want to ask one more time. Are you sure that you do not want to receive this letter?\" he said. \"Yes,\" Aziz replied. Baker picked up the envelope and left the room.\nThe rest of the meeting was no more productive, though the atmosphere was calm and professional. There was no shouting, no pounding on the table. Aziz politely asked if he could light a cigar, and Baker, a former smoker, just as politely said he would relish the aroma. But neither side had anything new to say. Neither of the men budged a jot from their mutually exclusive positions. Baker said Iraq must quit Kuwait without conditions or face war. Aziz insisted the gulf conflict must be solved in conjunction with all Middle East problems.\nThough Baker, the diplomat, was clearly depressed by the outcome of the discussions, his boss, the Commander in Chief, was unfazed. As Bush aides explained it, the Baker-Aziz conference confirmed the President's expectations without realizing his worst fears. \"Anybody who expected a breakthrough in Geneva was a fool,\" said a White House official. At the same time, the Administration had worried that the Iraqis would spring a dramatic surprise, offering, perhaps, a partial withdrawal, which would have frayed the coalition against Saddam and made Congress less likely to authorize Bush to use force. That Aziz unpopped no jack-in-the-box was a relief to Washington. It was also a plus that the meeting went on so long. Should war finally come, the Administration can now say it seriously tried another way.\nAdministration officials pointed out that while Geneva proved a dead end, it was not the only path to peace. No sooner had Baker, briefing reporters, uttered his first \"regrettably\" than a haggle of diplomats began to accelerate the push for alternative peace initiatives. Among them were efforts by the French, the European Community and the Algerians to act as interlocutors. Most notably, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced he would go to Baghdad to see Saddam. \"The window for peace has not widened, but neither has it been slammed shut,\" said German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.\nIronically, the stalemate in Geneva may make it easier for Iraq to accept someone else's settlement plan. \"Saddam needs to look like he's standing up to the United States,\" said a White House official. \"Slapping us down by refusing to accept the President's letter might help him save enough face to withdraw from Kuwait.\"\nCertainly, the rejection of Bush's letter appeared to have been premeditated. U.S. officials believe Aziz had instructions to spurn anything other than a conciliatory message, though the Minister did study the letter as if to memorize its key parts. In fact, Bush's note was demanding though not recklessly impolite. It did contain one sentence that must have quickened Aziz's pulse: \"Unless you withdraw from Kuwait completely and without condition,\" Bush wrote Saddam, \"you will lose more than Kuwait.\"\nContrary to rumors before the meeting, the Americans did not try to scare Saddam by presenting intelligence reports on his recent movements. The U.S. has such information, collected mainly through electronic intercepts. Because Saddam moves around so much, however, there are periods when Washington is not certain of his whereabouts. But if war breaks out and Saddam is targeted, one American official asserted, the U.S. could attack each of the several locations where he is likely to be.\nTrying to prevent such a showdown is now primarily a job for anyone but the Americans. In Geneva, Aziz reminded Baker, \"You are American. You are not the world.\" Given that sentiment, the U.N.'s Perez de Cuellar appeared to be the most suitable intermediary. \"He is a diplomatic ladder on which Saddam can climb down,\" said a senior French envoy.\nAfter his 0-0 game with Aziz ended, Baker remarked that the U.S. welcomed \"any and all diplomatic efforts to solve this crisis peacefully,\" but he repeatedly singled out Perez de Cuellar's efforts to the exclusion of the others. Washington found comfort in the notion that the U.N. chief presumably would be bound to insist on an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, since that is the demand contained in the 12 resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council since the invasion last August. Perez de Cuellar did bring . Saddam something new to mull over: a formal proposal that once Iraqi troops left Kuwait, they would be replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force that would exclude U.S., Saudi and other troops objectionable to Baghdad. That, at least, would spare Iraq the humiliation of having a massive American force next door.\nAttempts by the E.C., the French and the Algerians to break the deadlock are less appealing to Washington. Last week the Bush Administration rejected a peace plan approved by the E.C. at an emergency session in Luxembourg on the grounds that it provided the linkage Saddam seeks between the gulf conflict and the Palestinian problem. The Community's members had committed themselves to contributing \"actively to a settlement\" of other problems in the Middle East once the gulf crisis is resolved. The U.S. has reluctantly endorsed the idea of eventually holding an international conference on the Middle East but does not want to tie the session explicitly to Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait for fear of rewarding Saddam for his aggression.\nIn any event, the Iraqis have cooled to the E.C. Punishing the Community for revoking an earlier offer to meet him in Rome, Aziz turned down invitations earlier this month to confer in Luxembourg and Algiers with an E.C. delegation headed by Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jacques Poos. The Iraqis suggested a later get-together in Baghdad, but the E.C. declined, calculating that to chase after Aziz would be perceived as a sign of weakness.\nThe French go even further than the E.C. on the question of linkage. They would flatly promise Saddam a Middle East conference in exchange for Baghdad's pledge to give up Kuwait. Paris argues that since it has long sought such a parley, it is actually giving Saddam nothing new. Washington sees it differently. Says French President Francois Mitterrand: \"I respect Mr. Bush, but I do not feel myself to be in the position of a second-class private obliged to obey his commander in chief.\"\nBecause of its record as an effective mediator between Arab and Western countries, Algeria is in many ways well suited to the peacemaker's role. Before leaving Geneva, Aziz met with Algerian Foreign Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali, apparently to no avail. Nevertheless, the Algerians have redoubled their efforts to reach a solution that is essentially based on the French model and that promises territorial concessions from Kuwait.\nLast week the Bush Administration disclosed that Moscow too was \"thinking ) innovatively\" about ways to unravel the gulf mess. President Mikhail Gorbachev surprised his American counterpart with an early-morning phone call to discuss possible outs, which the Administration did not describe. While downplaying these proposals, Washington was gratified that after speaking with Baker about the stalemate in Geneva, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze sent Baghdad his own message, echoing the U.S. contention that Iraq must immediately choose war or peace.\nAs many and as varied as the peace efforts were, none appeared to offer much hope. Late last week Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassim told TIME his country was \"psychologically prepared\" for peace talks. But, he said, Baghdad was sticking to its insistence on linking the gulf crisis with the Palestinian issue, a proposition Washington will not accept",
        "baseline": ". \"There is nothing new on our side,\" said Jassim. \"We have nothing to add.\"\nMany in Washington are convinced that Saddam is playing brinkmanship, and will pull out only when he is absolutely convinced that the Desert Shield coalition is dead serious about forcing him out of Kuwait, and only at the very last second before any assault occurs. As Baker told U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia last week, his fear is that Saddam \"will miscalculate exactly where that brink is.\"\nOne clue from Geneva last week suggested that Saddam still needed a good deal of persuading. According to an intelligence service friendly to the U.S., Barzan Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother and the member of Aziz's delegation closest to the President, pronounced himself unconvinced by Baker's hard line. If Saddam believes his relative, he will see no urgency in accepting any proposal that leaves him with less than he started with, which is all of Kuwait.",

        "prompt": "A bearish trend in U.S. equities was disrupted last Friday on better U.S. employment data, but a recent study on income and poverty shows better employment is benefiting men more than women and unmarried households over married ones.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an increase of 248,000 jobs in September, while employment for August was revised up from a gain of 142,000 to a gain of 180,000. The headline unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, reaching levels last seen in 2004.\nWhile unemployment is down with more jobs, the gains have not made up for population growth in the United States, which has driven the labor participation rate to below 63%. Labor participation rates fell below 63% in late 2013 and have remained below that point for most of 2014, far below the pre-recession high of 66%. The labor participation rate has not been this low since 1978.\nAdditional pressure to the labor participation rate has come from the growing rate of retirement amongst baby boomers, which has driven more elderly people out of the workforce and keeping the ratio of employment to population at extremely low levels. The employment to population ratio remains at 59%, the same rate as the prior month and lower than the 61% rate seen throughout the 1990s and 2000s.\nA decline in the labor participation rate has added deflationary pressures to the U.S. economy, driving long-term bond yields lower. The 10-year U.S. Treasury fell to 2.44% in Friday trading.\nMedian family incomes in the United States barely grew in 2013, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The study showed that family median incomes rose less than one percent from 2012 to 2013.\nThe data also showed some surprising trends that indicate marriage is hindering, rather than helping, individuals’ incomes to rise. The biggest gains came to families with one male breadwinner and no wife, who saw their incomes grow 2.6% year-over-year in 2013. Unmarried and separated women who lead households also saw incomes rise 1.9% year-over-year, over double the gains enjoyed in married households",

Men saw their incomes shrink from $37,527 to $36,876, for a decline of 1.7% in nominal terms and even higher in inflation-adjusted terms.\nThe study also showed that men were 12.2% more likely to work than women and 34.8% more likely to be working full-time and year-round.",

        "prompt": "The Commission on the Voluntary Sector and Ageing issues its final report today. We have called it Decision Time, and if that sounds a little foreboding that’s because it is supposed to.\nOur population is getting older — within two decades, one in four of us will be over 65 — and the voluntary sector, from community charities to multi-million pound national funders, has some serious thinking to do.\nIf they get this right, the potential rewards for the voluntary sector are substantial. The numbers are eye-opening: if people hitting 65 keep donating time and money at the same rate as today’s older population, it’ll be worth the equivalent of £6.5bn to the sector over the next 20 years. It would take another 150 Red Nose Days to raise the same.\nSo by the middle of the 2030s our charities could be flourishing, from extra cash and resources but also from the expertise and experience that these baby boomers will bring. Voluntary organisations could be rich in many ways.\nBut there’s a hitch. In the course of 18 months’ research, the commission found little evidence that the voluntary sector was ready to grasp this prize. We heard two things all too regularly: that such-and-such a charity didn’t work with old people and therefore had no need to think about the ageing population; and that more elderly people means a looming social care crisis – and little else. As I say at the beginning of the report, civil society is gripped by a collective failure of imagination.\nOne thing is clear. If the voluntary sector is to adapt to our ageing population, charities must lead the way.\nAt the most strategic level, some will want to consider gearing up their work across the board. An ageing population will affect every corner of society, so the voluntary sector should too. Today’s children are the healthy, well-adjusted older workers of the future, but only if they get the support now. A bugbear I hear often from middle-aged people, meanwhile, is that charities offer them no support and few opportunities to engage, even as they hit the stresses of the “rush hour of life”.\nOn more day-to-day matters, charities may want to revisit how they work with volunteers: are older volunteers still viewed as an army of little old ladies, fulfilling basic tasks but never engaged at a more detailed, substantive level?\nCharities mustn’t alienate this base of support. Better still, they should market themselves as the perfect sector to retrain, retraining and recruiting older workers.\nThere are practical tips. Charities should take care how they present older people in their advertising and campaigning. It’s a lot better than it",

The short-term gain isn’t worth the long-term damage to how older people are perceived. The voluntary sector should be at the forefront of discussing later life as a success story. The peddling of negative stereotypes must end.\nDecision Time also identifies some important changes from outside the voluntary sector that could help. The Treasury could think about helping individual donors give away their cash as annuity pots are drawn down, for example, and the cabinet office could consider whether reference to “need because of age” in the Charities Act is helpful.\nBut the voluntary sector must lead the way. There is work to be done.",

It’s a call to the government to support the sector in this endeavour. And it’s a call to older people themselves to get involved, to make their voices heard and to make their mark.\nThe voluntary sector has a chance to make the most of the ageing population. It’s a chance to make the most of the experience, expertise and resources that older people can bring. It’s a chance to make the most of the money that older people can give. It’s a chance to make the most of the opportunities that an ageing population can bring.\nBut it’s a chance that the sector must take. It’s decision time.\nThis",

This is patronising and unhelpful. It’s also a missed opportunity: older people are the most generous age group when it comes to giving time and money.\nThere are also some big questions. How can charities ensure they are not only welcoming to older people but also representative of them? How can they ensure that they are not only inclusive but also relevant to older people? How can they ensure that they are not only accessible but also affordable?\nThe report is not a blueprint for how to do this. It’s a call to action.

        "prompt": "Education investments are rarely a simple decision of financial cost-benefit.\nNo matter who you are, there will be financial and personal sacrifices you make while in graduate school.\nEducation investments are rarely a simple decision of financial cost-benefit. To help you decide, I share my personal story of my graduate school financing and a methodology based on my expertise in higher education and the perspectives of other experts.\nTo finance my doctoral degree, I was fortunate to have a tuition benefit, a taxable benefit that allowed me to get free classes with one important caveat: the cost of these classes (with a little over $5k as tax-deductible) was tacked onto my salary as taxable income. Therefore, I paid about a third of the cost of my education, but as a tax to the federal government, not to the college itself.\nOthers aren’t so lucky because they’ve chosen the wrong career, have loans that can’t be paid off and/or salaries that don’t make up for the time and money they invested in graduate education, like this unfortunate story about a law school graduate with $350,000 in student loan debt.\nWhat is the opportunity cost of attending? Graduate school can take you away from full-time work, so you have to take into account your lost wages over the time you’re enrolled in the graduate program. For example, if you’re making $40,000 per year and your graduate program is 1 years, your opportunity cost is ($40,000 * 1 = $40,000). Going part-time for your degree can mitigate its opportunity cost, especially if you’re able to retain a partial or full salary.\nImmediate post-grad salary. There are a number of data sources you can check to learn about post-graduate salaries. Assistant Professor of Psychology, Caitlin Faas, of Mount St. Mary's University, recommends that students check O*Net online, which includes employment projections data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics as well as “average salaries and average education levels for the job you want.” Practice Professor of Higher Education and Director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education, Joni Finney, of the University of Pennsylvania, recommends that students use Georgetown University’s Center for Education and the Workforce, which breaks down projected salary of college graduates on a state-by-state basis.\nExpected lifetime earnings. Faas recommends that students compare the average starting salary to how long it will take to pay back the money for the degree. I recommend that you run a comparison of your lifetime earnings at your current salary without your graduate degree versus your expected future earnings post-graduate degree.\nTuition and living expenses: Out of pocket. Check the net price calculator on an individual college or university’s website to get an estimated total. Then, consult with a financial advisor to see what you can reasonably expect to pay out of pocket. Don’t forget to look for scholarships and grants that may be available through your state and outside organizations.\nYour next step is to plug in your numbers into the formulae in this spreadsheet (example case provided) to see where you stack up financially. How are your numbers looking?\nHow will this graduate degree benefit your life and career in the short and long-term? Will this graduate degree be the most relevant, strategic, and cost-effective step toward your goal(s)?\nIs the graduate degree necessary to enter your field or to get a promotion (and what is the financial value of that promotion)?\nDoes the graduate degree allow you to acquire skills and expertise that would be otherwise unavailable to you through other means?

It allowed me to hit the ground running right away on my business, and to take on a wonderful role at the University of Pennsylvania as Affiliated Faculty in Organizational Dynamics.\nNo matter who you are, there will be financial and personal sacrifices you make while in graduate school.

        "prompt": "Tourists wearing face masks walk through Tiananmen Square in Beijing amid thick smog, Feb. 28, 2013.\nChina's smog crisis may be clearing the way for new anti-pollution policies, although the pace of change remains clouded in doubt.\nOn Feb. 19, a senior Ministry of Finance official raised hopes for change in China's environmental rules with a promise that the government would \"proactively introduce\" new policies, including a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main global warming gas.\nThe new carbon tax would be one of several steps taken to meet China's pledge of cutting 40 to 45 percent of CO2 per unit of gross domestic product by 2020 from 2005 levels, said Jia Chen, the ministry's tax policy chief, according to state news agency Xinhua.\nAn environmental protection tax would replace pollutant discharge fees, while taxes could also be assessed on energy-intensive products and luxury transport, Jia said. Coal taxes could also be raised and reformed.\nSeparately on Feb. 21, the Ministry of Environmental Protection issued a Five-Year Plan to overhaul hundreds of national pollution standards for water, air, soil, ecosystems, and sound, the official English-language China Daily reported.\nSix of the heaviest-polluting industries in 47 cities were required to start \"gradually\" meeting international air pollution standards on March 1, China Daily reported.\nThe producers of thermal power, iron and steel, petrochemicals, cement, non-ferrous metals, and chemicals account for 70 percent of the country's total emissions, said Chai Fahe, vice president of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences.\nThe outpouring of promises is a response to long-standing problems, but it is also the result of a recent coincidence of events.\nChina's cities have been suffering since January under a great ceiling of soot, which is politely called smog, while the government prepares for the spotlight of its annual meetings with its transition of power in March.\nThe government's new measures have drawn international notice with particular focus on the carbon tax, long considered the most effective way to make polluters pay for excess emissions.\nAnalysts have mixed praise for the initiative with concern for how effective it will be.\nPhilip Andrews-Speed, principal fellow in the East Asia program at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute, said a carbon tax could offer advantages over an emissions trading scheme.\n\"A carbon tax makes more sense in China than emissions trading, as the administration of a tax is easier than a trading system,\" he said. Trading emissions credits can also be hard to track with state-owned enterprises, which may be subsidized.\n\"The key challenges are to decide at what level of carbon price the tax should be set and then to collect the tax. Neither of these will be easy,\" Andrews-Speed said.\nMikkal Herberg, energy security research director for the Seattle-based National Bureau of Asian Research, also cited the influence of China's industry lobby.\n\"This all will be one big battle with heavy industry vested interests,\" Herberg said. \"But maybe the pollution debacle will give Beijing a stronger backbone.\nHow much of a tax?\nQuestions remain on the impact and cost.\nOn the issue of the tax level, the concern is that it may be set so low that it will have little effect in discouraging industries from burning more coal.\nIn 2010, finance ministry officials recommended a tax of 10 yuan (U.S. $1.60) per metric ton of CO2 starting in 2012 and rising to 50 yuan (U.S. $8.00) in 2020, Xinhua said.\n\"The tax on carbon would in fact be puny,\" wrote Ella Chou, a clean energy consultant and Brookings Institution senior research assistant in a blog posting cited by the Washington Post.\n\"The point of a carbon tax, be (it) in China or elsewhere, is to set the price signal straight,\" said Chou, who noted that current tax rates have helped make China's coal consumption greater than the rest of the world combined.\nTax collection may also be problematic.\nAccording to Jia, local tax officials rather than environmental protection departments would collect",
        "baseline": " the amounts due.\nThat change is unlikely to keep local officials from promoting energy-intensive industries to boost economic growth, said Chou.\n\"Local governments would continue to come up (with) ways to give industries tax rebates and subsidies to attract them to their own jurisdictions, so the effect of the environmental tax or the carbon tax on the industries would be negligible,\" she said.\nAnother obvious shortcoming is that officials have yet to say when the carbon tax will be implemented.\nThe last major discussion of the carbon tax in China was in August 2009, when the nation's top environmental advisers urged implementation in a 900-page report issued four months before the U.N. climate change conference in Copenhagen.\nThe proposal went nowhere as Beijing argued that Western industrialized nations should take the lead in cutting emissions first.\nThat dynamic may be changing as the result of the smog crisis and pressure on the new government to do something about it, but without further details, the effect is unclear.",

        "prompt": "Director Patrick Lussier and screenwriter Todd Farmer's new Halloween-themed horror flick Trick has just added Omar Epps to the cast which already includes the likes of Tom Atkins (My Bloody Valentine 3D, Night of the Creeps), and Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell). Ellen Adair and Kristina Reyes also star.\nThe story centers on an elusive serial killer, who descends upon a small town annually. He is responsible for gruesome murders year after year, each seemingly unrelated. No one believes this could be the same killer. Epps will be playing the lead role of Detective Denver who has faced Trick once before, having shot and killed him. Or so everyone keeps telling him. However, Denver knows Trick is still out there, and he's coming back for revenge.\nProducer Ellen Wander (Dolan's Cadillac, Spinning Man, Misconduct) stated this.\n\"We are thrilled to get into production with Omar and Patrick and can't wait to have this film be seen by audiences everywhere.\"\nOmar Epps is an actor I think we all know as Phil from Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's Scream 2, but the man has also starred in such late 90's-early 2000's flicks as Against the Ropes, Dracula 2000, Love & Basketball, In Too Deep, The Wood, and The Mod Squad co-starring Claire Danes. Epps kicked off his career alongside Tupac Shakur in Ernest Dickerson's Juice, but mostly nowadays Epps seems to stick to TV with roles such as Dr. Eric Foreman on House and Isaac Johnson on Shooter. The role of Detective Denver in Trick was originally set to be played by Dermot Mulroney (Insidious: Chapter 3, My Best Friend's Wedding) before Epps recently stepped in.\nAs mentioned above, Trick also stars Ellen Adair (Showtime's HomelandBillions, and USA's The Sinner) as Sheriff Lisa Jayne, the sheriff in the small town of Benton who has always considered Detective Denver as her mentor. Cheryl Winston, the only survivor of the latest round of killings in her small town, will be played by Kristina Reyes (Blindspot, Shades of Blue). Tom Atkins plays Talbott, and Jamie Kennedy will play Dr. Steven.\nLussier made himself a name as a director on straight-to-video sequels such as The Prophecy 3: The Ascent, Dracula 2000, Dracula II: Ascension, Dracula III: Legacy, and White Noise 2: The Light. But more impressive still is Lussier's work as an editor. The man was Wes Craven's go-to editor for years cutting such Craven classics as Vampire in Brooklyn starring Eddie Murphy, New Nightmare, Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Music of the Heart, Cursed, and Red Eye starring Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy. On top of those flicks, Lussier also edited Friday the 13th Part 2 and Lake Placid director Steve Miner's Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Guillermo del Toro's Mimic, and David Moreau and Xavier Palud's remake of The Eye.

But that's not all. Farmer also wrote Martin Barnewitz's Messengers 2: The Scarecrow starring Norman Reedus and Claire Holt. Together Farmer and Lussier have created some neo-classics of our genre such as the 2009 remake of My Bloody Valentine 3D starring Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, and Kerr Smith, and Drive Angry starring Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard.\nPrincipal production has begun on the Lussier/Farmer horror thriller Trick in New York with Film Bridge International handling worldwide sales.

        "prompt": "Military vehicles of the Iraqi army take part in an operation against ISIS militants in Gogjali neighborhood in Mosul.\nBAGHDAD/BARTELLA, Iraq (Reuters) — Islamic State fighters retreating in the face of a seven-week Iraqi military assault on their Mosul stronghold have hit back in the last two days, exploiting cloudy skies which hampered U.S.-led air support and highlighting the fragile army gains.\nIn a series of counter-attacks since Friday night, the jihadist fighters struck elite Iraqi troops spearheading the offensive in eastern Mosul, and attacked security forces to the south and west of the city.\nOn Sunday two militants tried to attack army barracks in the western province of Anbar. Police and army sources said the attackers were killed before they reached the base.\nIraqi officials say they continue to gain ground against the militants who still hold about three-quarters of the country's largest northern city which is Islamic State's last major urban stronghold in Iraq.\nOne military source said the militants had taken back some ground, but predicted their gains would be short-lived. \"We withdraw to avoid civilian losses and then regain control. They can't hold territory for long,\" the source said.\nBut the fierce resistance means the military's campaign is likely to stretch well into next year as it seeks to recapture a city where the jihadists are dug in among civilians and using a network of tunnels to launch waves of attacks.\nThis has prompted fears among residents and aid groups of a winter food, water and fuel supply crisis for the million residents still in Islamic State-held areas of the city, and calls to speed up operations.\n\"Daesh (Islamic State) still controls our neighborhood, and the Iraqi forces have not taken a single step forward in three weeks. We're in despair,\" said a resident in Mosul's southeastern district of Intisar, where the army's Ninth Armoured Division has struggled to make gains.\n\"My family and I have been sleeping under the concrete stairs in our house for a month now, afraid of the random bombardment between the Iraqi forces and the Daesh elements,\" he told Reuters by telephone.\nThe capture of Mosul, the largest city under control of Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, is seen as crucial toward dismantling the caliphate which the militants declared over parts of the two countries in 2014.\nSome 100,000 Iraqi government troops, Kurdish security forces and mainly Shi'ite militiamen are participating in the assault on Mosul that began on Oct. 17, with air and ground support from a U.S.-led international military coalition.\nA Reuters reporter in Bartella, about 10 km (6 miles) east of Mosul, saw tanks and army trucks heading toward the city on Sunday. Mud caused by recent rains was hindering movement and there was less artillery fire than in recent days.\n\"For the past two days there was almost no fighting,\" said a man who gave his name as Suleiman, who had fled Mosul.\nPeople fleeing the fighting between ISIS and the Iraqi army in Mosul, shown in Samah district, eastern Mosul, Iraq November 12, 2016.\nA spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Services (CTS) who have been leading the Iraqi army advance in Mosul denied any let-up in the overall campaign.\n\"The operation is continuing on all fronts — there's no halt on any front,\" spokesman Sabah al-Numani told Iraqi television.\nIraqi commanders say they have killed at least 1,000 Islamic State fighters. A government adviser estimated the jihadist group now had about 4,000 fighters in Mosul.\nThe military has not given figures for its own casualties. The United Nations said last week nearly 2,000 members of the Iraqi security forces were killed across Iraq in November - a figure which Iraq says was based on unverified reports.\nThe elite CTS units and the armored division have captured around half of the eastern side of Mosul, which is split down the center by the Tigris river.\nA U.S.-led coalition has bombed four of the five bridges across the river, aiming to stem a flow of suicide car bombers from the west, targeting the army in the eastern neighborhoods.\nOfficers say Islamic State has deployed more than 650 car bombs since the campaign started on Oct. 17 but say the pace of attacks has fallen off.\nThe militants, who have dug in and prepared their defense since seizing Mosul in mid-2014, have also struck with volleys of mortar bombs and used a network of tunnels to target soldiers.\nPeshmerga forces inspect a tunnel used by ISIS militants in the town of Bashiqa, after it was recaptured from ISIS, east of Mosul, Iraq, November 12, 2016.\nIn the Intisar district, the tanks of the armored division deployed there have struggled to adapt to close-quarter urban warfare, and commanders have summoned infantry reinforcement, an officer told Reuters.\nCommanders also hope to stretch Islamic State defenses more thinly, by opening new fronts inside the city.\nThe head of the police rapid response forces, stationed a few miles south of Mosul on the west bank of the Tigris, told Iraqi television on Saturday evening his units were awaiting orders to advance north toward the city.\nFirst they must take",

In recent years, police arrested thousands of people for having taken part in peaceful public protests, even where organizers had made a good faith effort to engage with the authorities about the venue.\nIn some instances, police charged parents with “neglecting parental duties” for allowing their children to attend rallies.

        "prompt": "State lawmakers have unveiled an ambitious plan to reform how counties in California set bail for defendants while they wait for their cases to be resolved or go to trial.\nNew language added Friday to bills by Assemblyman Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) would prevent criminal defendants from having to post money as a condition of release from jail and would shift some power from judges to pretrial services agencies to assess the risks they would pose if allowed out in the community.\nUnder the legislation, each county would have to establish its own pretrial services agency to track inmates, remind them of court dates and develop \"risk-assessment\" tools to determine whether a defendant should be released. The programs, in use in other states, allow court and pretrial staff to use data and other evidence to determine whether a person is a risk to the public or likely to flee their charges.\n\"The bottom line is we are trying to get to the point that the determining factor for pretrial release is not the size of your wallet, but the nature of your risk,\" Hertzberg said. \"Are you a risk to society? Are you a public safety risk?\"\nBonta and Hertzberg said they have assembled a broad coalition of organizations and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to push the bail reform forward. Debate over the issue has raged nationwide and has often been waged in court, with cities and counties across the country facing lawsuits over policies that some legal experts say have turned jails into modern-day debtors' prisons.\nIn California, where at least two federal lawsuits over bail practices are pending, 2015 data from the Public Policy Institute of California found more than 60% of people in county jails were awaiting either trial or sentencing.\nWhen a person is arrested, judges set bail according to a county fee schedule based on the gravity of the alleged crime. Defendants must post the amount upfront or pay a 10% fee to a bond company before they are let go.\nThose who can't afford to do so can remain incarcerated up to an additional 48 hours before they are formally charged and arraigned. A judge then sets the conditions for release before trial, weighing such factors as whether a defendant is a threat to his or her community.\nUnder the proposed legislation, Bonta and Hertzberg said the money bail system would not be completely eliminated, and judges would still have final discretion to use it in compelling cases.\nDefendants charged with violent crimes or certain misdemeanors, including some domestic violence offenses, would continue to be held in jail until their arraignment before a judge. Defendants who commit a crime while they are released when their case is pending would be subject to a hearing.\nBut the legislation would require that bail be set based on a person's income.\n\"We didn't want to have unbridled judicial discretion,\" Bonta said. \"We wanted to provide policy guidance to help determine where that discretion is exercised and how.\"\nThe bills are likely to face tough opposition at the Capitol, where legislation requiring counties to use risk-assessment tools when preparing pretrial reports for inmates has failed in the past.\nSignificant questions remain, such as the cost of the proposed pretrial services to provide inmates with support and monitoring, including the use of GPS devices. And bail bonds companies point to the potential cost to taxpayers. Other opponents argue money bail works, protecting the community while allowing defendants to fight their cases.\nWendy Zamutt, who owns a bail bond business in San Diego, said she is trained to screen her clients and provides support to every one. But the laws must be strict on criminals, she said.\n\"They are not people who forgot to",
        "baseline": " bring their library books back on time,\" she said. \"We can't allow these people to return on a promise. It doesn't work. It has never worked.\"\nCriminal justice advocates counter the proposed laws could lead to long-term savings from keeping fewer defendants in jail. Incarceration expenses vary widely across the state, but counties spend an average of more than $100 per day to jail each defendant, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\nMica Doctoroff, a legislative advocate with the American Civil Liberties Union of California's Center for Advocacy and Policy, said the money bail system is not cost-effective and fuels poverty and racial disparities in the system. It \"is not working for California,\" she said.\nThen there is the human toll, Bonta said. Time in jail can cost someone their car, their jobs, their kids.\n\"Many will take pleas when they shouldn't have been detained in jail in the first place,\" he said.",

        "prompt": "Victor Handwerk's passion for windmills is obvious - a streamlined wind machine towers 70 feet over his neat Walnutport home.\nBut that passion serves a dual purpose.\nWatching the turbine's 33-foot fiberglass rotor churn quietly in the country winds pleases Handwerk's aesthetic sensibilities.\nAt the same time, his fuel oil bills are being ground away with each rotation of the blades - which does wonders for his sense of economics.\nHis windmill, unlike the sail-powered dinosaurs of old or the slatted numbers seen on rural homesteads, is a wind furnace - the latest attempt by modern technology to break the bonds of utility-fueled heating systems.\nInstalled in March of last year, the wind furnace has been generating enough heat to warm Handwerk's home and supply his domestic hot water needs.\n\"The wind turbine is producing much more power than I anticipated and definitely has stopped my furnace from running. In fact, during a windy period in March we shut the turbine down because we couldn'ttake any more heat,\" Handwerk said.\nDuring the recent cold snap that sent temperatures plummeting to sub-zero ranges, the wind furnace kept temperatures in the Handwerk home a moderate 70 degrees.\nHistorically, the wind's kinetic energy has been used to pump water, sail ships and generate electricity. Harnessing that energy for heating purposes began as a study conducted at the University of Massachusetts that was funded by the federal Department of Energy.\nThe wind furnace is a commercial byproduct of that study developed by K.W. Control Systems, a distributor of high performance rotary equipment manufactured by a West German company and a producer of specialized control circuitry used in computer systems.\nHandwerk's wind turbine operates in winds of 5-40 mph, produces 25 kilowatts of electricity when the wind hits 25 mph and has an estimated production life span of 25 years.\nIt ties into his water heating system through a 1,000-gallon storage tank in the corner of his basement. From a small control box mounted on an adjacent wall, Handwerk can monitor output, rotate or tip the blades, or feather (shut down) the unit with the touch of a button.\n\"I looked into this years ago,\" Handwerk said. \"I always liked windmills; I have a lot of books on them, and I always said one of these days there's going to be one in the backyard.\"\nAbout three years ago, he made his first move into wind-powered heat. Handwerk is reticent when it comes to that first outing, saying only that the first unit \"didn't produce the way I wanted it to, so I had to take it down.\"\n\"But this one is fully efficient,\" he added, noting his entire domestic hot water supply also comes from the system.\nK.W. backs Handwerk's claim by saying its prototypes already in operation can produce 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) a year atsites with 8 mph average winds. That, the firm says, is equivalent to 600 gallons of fuel oil or $1,800 in electric heating bills.\nThe higher the average wind speed, the greater the wind furnace's output. For example, a unit functioning in average winds of 14 mph will produce 61,000 kwh a year. The average home in the Northeast uses about 25,000 kwh annually for heat.\nWhile the wind furnace may seem to be a romantic notion put to a pragmatic application, there are two fundamental needs to be satisfied before the average homeowner can watch the sun glint off the rotor blades from the kitchen window.\nOne is the obvious need for wind - lots of it. If winds average less than 8 mph at your home, it's not worth taking the lengthy measurements investing in a turbine.\nIn most areas, winds are generally stronger during the winter months. K.W. sales material says a wind turbine can generate eight-10 times more energy in January than in July, making it a seasonal venture. Summer winds, however, can produce enough energy to heat water through the summer months.\n\"One of the areas we're working on now is Long Island, where winds average 13-14 mph. We're also working in upstate New York, New England and the Adirondacks. It's a start and it's really developing quite nicely,\" said Claude P. Hohne, K.W. marketing and sales manager.\nK.W. will arrange for auditors to evaluate a location for its production potential.\nThe other requirement is a sturdy wallet or credit base. The price tag on a turnkey system, according to Hohne, is $40,000 for locations in the Northeast. The price includes delivery and installation - Handwerk said it took about eight hours to erect his unit - and \"can be financed like any piece of equipment.\"\n\"For a commercial application,\" he added, \"the cost can be offset by federal and state tax credits, as well as five years' depreciation.\"\nResidential buyers are eligible for a 40-percent tax credit, while the commercial user can look for credits up to 25 percent.\nHohne also provided information noting the Internal Revenue Service has not tightened up tax shelters that deal with alternative energy production and could offer credits of 21-25 percent to tax shelter buyers in that area.\nThe economics of wind energy notwithstanding, Handwerk says he researched alternative energy sources before settling on the wind turbine.\nWood stoves were eliminated because Handwerk had grown up with them and \"I wanted to get away from the dirt. And you always have to keep after them.\" Solar heat fell by the wayside because \"you have to have a large storage area.\"\nThe wind furnace, according to K.W. information, is almost noiseless and causes no television or radio interference.\nFor oil and gas hot-water heating systems, the turbine works with a flash boiler and circulator that pre",

Gilbert wrote a senior thesis, entitled “The Word Effect: Effects of the Word Content in the Financial Times on Firms’ Earnings in the U.K.” It talked about robo-trading — that is, automated trades based algorithms — and, predictably, how media coverage affected firms’ earnings. His adviser, finance professor Wei Xiong, told Daily Intelligencer that he didn’t recall much about the former student, who was one of about ten advisees that year.\nOn his alumni information page, Gilbert’s employment history is listed as Bayberry Capital Group, LLC, a real-estate-focused investment group.

        "prompt": "Fallout 4 is the first new game in the series in five years. After such a long wait, it's possible you've forgotten a few key details of the storyline. We're here to help, though.\nHere's a brief recap of some of the key elements from the series.\n\"The Great War\" was the most devastating conflict the world has ever seen. It was also the shortest. Several nations of the world launched their nuclear missiles at each other over the span of two hours. This nuclear shootout seems to have stemmed from Resources War, a two-decade-long conflict over the world's dwindling resources. It's unclear who launched the first missile but maybe it didn't matter. The end result was that most of the world's population was wiped out.\nThe nuclear blasts reshaped the world. They wiped out most plant life and animal life, turning lush wilderness into barren wasteland. Bodies of water were forever contaminated by fallout. The animals that did survive were grossly mutated.\nA small percentage of the world's population managed to survive by taking shelter underground. These remnants of humanity emerged after the bombs stopped dropping to form rudimentary settlements.\nThe Vault-Tec Corporation was commissioned to create 122 Vaults across the United States. These underground facilities were intended to shelter their inhabitants from a nuclear war. Still, these Vaults only held up to a thousand people and many were closed before they hit their maximum capacity so very few Americans were able to ride out the war inside their heavily armored walls.\nEach Vault was designed to stay sealed for a different amount of time. For example, Vault 8 in Fallout 2 opened just 10 years after the Great War so its inhabitants could help restart the surface civilization. Vault 111, however, doesn't open until 200 years after it closes. An optimist might think that the Vaults' openings were staggered like this to improve humanity's chances at survival. After all, who could really say what year it would be safe to recolonize the nuclear wasteland?\nThe truth is, though, some of these Vaults weren't meant merely as shelter. They were elaborate government experiments designed to see how humans would function under extreme conditions. Vault 12's door was designed not to close in order so that the government could find out the effects of radiation on a population. The result was that Vault 12's dwellers were turned into ghouls. Vault 92's inhabitants were subjected to subliminal messages that coaxed them into violent outbursts.\nWhile each Vault was different from the next, all are considered very valuable. They're easily defensible structures and often loaded with supplies. While some Vault Dwellers still live in them even after they've opened, others have been taken over by bandits or other undesirable factions.\nThe Commonwealth is the post-apocalyptic remains of Massachusetts. Like the rest of the United States, it's a shadow of what it once was. However, it was hit by nuclear weapons after many other parts of the country so its inhabitants had more warning of the incoming bombardment. This likely means that more of them reached safe shelter before the bombs hit.\nWhile the Commonwealth might be more populated than other parts of the country, that doesn't mean life is any easier. They still have to contend with mutants, raiders, slavers and other dangers. Plus, the lack of a true government anymore means that there are various factions battling for control.\nThe Commonwealth Institute of Technology was a renowned university that survived the Great War thanks to their underground facilities. These great minds continued their work even after the bombs dropped. Their biggest breakthrough was the development of androids, or \"synths,\" that looked and acted like humans.\nWhile the Commonwealth regarded these synths as merely slave labor, their creations yearned to be free. A sympathetic group of humans known as the Railroad helps them escape from their bonds. They're opposed by the Synth Retention Bureau, a group devoted to recapturing these androids by any means necessary. In Fallout 3, players encountered Retention Bureau agents that had chased an android all the way to the Washington D.C.",

This will make them a considerable foe for any player.\nThere aren't many forces for good in the post-apocalyptic United States. The Brotherhood of Steel, a knightly order formed by ex-military members, is one of them. The group is committed to protecting mankind from mutants and preserving pre-war technology.\nSome Brotherhood members are more helpful than others, though. There are some that seem to value the preservation of the Brotherhood and their collection of technology above all else. Some refuse to trade technology with outsiders.\nThe launch trailer for Fallout 4 revealed that the Brotherhood will be opposing the Institute in the Commonwealth. One Knight in the trailer called the Institute a \"malignant growth\" that needs to be cut out. We'll see whether the Brotherhood is truly concerned about saving the Commonwealth or just covets the technology of the Institute.",

        "prompt": "New teaser videos for John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum confirm that a trailer is coming on Thursday. Released in 2014, the original John Wick introduced Keanu Reeves as the titular reluctant hitman with a near-supernatural presence. The film went on to be a surprise sleeper hit, grossing $88 million worldwide on a modest budget of just $20 million.\nIn the sequel John Wick: Chapter 2, Reeves' character found himself once again being pulled into the world of assassins, but this time the stakes were raised and the mayhem increased. Box office grosses swelled as well, with the movie taking in $171 million worldwide. Director Chad Stahelski, who co-helmed the first film alongside David Leitch before taking on solo directorial duties for Chapter 2, is now coming back for a third John Wick film, as is Keanu Reeves. This time, Wick finds himself on the run with a $14 million price tag on his head and multiple assassins in pursuit.\nThe first teaser trailer for John Wick: Chapter 3 was released back in January, and now a new trailer is confirmed to be arriving on Thursday, March 21. The announcement comes via IGN, along with a set of eight new teaser videos affording a glimpse of the ante-raising action to come when John Wick returns for another go-around. Check them out at the link above.\nThe new set of teasers each focus in on a different character, some making their first appearances in the John Wick universe. First up is Halle Berry's new assassin Sofia, who looks very calm posing with her pair of German Shepherds with the words \"Everyone is Waiting for John Wick\" emblazoned on the screen. Next up is another Oscar-winning new cast member, Angelica Huston as The Director, a member of the mysterious High Table. Also waiting for John Wick is new cast member Asia",

The final four teasers preview returning characters: Ian McShane's Continental Hotel proprietor Winston, Laurence Fishburne as Wick ally Bowery King, Lance Reddick as Charon, and of course John's dog.\nIt remains to be seen what role each of the above characters will play in the new story, but it's safe to assume that things will turn out to be very violent. The first John Wick was indeed a blood-soaked story, but the sequel ramped up the mayhem even more, featuring even more elaborate Hong Kong-style fight choreography.

Since then, there has been massive speculation as how long he'll actually be playing the Dark Knight, with CinemaBlend and other publications listing the possible replacements and exit strategies for Bruce Wayne.

Whilst this might be a reasonable decision, which is supposed to encourage Apple's customers to switch to more secure VPN protocols, it is understandable that some of the users may be facing some inconveniences due to it, at least temporarily.\nTo access the PPTP VPN connection will, however, be possible using Shimo, the VPN client for Mac, which is ready for macOS Sierra.

Shimo 4.1 now easily handles complex VPN networking configurations, including route management and DNS handling.\nThis VPN client for Mac guarantees highest security standards and delivers an optimized user experience. It also goes above and beyond by allowing you to automatically connect VPN accounts based on certain trigger conditions. All you have to do is to choose the condition that fits best.

What’s more, our increasing consumption of bottled water—more than 22 gallons per U.S. citizen in 2004 according to the Earth Policy Institute—fuels an unsustainable industry that takes a heavy toll on the environment.\nApproximately 1.5 million barrels of oil—enough to run 100,000 cars for a whole year—are used to make plastic water bottles, while transporting these bottles burns even more oil.The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.\nNearly 90 percent of water bottles are not recycled and wind up in landfills where it takes thousands of years for the plastic to decompose",

Yes, it was in Hastings, right on the English Channel. Her dad, my Grampa, had gone to Canada to find a new home for the family, in a land where the streets were paved with gold. As she and her mother, my Grannie, waited to hear from him, they loved to walk on the beach….cockles and mussels…Punch & Judy Shows…. fish and chips…..sand between the toes….oh, the memories of it all.\nNow Gracey must have been twelve years of age when Grannie got the news and the two of them made the long trip, by boat and by train, to their new home in Portage la Prairie. It was not too hard to get to know the new children at the old Central School and at Sunday School at St. Mary’s Anglican Church, but she did miss the seaside.\nHow she liked to tell of the time that the Sunday School decided to have the annual picnic at Delta…. how they took the train (yes, the train used to run up to Delta!)…. through all the fields of ripening grain…. and to finally see all that water again. Only then, she felt, could she settle down and become a real Canadian.\nAfter Gracey found Dad and my brother and I, and not having a car, our little family seldom got to go out to Delta.

Some well-to-do folk went up to Clear Lake, though Black’s Lake and Lido Plage were closer. Anyone remember Hidden Valley…..where was it?

        "prompt": "According to a 2013 report by the United Nations Global Compact, 65% of companies are developing sustainability policies at the CEO level, but only 35% are taking action.\nThat seems surprising, but it really shouldn't be. After all, how would anyone know? When consumers aren't empowered to hold companies accountable for their sustainability efforts, it's no wonder there's such a gap between intention and action.\nSome companies, though, are trying to be more open with consumers — using their websites to share data about corporate sustainability, and inviting people into the conversation. One company that's leading that trend is Timberland.\n\"Transparency is what it's all about,\" says Mark Newton, vice president of corporate social responsibility for the footwear manufacturer. \"It's about making sure you practice what you preach.\"\nNewton compared making sustainability data available to including nutrition labels on food. Rather than leaving it up to companies to make claims of how green or responsible they are, the data allows people to see what a business is made of and draw their own conclusions. Besides, he added, if the company is generating the information anyway for their own use, why wouldn't they share it?\n\"In order to manage something you have to measure it,\" said Newton. \"We feel it's in the best interest of the company to share how we're doing at those things.\"\nAnd share, they do. The Timberland Responsibility site is a wealth of information about what Newton describes as a holistic approach to responsibility, including environmental efforts, community engagement, and employee conditions and treatment. The site features information on Timberland's responsibility strategy, reports, factory information, product facts, and environmental actions.\nUnder the \"Factories\" tab, for example, site visitors can view a map of factory impacts, an explanation of their sustainability measurements, and more. A chart detailing factory conditions reports the results of an audit, and illustrates the percentage of factories that receive varying degrees of acceptability. Accompanying text explains how the Timberland Supplier Sustainability Team works with the factories to address issues, understand root causes, and help them move into compliance.\n\"We're very detailed,\" Newton said. \"We've made a decision to present more information than most companies would, but we don't want to overwhelm [consumers] either.\"\nWhile all of the data is helpful and telling, Newton said another section of the site, where stories are told, really helps customers connect with Timberland's sustainability efforts. A story archive, a blog, even podcasts of stakeholder engagement calls, allow Timberland to paint a multi-dimensional picture of their responsibility and sustainability efforts.\n\"We're trying to lead with stories,\" said Newton, \"things that can really grab somebody in terms of being real or authentic issues.\"\nWhere things get really interesting is Timberland's Voices of Challenge forum, in which people from other organizations are invited to discuss tough issues of sustainability, and the public gets to weigh in.\n\"If you can do something like this right, it's a very interesting place to be,\" Newton said. \"This is hard stuff. We don't have all the answers.\"\nAdmitting that and opening up the conversation to consumers builds a much deeper trust than even the most comprehensive data site a company could make. The fact that Timberland is hosting these conversations is a testimony in and of itself; while they may not be perfect, they are working to improve. Not to mention that it helps consumers know when other brands' claims aren't matching up with their reality.\n\"It's created a conversation,\" said Newton. \"I think it's awesome, even when companies are greenwashing, because now you get called out on that stuff, and",

Though the company claims it has a long way to go, it has long been hailed as an industry leader for transparency with regard to their sustainability efforts.\nCorporateRegister.com said of the company, \"Timberland has to be one of the most impressive, innovative, transparent and visionary companies in the world where sustainability and sustainability reporting is concerned.\"\nThat's a pretty solid endorsement. Newton said the more companies that get on board with transparent reporting of their sustainability efforts, the better — not just because it's good for business, but also because it creates awareness about corporate responsibility, which is good for everyone.\n\"When consumers start to demand it more, we're going to see larger, more impactful change,\" he said. \"When you unleash that across the private sector, that's very powerful.\"",

This was different. A new concept. We weren't afraid to take a chance on it and kids responded. I think they were looking for something different. We offered it to them and it's been a success story.\"\nThat’s why three times a week, Cecil Tyrrell Whisenton, the owner of Human Healthy Vending, must trek to the school on Navajo Street on the city’s South Side and restock the machines.\nIt’s a good sign, according to Whisenton.\n\"This year, they got rid of most of their snacks because they had to comply with new USDA standards, so that fell in line with what we were doing.

        "prompt": "'La La Land' seriously misunderstands music. So why are its songs pretty great?\nTo prepare for the role of Sebastian — the hardheaded jazz preservationist in Damien Chazelle's \"La La Land,\" which is nominated for a record-tying 14 Oscars at Sunday's Academy Awards — Ryan Gosling says he spent three months learning to play piano.\n\"It's a lot of time alone, and you become quite anti-social,\" he told ABC's \"Nightline\" of the experience. \"Every time I tried to have a conversation during that rehearsal period with anybody, it was a bit like Bambi on ice.\"\nHe needn't have taken it quite so seriously.\nA lavish movie musical set amid Los Angeles' young creative class, \"La La Land\" is dimmest in its depiction of how musicians think and behave. Whenever we see a character pick up a horn or sit down behind a piano — or even open his mouth to hold forth on the supremacy of the past — the film bogs down in childish clichés about compromise and authenticity.\nBut here's the curious thing about this polarizing movie that gets so much wrong about the purpose and value of art: When \"La La Land\" uses music in the manner of the classic musicals it's obviously emulating — not to put us inside a world but to take us out of one — the movie achieves liftoff.\nYou get a sense early on that \"La La Land\" is going to have problems when it shows us Sebastian debasing himself for a paycheck at a party in the Hollywood Hills. By this point, we're already meant to understand that he's a genuine artist, yet here he is forced to play keytar in a cheesy '80s-pop cover band — a humiliation made only worse by the arrival of Mia, a woman he'd like to impress, played by Emma Stone.\nThere's no mistaking the tone of pity in this scene. But the cover band sounds great blazing through \"I Ran\" by A Flock of Seagulls. As a viewer, you identify with miserable Sebastian far less than you do the tipsy, half-dressed starlets cheering from the swimming pool.\nYet \"La La Land\" asks you to distrust your reaction — to accept the movie's outdated idea that pop isn't worthy of respect.\nThis screwy value system asserts itself again in a scene where Sebastian, performing with the slick soul-funk band he's joined at the invitation of his old frenemy Keith (played by John Legend), ignites a crowd with the very tepid \"Start a Fire\" — a clear indication of how out of touch Chazelle is with the real-world pop he so eagerly denigrates.\nThen there are the countless instances of Sebastian mansplaining the importance of jazz — \"pure jazz,\" as he puts it, without elaborating — to Mia, whose blank expression could be taken as welcome skepticism if the film allowed the character to express an opinion of her own.\nThis stuff isn't just insufferable; it's unrecognizable as an attitude anyone in 2017 might adopt.\n\"La La Land\" is hardly the first movie to misunderstand music. Most films about this wonderfully complicated subject have trouble capturing how music works, including Chazelle's previous project, \"Whiplash,\" which demonstrates the abuse a young jazz drummer is willing to take from a sadistic teacher without demonstrating why he's willing to take it.\nBut few movies as dumb about music as this one are also as alive to its emotional potential.\nIn scenes where the film's characters aren't the ones making noise — where a song simply materializes because that's what happens in a musical — \"La La Land\" throbs with sensation, be it the opening sequence set on an L.A. freeway (\"Another Day of Sun\"), a number in which Mia and her girlfriends get ready for a night on the town (\"Someone in the Crowd\") or the gorgeous dream ballet near the end of the movie (\"Epilogue\") in which Sebastian and Mia float through an imagined version of their life together.\nMost effective of all might be \"Audition,\" a solo for Stone that she performs largely in close-up, her face cycling through nearly every conceivable feeling as the music keeps swelling and receding.\nAre these elaborate production numbers helped along by filmmaking razzle-dazzle? Of course. There's also the ample star power of two headliners who can't really sing or dance (but can gaze like nobody's business).\nYet with their swooping melodies, lively rhythms and lush Old Hollywood arrangements, Hurwitz's songs — the best ones, anyway — are doing plenty of the work here. And they're doing it in a knowing, hybridized way that undermines Sebastian's stultifying obsession with purity.\n\"La La Land's\" music director is Marius de Vries, who's known for his production on records by such genre-indifferent performers as Madonna and Björk — not to mention his involvement in Baz Luhrmann's \"Moulin Rouge,\" that postmodern movie musical with all kinds of smart things to say about how pop music functions in people's lives.\nSome have suggested that the sophistication of \"Someone in the Crowd\" and \"Audition\" should lead us to conclude that Sebastian's laughable position on music isn't necessarily the position of the film.\nThe director himself tried to make that case recently on NPR's \"Fresh Air,\" saying, \"I definitely don't personally endorse or espouse Ryan Gosling's character's views.\" Chazelle added that he",
        "baseline": " conceived of Sebastian as a version of his close-minded younger self, when his \"idea of art was very exclusionary.\"\nBut that's not terribly convincing. For one thing, \"Whiplash\" upholds the same moral absolutism as \"La La Land\" in its portrayal of a kid who looks at music as a fortress to be defended.\nHow many more movies about unsmiling jazz musicians can we expect from Chazelle before he cops to sympathizing with their grim determination?\nBut consider too the vision of artistic fulfillment that \"La La Land\" ultimately provides, after that beautiful dream ballet ends and we're dropped back into a years-hence reality, where Sebastian is behind a piano at the nightclub he's always wanted to open.\nThe camera starts tight on the keys, then pulls back and reveals our hero, still somber but finally playing just what he wants — a success not because he's happy but because he stuck to his guns.",

It has awarded the contract to Finland’s Tieto after the original contractor was ruled out because of a legal technicality.\nThe public tender for the deal was initially won by Norwegian IT firm Evry in 2016, but after a complaint and a court ruling, the contract has been awarded to Finnish IT services provider Tieto.\n“We are pleased that we now, together with Tieto, can embark on our project to implement the next generation of IT services for the city’s administration and municipally owned companies,” said Ann Hellenius, CIO for the City of Stockholm.\nThe decision follows a Swedish court of appeal ruling in October that Evry’s bid should not have been included in the public tender because of a seemingly minor administrative error by the Norwegian company.\nThe IT firm submitted its bid as a group with Evry Ab and Evry Norge As.

        "prompt": "If you've ever felt like this, then welcome to the club — the Impostor Syndrome Club. Obviously, you're in good company.\nThe impostor syndrome is known to afflict not only the rich and famous but many successful executives as well. Primarily career-based and achievement-driven, it is a phenomenon where people are unable to own their accomplishments or value, despite evidence to the contrary.\nThe sufferer has a nagging fear of being found out as a fake and a phony, as if they've fooled everyone into believing that they are competent. Any and all success feels completely undeserved and dismissed as luck, timing, or something other than talent, intelligence, hard work, and perseverance. Many professionals have a respect that they feel is not earned, and a title that they feel they don't live up to.\nSome experts say it's cultural; some say it's psychological. This expert (and sufferer) says, \"Who cares?\" It's painful and chronic. It's the most awful, sinking feeling that is the height — and depth — of insecurity.\nAlthough everyone feels doubt and anxiety at times, this syndrome causes a constant cycle of shame and embarrassment, and manifests in self-defeating thoughts that amount to one thing: \"I am not worthy.\"\nAnd yes, the biggest deceiver in all of this really is us: Not in how we believe we lie to others, but in how we lie to ourselves. You see, impostors tend to mistake feelings for facts. But, feelings, unlike facts, lie — and they lie often.\nUnderstanding this is an important step in letting go. By recognizing the lies we tell ourselves and challenging them, we gain perspective, clarity, and confidence.\n1. You tend to focus on the one thing that's wrong rather than what's right.\nWhen I was hired to lead operations for a technology startup, I was brought onboard for my leadership and operations skills: my ability to structure and unify a team, point them in the right direction, and execute strategy. Yet, my focus was my abysmal lack of technology skill. I was beating myself up constantly over this one point. The fact that I had a long, successful career was lost on me. I was too busy feeling defective.\nWe are drawn to and focus on the negative instead of the positive. Anxiety and fear just seem to feel more natural to us, and often, become habit. Whatever we focus on only intensifies, so try focusing on the good.\n2. You think it's too easy — that anyone could do it.\nI have a friend who is terrific at technology. He can write code, design websites, repair computers, and do a million other techie things. I think he's amazing. He thinks a monkey could do it. When you know what you're doing, it seems effortless. And it is — to you. What you may think is nothing is really something to someone else.\nWe don't understand that certain things come more naturally for us, and not for others, and so we devalue our gifts. Never assume that your own unique talents are easily duplicated.\n3. You think it has to be difficult to be worthwhile.\nSome of us are taught this at an early age by struggling for love and attention from one or both of our parents. They withhold love until we prove ourselves worthy. Since their love and approval means everything to us, we think that we have to fight for everything worthwhile in life. In fact, sometimes, we over complicate things just to compensate for anything that should be easy. It's exhausting, and time to stop.\nForgive your parents. They were doing their best and relying on what they were taught. Because the lies we tell ourselves are often inherited, forgive yourself, too.\n4. You believe that what you're doing is never enough.\nIn trying to satisfy that inner need for recognition, we set unrealistic expectations. We also compare ourselves to others and think that we have to struggle to measure up. This paradigm means that we can only feel worthy when we are achieving, as that's what it takes to get positive attention.\nIn the Harvard Business Review article, \"How to Keep A-Players Productive,\" Steven Berglas discusses the \"extraordinarily punishing superegos\" of overachievers such as Winston Churchill, who \"voluntarily push themselves to extremes.\" Churchill was enormously self-critical, reviewing everything in his head that he failed at, a ritual he learned at a young age from his abusive father.\nOften, our self-critical, punishing voice is not our own, but one we've heard, loved and trusted more than our own selves.\nWe forget that no one is all achieving, in all possible ways, all the time.\n5. You need the secondary gains, because you get something out of staying this way.\nOften, we stay in the impostor state for a reason — even if we're unaware of it. Sometimes, it pushes us to do our best work. In fact, I would hazard to guess that it's the motivation that drives Maya Angelou each time she sits down to write a book. We become our own competition, always playing against ourselves.\nI tended to prepare myself for failure, so it wouldn't hurt as much if it actually happened. After the traumatic experience of getting laid off from a job I had and loved for years, I would protect myself with this psychological safety net.\n6. You're not in the moment because you're too busy feeling and not doing.\nWhen we allow our thoughts to wander, we can often over-think, over-analyze, and feel lost. It is then that we see only the emotional and not the practical, and our overly-conscious selves can throw us off — and possibly out — of our game. We're so focused on the fear that we lose the moment, and that's where we really need to be.\nSports psychologist Harvey Dorfman helped baseball legends address fear by being and doing more in the present and talking and thinking less about the past or future. His mantra was \"see the ball, hit the ball.\"\nIf we allow ourselves to be too self-conscious, we're too busy feeling instead of doing. We get ahead of ourselves with too much anticipatory anxiety and miss the moment. For impostor syndrome, doing is the best antidote. When we're in the doing, we have no time to criticize ourselves.\n7. You don't have perspective, and need to take a step back.\nPerspective matters.

Calxeda's technology has also been used in Hewlett-Packard's \"Project Moonshot\" low-power server platform.\nThe sincerest compliment for Calxeda may have come when Intel rolled out its own many-core server products and AMD acquired SeaMicro and got its own license to build ARM-based server chips.\nUnfortunately for Calxeda, timing and not a lack of technological prowess may have been its downfall, according to Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy. The company hasn't detailed the specific reasons it's shutting down. But it is pretty common knowledge that Calxeda's 32-bit product portfolio struggled to compete in broad market segments with 64-bit, x86-based chips capable of accessing more memory that have become the key drivers of back-end computing.\n\"Calxeda was literally the pioneer in fabric and ARM-based servers.

        "prompt": "Much is being made of Leonard Bernstein’s centenary this month – concerts, tributes, even a Google doodle. But I know of only one related event that took place just a few minutes’ walk from the composer-conductor’s grave: a two-piano concert by Christina and Michelle Naughton, twin-sister pianists, at the Green-Wood Cemetery Catacombs in Brooklyn, NY.\nThe event, part of a remarkable series called The Angel’s Share, began with a reception followed by a humid, torch-lit hike through the night-black cemetery – these walks seem much longer in the dark! – to the cooler Catacombs. Two pianos had been placed centrally in the damp, narrow, arched corridor with rows of seats fore and aft.\nAfter series curator Andrew Ousley introduced the pianists, I unconsciously expected them to emerge from the dark crypts to either side – it was that kind of night and that kind of setting.\nOpening and closing with Bernstein, the challenging program alternated between American and French composers with works scored for either piano four-hands or two pianos.\nBernstein’s Candide overture lends itself well to the four-hands treatment. (I remember playing music from the opera arranged for wind ensemble in high school – my first exposure introduction to the music of Leonard Bernstein.) As its familiar melodies and motifs flooded the stone-grey hall, the sisters’ synchrony became immediately clear, playing their subtle rubatos as one.\nSound carries brilliantly loudly in that narrow, hard space. From a front-row seat the sound of two Yamaha pianos with their bright sound is almost too much, especially when the music leaps into a high register. Of course, we don’t expect perfect acoustics in non-traditional spaces. And a concert event in Green-Wood Cemetery is a magical experience start to finish, not an illustration of the finer points of classical-music connoisseurship.\nThey showed off in a different way with Colin Nancarrow’s “Sonatine.” I had never heard Nancarrow’s music played live by human pianists, and with good reason. Known for writing incredibly difficult music meant for player pianos, in this rambunctious piece he afflicts human hands with almost-impossible rhythmic changes and odd meters requiring extreme precision and jet-focused energy. Though these passages are broken by slower, bluesy passages, they quickly explode back into kaleidoscopic splinters. I was literally shaking my head in wonder by the end of the performance.\nDebussy’s “En Blanc et Noir” was another showpiece with its darkness, lightning strikes, celestial harmonies, and the forceful, dissonant phantasmagoria of the remarkable second movement, which the composer dedicated to a friend who had died in World War I.\nFinally, they brightly conveyed the good-natured spirit",

Returning for an encore, they gave a strong yet sensitive reading of the classic “Simple Gifts” from Copland’s Appalachian Spring.\nGiven the technical brilliance and ironclad power these pieces call for, it’s not surprising that youthful flash dominated some elements of the program. But a mature emotionality also emerged, especially in the French pieces. These sisters are more than excellent musicians. Together they are a phenomenon – performing the whole program by heart, locking together with an almost unearthly connection, making the monstrously difficult look easy, and generously taking the audience on a journey through their own musical universe.\nVisit The Angel’s Share for a schedule of Catacombs concerts and for tickets.

That finding is buttressed by a new Politico–Morning Consult poll, which puts Trump’s disapproval rating at 57 percent, the highest it has ever been in that pollster’s research.\nNotably, these figures aren’t drastically worse than the president’s typical poll numbers. A majority of Americans disliked Trump on the day he was elected, and have continued to dislike him ever since. Nonetheless, even marginal declines in Trump’s base of support would likely be enough to nullify his hopes of reelection, given how narrowly he eked out an Electoral College majority in 2016.\nMorning Consult’s poll, meanwhile, finds that 54 percent of Americans blame Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown, while just 35 percent blame congressional Democrats. Notably, the percentage blaming Trump has climbed by 6 points in that survey since the shutdown began, suggesting that the president’s prime-time advocacy for his position failed to win hearts and minds. The survey also shows that 49 percent of voters oppose the construction of a border wall in any circumstances, compared to 43 percent who support it.\nThese results should matter to the president. His decision to inflict financial hardship on hundreds of thousands of Americans, reduce economic growth, undermine public health, and jeopardize border security — for the sake of coercing Congress into voting for a wall that a majority of Americans oppose — has never been popular. But it’s growing unpopularity should disabuse the White House of the idea that it would eventually win (at least) the entirety of the GOP electorate over to its view of things. Trump could have made Nancy Pelosi’s life difficult. Like past presidents who suffered midterm rebukes, he could have triangulated and pushed for the passage of a minimum-wage hike and infrastructure package — thereby forcing Democrats to choose between opposing popular policies and giving Trump bipartisan “wins.” Instead, he has opted to provide the public with a weeks-long affirmation of Democratic attacks on his capacity to govern. Even if he manages to extract his ransom by the end of this, Trump will (almost certainly) emerge from the shutdown with bleaker prospects for reelection than he did late last year.\nBut the president is not a rational political actor. He is a narcissistic Fox News addict who craves nothing so much as his favorite television hosts’ affirmation. He is courting Rush Limbaugh’s approval, not that of swing voters in the Milwaukee suburbs. From the first day of his presidency, he has made clear that he believes his job is to aid those Americans who’ve demonstrated loyalty to him, not the public as a whole (let alone to the majority who reject him). And he is also ostensibly aware that his indifference to the fate of most Americans gives him a peculiar source of leverage in the present standoff. Democrats care about the plight of unpaid federal workers (not least because they are in the aggregate a Democratic constituency), food-stamp recipients, and various other Americans whose basic needs are threatened by a prolonged shutdown. Trump, by contrast, recently orchestrated the mass psychological torture of migrant children; he is not going to be moved by humanitarian concerns.\nThe president’s intransigence may further erode his popular",

But it could also plausibly increase pressure on Democrats to pay the terrorist’s ransom: While a large majority of voters in CBS News’ poll favored reopening the government without wall funding, 52 percent also suggested that they’d prefer Democrats to fund the wall for the sake of reopening the government, if that is what it takes.\nAll this said, even if the new poll numbers make no impression on the president, they make one on the mainstream media. It is now clear that the president is sabotaging the functioning of the federal government in defiance of a supermajority of the public’s will. His substantive argument for the necessity of the border wall is incoherent; his claims of concern for border security belied by the shutdown’s corrosive impact on the security of America’s borders. His demand has no popular, substantive, or procedural legitimacy. There is no reason for “objective” media outlets to pretend otherwise.",

        "prompt": "Easy Food Stamps aims to be the TurboTax of SNAP applications on your phone.\nIn today’s lopsided economy, nearly 15% of American households struggle with providing food for their families, and the number of working households receiving food stamps alone has more than tripled over the last decade. But for the people whose paychecks don’t add up enough to feed the kids, or for those struggling to find work, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) application process itself–often a long and inscrutable document–can sometimes make seeking aid difficult, too.\nSlogging through bureaucratic paperwork doesn’t seem like a task for a smartphone at first. But when Jimmy Chen walks me through Easy Food Stamps, his mobile website that functions something like a TurboTax for SNAP applications, using a smartphone middleman to translate terms like “deemor expenses” into plain English begins to make a lot more sense. Chen, a fellow at social impact incubator Significance Labs, developed the tool with three other Significance team members for New York City SNAP applicants. It goes live today.\nThere’s actually quite a bit of evidence supporting the idea that such a tool should go on smartphones. Gone are the days when earliest-adopted computer phones functioned as flashy status symbols for the tech elite. Now, they’re everywhere. According to a Pew Research Center survey published last fall, more than two thirds of cell-phone owners use their devices to go online. More than a third of those do it with their phones more often than they do with computers. Of that group, low-income Americans make up one of the biggest phone-first demographics.\nYoung people in particular, Chen adds, would likely benefit from something like Easy Food Stamps. (After all, think about all the un- or underpaid interns of the world.) “It’s best-suited for people typing in their information on their phone,” Chen adds.\nThat said, using the mobile space for good does have some baggage attached to it. If Chen and his colleagues, who collectively call themselves Propel, want to make money from the app (which spits out a completed form at the end for Propel to mail), they could reach out to non-profits and see if those groups might pay for institutional use of the software. Or, like Facebook and lots of other mobile platforms,",

Earlier this year, a Senate report found that data brokers crawling apps and web traffic for demographic identities sometimes lump people into categories like “ethnic second-city struggler” or “fragile families.” It’s not difficult to see how that kind of label could be abused or be used to discriminate or manipulate behavior.\nChen says that monetization still remains a far-off concept. But he does agree that mobile technology tends to favor the needs of the relatively comfortable rather than the underserved. That’s much of the reason why Chen left a two-year stint at Facebook to come work at Significance earlier this year.\nTo check out Easy Food Stamps’ Kickstarter campaign to fund the next steps of the project, click here.",

Right now, Propel is just trying to get the word out about the app, and Chen says he’s not sure how they’ll make money yet. Zuck’s got a few years on him, though, so he’s got time to figure it out.

That’s why lawmakers voted to allow people, like Lazor, to substitute medical cannabis for addictive pills.\nCritics worry more needs to be done to study the long-term effects of using pot.\nFor Michelle, though, she said it’s been life changing.\n“I’m working, I’m getting out of the house.

        "prompt": "Since 2013, the Global Green Growth Institute has been working with the government of Indonesia promoting green growth. IPS correspondent Kanis Dursin interviewed Indonesia Deputy Country Representative Dagmar Zwebe about the country's steps in mitigating climate change.\nJAKARTA, Jul 25 2018 (IPS) - The South Asian nation of Indonesia is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouses gases (GHG) and is ranked as the world’s second-largest plastic polluter of oceans, just behind China. So when the country committed in the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in average global temperatures to below 2°C by unconditionally reducing its emissions by 29 percent with using its own finances and by 41 percent with international funding, many felt the goals too ambitious.\nThe World Resources Institute (WRI), in a study on what is required for the country to reduce its emissions as promised in the Paris Agreement, noted that more ambitious actions would be necessary in order to meet the targets – referred to as nationally determined contributions or NDCs.\n“For Indonesia to achieve both its unconditional and conditional NDC targets, more-ambitious mitigation actions will be necessary. Our analysis suggests that the key areas of increased ambition should be strengthening and extending the forest moratorium policy, restoring degraded forest and peatland, and increasing energy conservation efforts,” WRI said.\nThe Global Green Growth Institute, which has a mandate to support emerging and developing countries develop rigorous green growth economic development strategies, has been assisting this Asian nation draw up its national green growth roadmap. GGGI focuses on assisting countries in achieving quality economic growth through less stress on the environment and natural capital.\n“As the country aims to become a high-income country in the 2030s, continued rapid economic growth is required. Without adopting green growth approaches, Indonesia, already the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and the largest contributor of forest-based emissions would only pollute the world more,” Indonesia deputy country representative Dagmar Zwebe told IPS.\nHowever, private sector involvement, strengthening of national policies and regulation on land use are required to bring the country closer to its targets.\nQ: GGGI helped Indonesia draw up its national Green Growth Programme. Tell us more about the roadmap and how you chose the priority sectors?\nThe roadmap helps Indonesia chart a course toward a sustainable economy and focuses on energy, sustainable landscape, and infrastructure. These priority sectors were selected based on multi-stakeholder consultations, involving many government agencies and ministries, including advice provided by the Green Growth Programme Steering Committee.\nQ: Briefly, what green initiatives has GGGI introduced in each of the priority sectors?\nAt the policy level, the national government and two provincial governments are now working to mainstream green growth in planning processes. For projects, GGGI designed a hybrid solar photovoltaic (PV) project combining an existing diesel-based power grid with solar PV in eight locations in East Nusa Tenggara. The facilities would reduce diesel consumption by 236 million litres or the equivalent to a total reduction of 549,300 tonnes of CO2 emissions and potential savings for state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara of around USD125 million over 20 years.\nIn the forest and land-use sector, Central Kalimantan has now formed public-private partnerships for rewetting, replanting and revitalisation of peat landscapes, while in the infrastructure sector, GGGI helps develop bankable green infrastructure projects, especially in special economic zones.\nQ: Has there been any difficulty faced in implementing the programme?\nOne of the difficulties faced is that often the general public, in all sectors, associate green developments with more work or more barriers, decreased returns, and slower developments.\nQ: What is needed to drive private investment in green initiatives?\nJust for example, the current administration has put infrastructure development as one of the country’s priorities. Based on the current plans, a total investment of USD400 billion is required in the transportation, energy, water and waste sectors over a five years period. While the government has allocated significant funding toward this goal, there is still a gap of USD150 billion to overcome.\nThis is where the private sector can come in and play an important role. That has not happened yet for various reasons, including the national political and regulatory environment, lack of healthy pipeline of high quality, green and inclusive bankable projects, and capacity limitations in the public, private, and financial sector.\nQ: Under the Green Growth Programme, GGGI, in cooperation with government agencies, will train 30,000 civil servants on green growth.\nAn important aspect of the Green Growth Programme is to build systems and capacity in ways that can be replicated. This is done through the establishment and operations of a web-based green growth knowledge platform hosted by the Indonesian ministry of national development planning, which will extend support to initiatives in other provinces beyond the two current pilot provinces of Central and East Kalimantan. The knowledge platform was launched in July, and will be further built upon over the next few years.\nGGGI is also working to strengthen capacity of stakeholders in the application of the extended cost benefit analysis tool, specifically in mainstreaming the tool into strategic environmental assessment methodologies, as part of the government of Indonesia’s development and spatial planning process.\nQ: In the first phase, GGGI worked with the Central and East Kalimantan provinces on several green programmes. How have the programmes developed?\nDistricts Murung Raya and Pulang Pisau in Central Kalimantan allocated USD8.8 million in 2015 to implement their green growth strategies, covering six key sectors:",

This is an ambitious target, but Indonesia is taking many steps to reach this. Even with all these efforts though, Indonesia is not yet on track to reach its targets.\nHowever, further strengthening of the earlier mentioned national policies and regulations in the land-use and energy sectors, including the moratorium on new forest and peatland concessions, peatland restoration, renewable energy mix targets, social forestry and degraded forest land rehabilitation, could bring Indonesia much closer to their target.",

        "prompt": "Imagine if your neighborhood grocery or convenience store offered one-hour, on-demand fulfillment — not through intermediaries like Postmates or Instacart, but entirely in-house — and made a profit on every order. As fantastical as the idea might seem, that’s the promise of CommonSense Robotics, an Israeli micro-fulfillment startup that today launched its first autonomous sorting and shipping center in downtown Tel Aviv.\nThe facility’s small footprint allowed it to squeeze into an underutilized real estate development previously considered too constrictive for warehouse infrastructure. But its size belies its efficiency, Goren said; thanks to a combination of robotic sorting systems and artificially intelligent (AI) software, it can prepare orders faster than the average team of human workers — typically in less than three minutes.\nCommonSense takes a hybrid approach to fulfillment. Robots within the center’s walls — overseen by AI that breaks orders down into tasks and autonomously delegates those tasks — bring items awaiting shipment in totes to teams of employees, who pack individual orders. Other robots move packaged orders to dispatch, where they’re loaded onto a scooter or van.\nCommonSense owns and operates the Tel Aviv center and charges retailers a fee per order.\n“I don’t see us as a robotics company. I see us as a software-driven company that uses robots to solve physical problems,” Goren said.\nThe micro-fulfillment center’s first beneficiary is Super-Pharm, Israel’s largest drugstore chain. It joins Israeli grocery retailer Rami Levy, which earlier this year inked a 12-site deal with CommonSense.\nCommonSense, which raised $20 million in a funding round led by Playground Global earlier this year, has its sights set on international expansion.

In the U.K., supermarket chain Ocado recently took the wraps off of a picking and packing robot that can grasp fragile objects without breaking them.

        "prompt": "IDEA: Four ads—with talking turtles, worker ants, mythical dwarf-like creatures and reptilian humanoids—all packed into one 30-second ad? You're going to need some bubble wrap for that. Yet BBDO in Toronto delivers it all in one piece in its latest amusing spot for FedEx. The ad aims to raise awareness of FedEx offerings beyond its core strengths. \"FedEx Canada is known as the gold standard in urgent and international shipping,\" said BBDO group account director Steve Groh. \"We want people to be aware of the other stuff—freight, small business and less-than-urgent.\" The ad's first three scenes focus on those three areas, with the twist being that each segment, beginning with the second, opens with characters watching the previous scene—or \"ad\"—on TV. The spot wraps with a fourth scene in which two humans remark on all three ads and their \"gimmicks\" before revealing a gimmick of their own—as a flick of an alien tongue and swing of a dinosaur tail suggest these guys aren't human after all.\nCOPYWRITING: The agency wrote a handful of scripts. \"This was the most ambitious by far, the one that scared us the most, and the one the client loved the most,\" said executive creative director Peter Ignazi.\nThe writers went back and forth on some of the creatures. But in all cases, they slyly reflect the services they're discussing—the turtles talk about non-urgent (i.e., slower) shipping; the ants want to haul freight; the dwarves are small-business men (in addition to being diminutive themselves). The writers had fun with the dialogue, too. \"My favorite line is when the one turtle says to the other, 'Don't be so quick to judge,'\" said Ignazi. \"It's the little, subtle things we hope people will get. One of the ants is called Anthony. Anywhere we could inject a little humor, we did.\" The spot wraps with the FedEx logo and tagline, \"Solutions that matter.\"\nART DIRECTION/FILMING: The Sons and Daughters directing team known as Peter Martin filmed the four scenes over two days in Toronto. The first scene was shot with animatronic turtles on a turtle-size set; the ant scene has CGI insects (from Aardman Animations) set against a human-size warehouse; the final two scenes are live action. There are lots of little visual jokes. \"Tortoise beats hare!\" reads a framed newspaper clipping in the turtles' office; the ants display a \"Best Picnic Spots\" map on the wall; and the dwarves have a circular door and medieval weaponry as decorations. \"These ads get a lot of airplay and a lot of sharing online, so it's good to give people little things to see the next time,\" said Ignazi.\nTALENT: The first two scenes lean on voiceovers—as younger workers chat with their superiors about shipping options. \"You",
        "baseline": " have to play in stereotypes to communicate stuff this quickly,\" Ignazi said. \"You have the gruff, older, seasoned guy who's been around for a while—an Ed Asner kind of guy for the turtle. And you have the newbie who needs to learn that FedEx is the answer to whatever the problem is.\" The voices are more blue-collar in the warehouse than in the office. The dwarves are normal-size actors in makeup and prosthetics who \"had to look good in big ears and beards,\" said Ignazi. The humans in the final scene are \"nondescript white-collar guys who roll up their sleeves and tape boxes,\" he added. \"Nothing really special. Just great actors.\"\nSOUND: The sound is mostly ambient office noise, except for the dwarf scene, which has ethereal flute-like music playing. The major sound challenge was to match up the voiceovers to the animatronics and animation in the first two scenes.",

        "prompt": "Short Cuts: Ruby Baby (BBC Radio 7) embraces a novel dramatic format. Louisa Young has penned a two-part thriller set in an organic Tuscan vineyard where a group of students are working as summer volunteers. It is, I should add, far less annoying than that description makes it sound. Between the two instalments – the first was broadcast on Monday, the second follows a week later – six young writers have responded with their own two-minute plays, speculating on what might have happened to Ruby, who goes missing on a night out.\nIt's rather good. The short plays are little more than moments, really, dripping with dramatic intensity. Yesterday's, by Indiana Seresin, focused on two of the party searching for Ruby in a dank cellar and managed, in this blink-and-miss-it sliver, to convey a real sense of foreboding. \"This feels like a maze,\" says Sarah, terrified of the dark. \"You city girls, always so jumpy,\" her colleague replies, ignoring the fact that they are in",

There are peculiar outbursts (\"You don't feed someone else's dog at table,\" the castle owner snaps at Ruby) and curious rituals: whenever they toast a drink, everyone has to stare into the eyes of everyone else in turn.\nThe shorter plays are like a welcome conversation with the main plot, amplifying and heightening elements of it. Heard in isolation they might sound very silly, but after the opener, they are tense reminders of it, underlining the menace and mystery. Obviously the thriller genre lends itself to this experimental format: the tiny plays each evening drip ominous clues and chilling reminders until the final denouement.",

        "prompt": "No Jobs at MacWorld: Apple Leadership Changes in the Wings?\nSteve Jobs absence from Macworld's keynote this year is being taken as a sign. What signal Apple is actually sending is debatable, but some analysts are taking a strong hint that the company is ready to transition leadership.\nApple said Tuesday that it will end its relationship with Macworld after this year and product marketing chief Phil Shiller will do the keynote (Techmeme). The company line is that Apple doesn't need Macworld (very true since big tradeshows are all but dead), but it's hard not to read between the lines here. There are multiple messages in the Apple-Macworld breakup.\nAnd one big message surrounds succession planning at Apple. Remember that Schiller and chief operating officer Tim Cook took center stage at an October event too. Cook even dressed like Jobs (right). That was hint No. 1 that Jobs is easing back a bit to set the stage for the new guard.\nOther folks can debate Jobs' health as a factorâ€\"some heavy hitter investors like Doug Kass voted with their greenbacks and bought Apple shares afterhours on the initial fall. Jobs' health, Macworld politics and other theories, however, really are the sideshow. The signs from Apple appear to be pointing to some sort of succession dance. Jobs is the face of Apple, but it's unclear how much longer that will last.\nWhat does Apple look like without Jobs?\nSteve Jobs remains CEO of Apple. Apple could have diffused speculation regarding Steve Jobs' health by having him keynote this year's Macworld. While we do not believe that this change provides any indication regarding Steve Jobs' health, we do believe that it is a sign that we are in the early stages of changing roles in Apple's management structure.\nMunster's argument makes sense although it may be better if Apple discloses some sort of succession plan, allays concerns about Jobs' health and puts a timeline on the process. Jobs has already noted that his demise is greatly exaggerated. He has also turned up on earnings conference calls to prove it. Yet the succession question persists. Succession plans can work wellâ€\"General Electric is an exampleâ€\"but shareholders need some sort of transparency.\nFrankly, Apple's process is a bit murky and the company needs better disclosure. Indeed, Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner downgraded Apple because it won't disclose or elaborate on a succession plan.\nMaybe (Jobs is) not feeling well, or maybe he just has nothing new to say. Whatever the reason, the unexpected announcement has underscored the greatest risk to Apple's long-term successâ€\"its dependence on Jobs' health and its apparent lack of a succession plan. Six months have passed since Jobs appeared at the Apple Developer Conference, looking drawn and unwell. It's past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power.\nReiner may be reachingâ€\"and Apple seemingly has allayed Jobs worries beforeâ€\"but he does capture the uncertainty reflected in shares.\nPerhaps Apple's best move would be to make Jobs chairman and name a new CEO. Set up the Bill Gates-Steve Ballmer arrangement at Microsoft followed by a slow victory lap for the chairman. If Apple's team is as strong as advertised the company should show its cards.\nWe believe that Apple's executive team is one of its competitive advantages. Led by CEO Steve Jobs, COO Tim Cook, CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and nine Senior Vice Presidents who share a collective track record of consistently outpacing their competitors in terms of hardware and software innovation coupled with robust product marketing and financial discipline. This management team, along with Steve Jobs, has been responsible for Apple's product innovation.\nThat's true, but you'd be a fool not to acknowledge the uncertainty.

The good news: Now is the time to plot the succession moves for Apple. The product cycle has never been stronger and Apple is in great shape.

That we were so materialistic and self-absorbed that we wouldn't act. That we might just -- all we'd do is sue 'em.\nThey didn't understand the true character of the American country, the nation. You see, we love freedom.\nWe love the freedom to worship the way we see fit. We welcome all faiths in America: Christian faiths, Jewish faith, Muslim faith. We welcome faith.\nWe believe in freedom to worship. We believe in freedom to speak out loud. We believe in freedom of the press.\nWe believe in free elections.\nWe believe in the dignity and worth of every individual. That's what we believe.\nAnd if somebody attacks those beliefs, we'll respond. That's the character of our country: It's that when we believe something, we stand up for it. We are slow to anger, but when angered, watch out.\nWe also are a nation that does not seek revenge. That's not in the American character as far as I'm concerned. We seek justice. We're a nation of justice.\nThis nation has also showed remarkable character in this way; we're patient. We're a patient nation, and we're a disciplined and focused nation. Americans understand that the new war of the 21st century -- the struggle for civilization itself -- is going to take a while.\nYou know, we live in an age where things happen so quickly that one of my concerns after September 11 was the farther we got away from September 11 the more grief that was behind us, that I thought the American people might forget that which is at stake. That's not the case, much to the chagrin of the killers who continue to want to bring harm to America.\nAnd our job is to stand strong so that our children and our children's children will know the freedoms that we knew growing up. That's what's at stake, my fellow Americans; at least that's how I view it. And so long as I'm the president, that's going to be the view of this government.\nIn six short months, we have made remarkable progress. We really have.\nYou know, I said early on, I said to the people, \"You're either with us or you're against us.\" I said, \"Either your standing with the United States of America in our quest and desire to protect freedom or you're not.\" There's no middle ground.\nAnd I'm proud to report the coalition -- there's been a vast coalition of nations that have joined us, nations of all stripes, all who understand what's at stake.\nI also said that, \"If you harbor a terrorist and you feed one, you're just as guilty as the murderers who came to New York City and Washington, D.C.\"\nAnd as a result of a great United States military and a military of many of our friends, we have liberated a country.\nIt's important for the young here to hear this: We didn't go into Afghanistan as conquerors. This great nation led a coalition of military folks to go into Afghanistan as liberators. It's hard for Americans to know and to believe, but many young girls were not allowed to go to school in Afghanistan because of the barbaric nature of the Taliban regime. But thanks to the United States and thanks to our friends and allies, girls now go to school in Afghanistan, for which I am mighty proud.\nThat is the character of the American people. We're plenty tough when we need to be. And we'll remain tough, but we're also compassionate. We care deeply about our fellow citizens in this world. We care deeply about the plight of children no matter where they may live. That's our nature.\nAnd that's how I feel about at home, too. I feel like out of this evil is going to come some incredible good. I believe that out of this evil will come peace in regions of the world that we never dreamt would be peaceful.\nIt's not going to be easy. And we're going to have to lead, and we're going to have to be diligent and resist and fight terror wherever we find it.\nBut there are -- we've got a good chance for a long-lasting peace. And at home, there's going to be some incredible good that comes out of this evil, because Americans have got great character, and Americans care for their neighbors.\n... find somebody to help. And I'm prepared to help you find somebody to help if you want to help.\nIf you want to find a way to help your country, that's what I'm here to talk about. There are all kinds of ways to help. Don't get me wrong. I mean, you can go to your church or synagogue and mosque and help a lot. You can help a lot. You can help a program -- devise a program to feed the homeless, help put a program together that goes into some of the pockets of despair in America and spread love, one person at a time. That's what you can do to help.\nService and volunteerism are an integral part of the American character. De Tocqueville discovered that years ago, and if he were to come back, he'd be just as proud of America now as he was then when it came to the willingness of our citizens to serve each other.\nYou know, I have been so impressed by the living spirit in America. It is unbelievable to see firsthand how alive this country has become, how focused our nation is on serving something greater than ourself.\nPerhaps it had to do with the vivid lesson of flight 93. Here we are, we're a nation kind of moving along thought oceans would separate us from any threats. Kind of, you know, we're, perhaps, in a culture of self-absorption.\nAnd all of a sudden people on an airplane call their loved ones and told them they loved them, said a prayer and sacrificed to save somebody else's life. To me, that was one of the most meaningful moments of September 11 and on.\nIt spoke of a spirit of America that recognizes there's something greater than ourselves, the need to serve our fellow mankind. These folks did it in the most courageous of ways, but we can do it in other ways as well here at home.\n... I asked Americans to give 4,000 years -- 4,000 hours over the next -- of the rest of your life, of service to America. That's what I asked. I said, 4,000 hours.\nNow, many of you already do that, so this is a drop in the bucket for you. I understand that, but many Americans don't. So 4,000 hours of service for the remainder of your life, I've set that as a goal and Americans are responding.\nMany of heard the call, and in order to channel that enthusiasm, we set up what's called the USA Freedom Corps and inside the USA Freedom Corps we're focused on three distinct areas: One is the Citizen Corps. I was in Knoxville, Tennessee yesterday heralding the Citizen Corps program.\nThis is a chance for people to help the police, the firefighters, and local emergency medical teams to respond to any disaster that might occur.\nAnd if you're interested in helping the brave men and women of the police force or fire force or emergency medical teams in your community, join, join the Citizen Corps. It is a way to help secure America and prepare America for a disaster if one should come.\nAnd then, of course, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps are an integral part of the USA Freedom Corps. These are programs that recognize that, in America, we can change our country one heart and one soul and one conscious at a time.\nYou see, I used to like to say that, government can hand out money, but what government cannot do is put hope in people's hearts. That requires a loving, hopeful person to do just that. And I view AmeriCorps and Senior Corps as ways to tap into the great talent and strength and compassion of America to help people in need.\nAnd then, we've got the Peace Corps. And the Peace Corps is a great way for Americans to help teach the world about the universal values that we hold dear, the true nature of America, which sometimes is distorted around the world. People don't have the true picture of our country, and one way to make sure they do is to have compassionate citizens go into communities all around the world to teach, to teach all kinds of things. But the most important lesson they teach is that we're a loving country, that we care deeply about the citizens of the world.\nAnd so, if you're interested in helping the country in those areas, you can all 1-887-USA-CORPS. Pick up your phone and dial.\nOr if you're one of these high-tech souls, usafreedomcorps.gov, and you'll find a way to help the country. This could give you a chance to participate.\nAnd this is just one way, I emphasize, one opportunity. And by the way, through this web site, you'll find other programs in the communities in which you live that will provide an outlet for your energy and your compassion.\nYou need to know that, just so people -- there is a gathering momentum of millions of acts of kindness that are taking place in the country. We've had 29,000 people requesting applications for the Peace Corps in six months.\nApplications to join AmeriCorps are up by more than 70 percent.\nTwenty five thousand people have signed up for the Citizen Corps.\nIn other words, Americans are responding. And for that, all of us are grateful. And of the things I'm here to talk about is how to expand America's service programs, and how to make them better, how to bring in new volunteers and at the same time make sure that which we're funding works, that we're actually meeting some goals. I look forward to working with the Congress. I'm going to talk with the members who are traveling back with me to Washington, D.C. after these events to talk about the reauthorization of these programs.\nIt's -- the discussions are going to be coming up this week, and so part of my speech is to lay the groundwork for how I think the reauthorization of these important federal initiatives should proceed. And one of the things is funding, of course. It's an important part of any process, and I've asked for $290 million in new funding for these programs for the year 2003.\nAnd I've also -- and it's to help meet these goals. 25,000 additional new AmeriCorps members, 25,000 more than we have now today all across the country. 100,000 new Senior Corps members, and 200,000 to 300,000 students in the federal work study program. That's what we're aiming at -- that's the goal we've set.\nSome say it is too ambitious. Nothing is too ambitious for America as far as I'm concerned.\nAnd here are some ways we can help make the programs more effective: First, by removing barriers that discourage seniors from joining the Senior Corps. Now remember the Senior Corps has got programs within it like the Foster Grandparent program, programs all aimed at using the talents of our seniors to help make citizens' lives better where people are losing hope, where despair is too common and too prevalent.\nNow under the current law, volunteers cannot join some Senior Corps programs until they reach the age of 60.\nAnd so, I chose 55, my age. I guess, I'm now eligible for Senior Corps if they finally give me a chance to participate.\nMy mother's not going to believe I'm eligible for Senior Corps.\nBut if we can get this through the Congress, I will be.\n... believe it or not: Some people are not allowed to participate in Senior Corps because they make too much money. That doesn't make any sense. And I'm confident that the congresspeople here recognize that we've got to make sure Senior Corps is open to as many people who are willing to put up their hand and say, \"I love America and I want to help.\"\nMany seniors participate in AmeriCorps, and that's good. That's what we want. Under a new proposal that I'm making to Congress: Seniors who join AmeriCorps should be able to earn what we call a Silver Scholarship. In other words, when you work for AmeriCorps, you get a scholarship if you're going to college. A senior who has already been to college should be able to earn that same scholarship and donate that to a member of their family if they so choose.\nIt makes sense to have older Americans helping younger Americans and, at the same time, helping their families, as well.\nI want to read this about a girl named Nicole (ph) who works in Baltimore. She's an AmeriCorps member. Perhaps some of the AmeriCorps members will understand what she's saying when I read this to you, \"None of it would have happened if I had not done AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps redirected my life forever. I know the direction my life is in: service to others, particularly the poor.\" This is Nicole's (ph) reflection upon what it meant to work for AmeriCorps. It is a beautiful spirit, an important spirit for America.\nAnd so we're trying to figure out ways to make sure that AmeriCorps is attractive to the young, to the Nicoles (ph) of the country.\nRight now, AmeriCorps members who complete a year of service receive an educational award worth up to $4,700. $4,700 that helps them go to school, and that's good. That's really good. Under the proposal I'm making is that award ought to be tax-exempt, and the $4,700 ought to have a cost-of-living adjustment. As well, we need to reform the federal work study programs. These are programs which encourage students to work off their federal loans. It makes sense, if you borrow money, that you ought to work them off. The fundamental question is how do we let them work it off? Right now 7 percent, only 7 percent, of the work study funds are required to be devoted to students who tutor, mentor, or perform other forms of service in their community: 7 percent.\nAnd so we think that we need to raise that number to 50 percent, to say that we recognize that an incredibly valuable contribution to our society is to allow 50 percent of the students to work off their federal loans by mentoring, by tutoring, by becoming involved in community programs which change America one person, one soul, one conscience at a time.\nOne of the things we hear is that governors and mayors and local authorities are frustrated by the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. I understand. I've been there myself. I had been frustrated when I was the governor of Texas with the bureaucracy in Washington.\nGoldsmith's job as well as Less (ph) the executive director, is to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and to trust the states and local authorities or to give the states and local authorities more flexibility as how do we apply this money to meeting the needs of these local folks.\n...it's important that Washington provide flexibility in selecting the groups in charities in which AmeriCorps volunteers will be placed.\nWe got to trust the local folks to understand local problems. You know, I like to tell people not all the wisdom of the world is in Washington, D.C.\nBut we also want to make sure people are held accountable. We want to make sure that when we spend money, that it meets needs. And so, Steve, and the good folks at the Corporation for National Community Service are going to develop clear standards and reasonable measures of performance so that we know whether or not we're being successful. I think that's really important. I think that's what the American taxpayer expects. They expect results and I expect results.\nAnd so if a program is failing, we ought to be willing to blow the whistle on failure. That's for the good of the people we're trying to help. And when a program is successful, we ought to be praising the program and its success and the people who are helping.\nIt is important, as well, that we make sure that we create a new standard of accountability for service-learning programs in America, too. The whole purpose of accountability in government is to make sure that we're succeeding. And in this case, we're aiming for a noble goal. And this is a hopeful America, a promising America, America that says clearly to everybody: This wonderful experience and this great land belongs to you, just as much as it belongs to somebody else.\nI've come to talk a little bit about the character of the country. And it's a character being defined by the moment at hand. History will look back at us, generations will look back at us, and I believe they're going to say, \"Thanks, thanks to the people who stood strong when it came to defending freedom, thanks to those who sacrificed in our military, thanks for the Congress to making sure the military had the resources necessary to take on a long struggle.\"\nListen, you just got to know there's no cave deep enough -- no cave deep enough -- for the long arm of American justice.\nThere is no calendar on my desk that says that, \"If so and so doesn't show up, then this thing ends.\" That's just not the way I think. But I'm a patient man and so is the American people, much to the chagrin -- much to the chagrin of the enemy that still wants to take us on. And we'll look back at the history of America, though, and believe it's going to happen, and say, what a fantastic period of time it was for kids to grow up in our country where we insisted upon quality education for every child, where there's after- school programs available, manned by loving citizens who put their arm around those who might seem hopeless and say, \"I love you a lot.\"\nThis will be a time in American history when those of us in Washington, D.C. or in the state capitals recognize that, oftentimes, the most helpful and promising programs of help come from places of worship. It doesn't matter what the religion is, people hear that universal call to love somebody just like they'd like to",

These emotions often come into play when customers think a long-time supplier is tilting the rules in its own favour.\nRogers Communications recently told customers with prepaid cellphone plans that it would confiscate balances above $150 if not used up by Dec. 31 of this year.\nThe change was relayed in a text message — not a letter or email — sent to Rogers and Fido prepaid customers.\n“Starting at the end of 2018, our prepaid services will have a maximum allowed balance of $150. Any balance over $150 will no longer be available as of end 2018,” the text said.\nI heard from two long-time Rogers phone customers, who felt the new policy was unfair, even unethical.\nJoanne Maley contacted me after trying to reach Rogers about the potential loss of her substantial $500 balance.\n“The hold times are wasteful,” she said. “The customer service representatives can’t help me and they don't escalate my very serious concern.\nUnder Rogers’ current policy, customers must deposit $100 a year to their prepaid accounts. The money is added to the remaining balance from previous years.\nFrank Roelofsen has a substantial balance of $850, which will be hard to use up in one year since he uses his prepaid phone only for emergencies.\n“I cannot see that simply erasing the unused value in my account, accumulated over the past 10 years in full compliance with Rogers’ own rules, is a legitimate business practice,” he told me.\nSpokesperson Samantha Grant said the $150 cap would help customers use the prepaid service in a better way without carrying or building up a large balance.\n“Over the next year, we will be in touch with impacted customers to help them use any balance that’s above the cap in a way that’s right for them,” she said.\nBoth of the customers who contacted me couldn’t wait to hear what Rogers had to offer. So, I helped connect them right away.\nRoelofsen was happy with the results.\n“Thank you for arranging a conversation with your Rogers contact, who assured me that the current balance in my account that is above the new $150 cap will not be arbitrarily removed,” he said.\nRecognizing that one year was not enough for him, Rogers extended the deadline to the end of 2019 and removed the $100 top-up normally required each year.\n“All in all, it was a very professional conversation,” Roelofsen said.\nMaley spent a week negotiating with Rogers before reaching a satisfactory outcome.
