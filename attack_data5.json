        "prompt": "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a depleted military, fighting all over the place,\u201d Trump said, words many people heard with excitement, misunderstanding him that this meant less war, and peace in our time, as he simultaneously vowed to boost defense spending.\nHe wants to do this, he says, so that America maintains military dominance, to \u201cward off any threats\u201d. But we know that when American presidents speak of \u201cwarding off threats\u201d they are speaking of nations that refuse to kowtow to them. They want to maintain their military dominance, not because of any threats, for no one threatens them except in their imagination, or on the fields of battle of the nations they have invaded and occupied, or themselves actively threaten, but because without that dominance they cannot break the arms of those that choose to live outside their shadow, nor bribe the rest, since loss of military dominance would mean the end of the hegemony of the dollar, whose inflated value depends on American military tyranny.\nThis aggressive policy he describes as \u201cPeace through strength,\u201d words that speak volumes about the thrust of the incoming president\u2019s foreign policy since it is the same phrase that Ronald Reagan used to justify the massive military buildup during Reagan\u2019s two terms in office that led, in part to the destruction of the Soviet Union.\nThis is the same policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d that saw Reagan try to overturn the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua, using the terrorists known as the \u201ccontras\u201d to tear Nicaragua apart until the Sandinistas were forced from power.\nThis is the same policy that saw the US supporting the suppression of the popular left movement in El Salvador where US death squads murdered thousands, and supporting the abduction and murder of thousands of leftists across Latin America in Operation Condor. In 1983 Reagan ordered the invasion and destruction of the socialist government of the tiny island of Grenada. He supported Baby Doc Duvalier in Haiti and his ton tons macoutes, Marcos in Philippines, the white apartheid government of South Africa, egged on both sides in the Iraq-Iran War while selling weapons to them both and used Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan to destroy its socialist government and harass the USSR there.\nTrump, in effect has just announced the official resumption of the Cold War, that euphemism for a heightened state of threat and insecurity provoked by the United States in order to intimidate the rest of the world and during which real wars take place while total war is daily threatened.\nThe evidence that American foreign policy will be just as aggressive with Trump as it would have been with Clinton is clear. Anyone who doubts it need only look at General \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis and his appointment as Secretary of Defence, and the appointment of another aggressive general, and head of military intelligence, Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser. He will appoint Marine General John Kelly to head of \u201cHomeland\u201d security. Another general, the disgraced Petraeus, is being considered as Director of National Intelligence, or as UN ambassador.\nTrump\u2019s continuation of America\u2019s belligerence was signaled with the insult to China when he accepted a call from the leader of the government of the Chinese province of Taiwan, the island to which the Kuomintang anti-communist forces fled in 1949. It has long been the policy of the United States to accept Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and therefore the US has no official diplomatic links with Taiwan as a sovereign state. The Chinese regard Taiwan as a rebel province and so any attempt by a foreign head of state to communicate with its government should go through Beijing. Trump deliberately threw that respect for China down the drain by openly talking with the Taiwanese leader who is known to want to make Taiwan independent. For the Chinese this was taken as a signal that the US recognizes Taiwan as independent, and the US meant it to be seen as such. The Chinese protested angrily and warned of trouble in reaction.\nAll the words of oil poured on these troubled waters by the Obama administration to reassure China that things will stay as they have been are meaningless since this phone call is just a natural and logical advancement of Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d that is the US intention to reduce China to a dependency or at least a vassal state that needs US permission to sail in its own waters while the Americans presume to own its seas and coasts.\nTrump\u2019s action is completely in line with the increasing aggression by the United States towards China evidenced by Obama\u2019s shifting of large portions of the American navy and air forces to the Pacific and South China Seas, including the transfer last summer of B1 and B2 bombers to Guam which can be used to carry nuclear tipped cruise missiles and by the routine violation of Chinese territorial waters by American warships all this year. The appointment of Iowa governor Branstad as US ambassador to China, a man who has connections in China, does not offer any real hope of Trump moderating American policy towards China. All that appointment means is that Branstad will be used as the nice cop while the US Navy sits off the Chinese coast waiting to come in as the bad cop if Branstad can\u2019t sweet talk the Chinese into surrendering their sovereignty.\nMeanwhile NATO aggression against Russia continues, \u201csanctions\u201d have increased and been renewed to a permanent state, and the anti-Russian propaganda, already at hysterical levels, is maintained with the appearance in the Washington Post of a list of news media, journals and blogs considered to be \u201cRussian agents.\u201d It is clear that this list was put together and released, through the device of a front group called Propornot, by American intelligence services.\nThis is a dangerous step and threatens further action aimed at suppressing the alternative media and writers that oppose US aggressive foreign policy and the regressive and cruel economic policies inflicted on the people of the United States by its industrial-financial ruling class. Already the media are full of stories about \u201cfake\u201d news and what is and what is not. We are now forced to continually defend ourselves as the ones writing about the real facts while the mass media put out the fabrications and distortions. It is difficult enough to get the facts out without having to defend against charges of serving the \u201cenemy\u201d while doing so.\nTrump\u2019s complaint that America is \u201cfighting in areas we shouldn\u2019t be fighting in\u201d is not a sign of a man of peace but of a man who has listened to those American military strategists who realize that the objective of trying to seize the oil supplies of Iraq, Iran and Russia through attacking the periphery of Asia is not working due to local resistance and help given to the resistance by Russia, China, Iran and others. So the strategy will shift further towards conflict with the larger powers that stand in the way of US global hegemony. Once they are neutralized then local resistance will be easier to deal with.\nThis is confirmed by the release by the Pentagon of its latest National Military Strategy, dated 2015, that states its primary purpose is to maintain an \u201cinternational order advanced by US leadership\u201d for the benefit of a \u201ca US economy in an open international economic system.\u201d It then lists the main obstacles to achieving this dominance, Russia, primarily, then China, Iran and North Korea, which are described as threats to American national interests.\n\u201cInternational order advanced by US leadership,\u201d means an American world order, that is American rule of the world, and for the sole benefit of American capitalism. The defeat of the US and EU in Syria will not lead to a lull in American imperialism. We must remember that the Reagan military build up to create \u201cpeace through strength\u201d was a reaction to the strategic defeat of the United States in Vietnam which in turn was partly due to Soviet assistance in the Vietnam war during which the Soviet air defence forces aiding the Vietnamese inflicted massive losses on American air forces.",
        "baseline": " The aftermath of that defeat was the build-up of US forces and we see the same thing promised now by Trump.\nWe can expect nothing from the new American regime except more of the same, more war, more world misery, more repression and increasing climatic disasters with the Trump appointment of Mr. Pruitt as head of the American Environmental Agency, a man who denies that climate change is due to man\u2019s industrial activity, and whose irrational and dangerous thinking will mean the end of any attempts to prevent the climate catastrophe that is unfolding around us.\nThose of us who struggle to attain some semblance of economic, political and social justice in the world must carry on regardless, carry on speaking, writing, and hoping that the young ones with the energy will see what needs to be done and do what needs to be done, take the power from those who abuse it.

So goes the old actors\u2019 saying, and sadly, some know from experience. Through the ages, actors, musicians, and other performers have gone out on a high note, leaving this mortal coil before the crowd could ask for an encore.\nBiggest controversy: Another old saying goes, \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people\u2014no, wait, that\u2019s stupid, of course they do.\u201d The \u201cbullet catch\u201d magic trick, which felled last week\u2019s subject, the white man who performed as Chung Ling Soo, has claimed many magicians. In 1820, Madame Delinsky was accidentally shot when one of the six (!) gunmen shooting at her mistakenly used a live round. In 1840, Arnold Buck gave a gun to a volunteer from the audience, who used a blank bullet per the trick, but also surreptitiously inserted nails into the gun barrel.\nGuns are deadly to non-magicians, too. In 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum was bored on the set of the TV series Cover Up, unloaded the blanks in a prop gun and amused himself by pretending to play Russian roulette. Except he had forgotten to unload one blank, and had the bad luck to spin the cylinder to that chamber. The force of the blank firing at close range was enough to kill him. And famously, Brandon Lee was killed in 1993 while filming The Crow when a prop gun was improperly loaded, causing a blank shot to propel a bullet stuck in the barrel from a previous misfire at Lee.\nNot all onstage gun deaths are accidental. Jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan was shot and killed on stage by his wife in 1972. Pantera guitarist \u201cDimebag\u201d Darrell Abbott was performing with his post-Pantera band, Damageplan, in 2004, when a gunmen leapt on stage, shooting and killing Abbott and three others. And in 2013, Brazil\u2019s \u201cKing Of Funk,\u201d MC Daleste, was shot in the abdomen in front of a crowd of 4,000 people, dying later that day.\nStrangest fact: One of the numerous traditional actors\u2019 superstitions (and for those of you out there reading, good luck, and\u2026 Macbeth!), the color green being bad luck dates back to one of the earliest recorded (at least, by Wikipedia) onstage deaths. French actor and playwright Moli\u00e8re, whose works are still performed at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise more than any other playwright, died in 1673 while starring in one of his own plays, Le Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac). Contrary to the title, Moli\u00e8re had a very real case of tuberculosis, had a violent coughing fit during the play, and died on stage. He was wearing green at the time, and the color has been bad luck ever since.\nThing we were happiest to learn: Not much to be happy about on a list of deaths, apart from some lives well lived. In 2016, Jane Little, a bassist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra collapsed at the end of a performance\u2019s final number, \u201cThere\u2019s No Business Like Show Business.\u201d No one knew that better than Little, who died at 87 after performing with the orchestra for 71 years. The following year, jam-band staple Colonel Bruce Hampton died on his 70th birthday, surrounded by friends and admirers, during an all-star concert to honor the occasion.\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Wrestling may be fake, but the danger is real. In 1969, Mike DiBiase (adoptive father of Ted \u201cThe Million Dollar Man\u201d DiBiase) died of a heart attack in the middle of a match. Three years later, Luther Lindsay, one of the first black pro wrestlers to become a major star, died while performing the winning move in a match. In 1987, British wrestler \u201cKing Kong\u201d Kirk died of a pre-existing heart condition when his opponent landed on him. In 1993, Larry Cameron died of a heart attack during a match. Japanese wrestler Mitsuhara Misawa and Mexican wrestler Perro Aguayo Jr. each suffered cervical spine injuries in the ring which led to immediate cardiac arrest and death. And in 1999, Owen Hart (brother and tag-team partner of Bret \u201cThe Hitman\u201d Hart) made his entrance to a pay-per-view event gliding down from the roof of the arena, when the safety harness released, dropping him 78 feet onto the ropes. His aorta tore, his lungs filled with blood, and he died shortly after.\nFurther down the Wormhole: Hard to",

Besides introducing a generation of viewers to wildlife of all sorts, Irwin was a devoted conservationist, working to protect endangered animals and habitat, and protesting poaching-derived items like turtle shells or shark fin soup.\nShark fins are usually fished by removing them from a shark and throwing its body back into the sea, and overfishing is endangering shark populations around the world. (While the movies make sharks out to be terrifying predators of humans, in fact the reverse is true, with sharks killing a single-digit number of humans each year and humans killing millions of sharks.)

        "prompt": "Here are the food-service offerings from several of the more popular airlines, along with Diet Detective\u2019s comments and ratings (Health score: 5 stars = highest rating.\nComments: The airline continues to improve upon its food and its transparency. VA has such a commitment to food, I just don\u2019t understand why it don\u2019t offer healthy individual snacks \u2014 nothing even close. How about an apple or an orange? I am impressed that the average meal has dropped by 24.38 calories. But calories aren\u2019t everything.\nBest bets: Avoid the individual snack if you can. Even the nuts, which are the best choice, are high in calories if you consume the entire package. Always choose a real meal if you can. Even if it\u2019s slightly more calories, it will keep you full longer.\nComments: Delta continues its commitment to improving its food in terms of health and consciousness. Over the summer, the airline launched new menus called Flight Fuel, which replaced the EATS program. The new menus attempt to focus on \u201ctransparency into ingredient and allergen information for customers.\u201d Along with the new Flight Fuel launch, Delta also upped its nutrition game this year by providing a key on the menu for snack items that are non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and lacto-ovo vegetarian. Also, the tapas box is the U.S. airline industry\u2019s only non-GMO snack box.\nDelta continues to work with Luvo (www.Luvoinc.com), which has a very strong commitment to healthy eating. All the calorie information for the Luvo items are listed on Delta\u2019s menu (and online); but be aware that the calories listed apply only to the individual sandwich or wrap, not the entire meal \u2014 which can be confusing if you don\u2019t see the asterisk.\nBest bets: For a snack, the nuts are the best choice \u2014 even over the lower-calorie pretzels. The vegan, gmo-free tapas snack box is a good healthy choice if you share or make it a meal (it\u2019s too high in calories as a snack). The best bests are the super seed crackers, Snapea Crisps, dark chocolate, almonds, hummus, and quinoa with pepper dip.\nComments: The individual snacks are still low in calories as well as nutritional value. The airline continues to post nutritional information for its meals, however, it doesn\u2019t post the nutritional information for snacks. The a la carte snacks are no longer available, but they were high in calories. Once an innovator in the air, JetBlue, the sixth-largest U.S. carrier, has certainly fallen behind in the food department. We need to see more foods like Chobani yogurt, and fewer Cheez-Its.\nBest bets: Still not too much in the way of healthy individual snacks. As for the meal boxes, we still like the Pump Up, which has healthy ingredients (Mary\u2019s Gone Crackers-Original, olives, hummus and bean crisps), but remember that it\u2019s a meal and should not be eaten as a snack (skip the olives if you are sodium sensitive). Skip the other meal boxes, which are high in calories and fat and offer little in terms of nutrition. If you are on a flight that offers the Eat Up Caf\u00e9, the yogurt and granola (you might want to limit the honey), the kale and quinoa salad and the spicy soba and Korean-style chicken are all good choices.\nComments: United\u2019s individual snacks are up in average calories from 283 to 375.6, but the overall calorie count for everything is only slightly higher. United is the fourth-largest airline in the U.S.; it should be thinking about healthy food. Years ago, it was No. 1 in this area. The breakfast, lunch and dinner menu has many new options; however, healthy meal choices are limited.\nBest bets: Among the individual snacks, the hummus is the best choice. Or else share the Sweet & Savory Bistro Blend Trail Mix with at least a few others. Get the tapas snack box, which is high in calories but has many healthy foods, including almonds, olives, hummus and bruschetta; just toss out the cheese spread. For breakfast, your best bet is the chicken sausage egg skillet, but skip the chicken sausage to save calories. Also, skip the ham baguette. For lunch/dinner, the airline removed last year\u2019s best bet, the wrap and salad combo. The new options are not great; however, the Mediterranean chicken wrap is your best bet and should keep you full.\nComments: American now provides complimentary snacks on flights of more than 250 miles \u2014 not healthy ones though. The average number of calories per meal has gone done, other than the snack boxes (398 to 497). Unfortunately, AA decided to remove the chicken Cobb salad, which was one of our Best Bets last year, and replaced it with a higher-calorie turkey and chutney sandwich.\nFurthermore, we were unhappy to find out that the Fort Worth-based airline decided not to publish food menu information on its website, a strange move leading to even less food transparency. The airline continues to lose out on what could be a tremendous financial opportunity \u2014 healthy foods often have larger profit margins and customers will be happier.\nBest bets: For individual snacks, the hummus and chips is still your best choice. Skip the snack box unless you toss the salami and cheese. The Thai ginger chicken wrap is a good choice, but skip the sesame-ginger dressing. For breakfast on flights of more than two but less than three hours, there\u2019s not much to eat; and while the trail mix may seem like a healthy choice, it\u2019s very high in calories. On flights of three hours or more, the breakfast sandwich is an OK choice as long as you go light on the honey mustard dressing.\nComments: Not much variety and not much in terms of nutritional value. We wish it would add some healthy snacks or at least test a few. The Dallas-based airline is one of the larger carriers in the U.S., so it would be great for Southwest to set an example and show that healthy food can sell if it is tasty and curated with consciousness.\nBest bet: The peanuts are the best, even though the pretzels are lower in calories. There haven\u2019t been many healthy changes to the menu, and don\u2019t be fooled by the word \u201cveggie\u201d in the wheat thins.\nComments: The airline\u2019s media spokesperson doesn\u2019t respond to emails or calls. Paraphrasing him from previous years: passengers should bring their own food and drinks. But in my opinion, the airline has a responsibility to serve foods that are healthier. The good news: The calorie count has gone down from last year to 366. The bad news is that there are few healthy options.\nBest bet: The cup of noodle soup at 290 calories is still the only choice that will feel like a real meal, but it is very high in sodium, so it is not the best bet for someone who is sodium-sensitive or has high blood pressure. All the muffins are at least 400 calories \u2014 not the best choices unless you split one (if you\u2019re the type of person who can do that). The chips and salsa is the lowest-calorie choice of all the snacks but probably won\u2019t fill you up. Skip the snack box.\nComments: The PR team was back with its typical nasty, condescending tone. Here is an abbreviated quote from the email: \u201cWithout",
        "baseline": " impeding operations I cannot go pillage through a catering carts while a plane is on the ground to take photos of these items, nor as we indicated can we get access to the catering kitchen \u2026 feel free to state that for the most recently added items (Chewy Candy \u2013 Spree, and the trail mix) the nutritional information was unavailable.\u201d Transparency is important, and people do care about the foods they eat. Also, calories and offerings are moving in the wrong direction. Calories are up over last year.\nBest bets: Perhaps the trail mix \u2014 but we had to estimate the calories and don\u2019t know the nutrient values. Also, if you\u2019re not sodium sensitive you can grab the jerky.\nVirgin America, 4.25 stars; Delta, 4 stars; JetBlue, 3.5 stars; United Airlines, 3.25 stars; American, 3 stars; Southwest Airlines, 2 stars; Spirit Airlines, 1; Frontier Air, 1 star.",

And the final count is likely to be even higher because 15 more suspicious deaths are still being investigated.\nIt\ufffds all about pressure and the military approach, said Kim Ruocco, 45, whose Marine husband was an officer and Cobra helicopter pilot who hanged himself in a California hotel room in 2005. That was one month before he was to return to Iraq a second time.\nShe said her husband, John, had completed 75 missions in Iraq and was struggling with anxiety and depression but felt he\ufffdd be letting others down if he sought help and couldn\ufffdt return.\nRuocco, of Newbury, Mass., was recently hired to be suicide support coordinator for the nonprofit Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. She said she feels that the military has finally started to reach out to suicide survivors and seek solutions.\n\ufffdThings move slowly, but I think they\ufffdre really trying,\ufffd Ruocco said.\nAt the Pentagon yesterday, Col.

It allows us to really target the unique needs that Canada has.\"\nProvinces and territories have long recognized the need for a public bank, said Nova Scotia Minister of Health and Wellness in announcing the investment.\nThere are currently more than 800 people who need a stem cell transplant in Canada, Smith noted.\nIt is estimated about 70 per cent of patients who require a stem cell transplant must look outside their families for a match and have the best chance of finding it within their own ethnic group. A national, public umbilical cord blood bank will improve the chance of finding high-quality cord blood for patients, according to CBS.\n\"Every year, I still encounter children even with the existing cord blood banks that I can't find a donor for,\" said Dr. John Doyle, who specializes in blood and marrow transplantation at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.\n\"I'm hoping by us going to our own community to get cord bloods that I will be able to find a donor for those children.\"\nThe national plan will be implemented over eight years, starting next month in Ottawa.

The three-year campaign aims to raise $12.5 million of the investment.\nParents will be able to choose to donate their children's umbilical cords anonymously to a public umbilical cord blood bank, making their donations available for any patient in need.\nOver the next two years, the blood agency will develop procedures to build the bank, and a cord blood stem lab will be established in Ottawa.\nThe project",
