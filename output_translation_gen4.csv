Explain the process of photosynthesis.,"Photosynthesis is a process that converts carbon dioxide and sugar water (glucose) using sunlight as energy.The equation for photosynthesis is: 6Co2 + 6H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2photosythesis occurs in plants and some bacteria and algae. It is the main source of oxygen on Earth, which makes it essential for most formsof life survive.","Photosynthesis is a reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water into sugar with the help of light. A water molecule is divided into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxyl radical. An electron is released from a water molecule, whichIt oxidizes a hydrogen atom with a proton. At the same time, a hydroxyl radical will be reduced with a hydrogen atom of a different water molecule. Carbon dioxide will react with a hydrogen ion to form a carboxyl group (an acidcarboxylic) .Trewater molecules will react with a carboxyl group to make a glucose molecule with three water molecules that are wasted. The electrons will return to where they began, making water again. All the water will return to where it began, making a molecule ofwater.The ribulous bisphosphate will decompose to make 3-PGA (three phosphoglyceracy) with a water that is wasted. Energy is needed in this step. The ribulous bisphosphate is composed of 2 ribulosis joints.They make a 2 water molecules together. Ribulous is a hexose sugar, which means that it has six carbons. Bisphosphate is added to make ribulous bisphosphate. The bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate isAdd at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 molecules of water together. The bisphosphate is added inboth ends, making a 2 water molecules together. Bisphosphate is added at both ends, making a 2 water molecules together.

What is Newton's first law of motion?,Newton's first law states that each object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless it acts by an external force.,"Newton's laws describe three basic concepts related to strength and movement, all were declared by Sir Isaac Newton in their work Philosophiæ Naturalis Mathematica published on July 5, 1687. Classically speaking, there are three laws that govern mechanics: aRelated to static balance, a uniform linear moving and one with accelerated movement. Classical mechanics can be extended to cover the movement close to the speed of light. Relativist mechanics is still based on these three laws, but take a different form.Debid to the nature of space-time near the speed of light, energy and impulse play key roles. While does not come to the speed of light, classical mechanics works well. But when you approach that speed, you must take into account relativity."

How does a refrigerator work?,"A refrigerator is a device that uses electricity to produce cold air. It flows a fluid called refrigerant through a system of coils and pipes. The refrigerant absorbs the heat inside the refrigerator, which cools food and other items stored inside.The heat absorbed by the refrigerant is released outside the refrigerator, where it can be dissipated in the atmosphere.The main components of a refrigerator include unchanged, condenser, expansion valve, evaporator and fan.The compressor is responsible for pumping the refrigerant through the system. The refrigerant, increasing its pressure and temperature. As the refrigerant passes through the condenser, releases heat to the surrounding air, which reduces its temperature.The expansion valve regulates the refrigerant flow to the evaporator. As the refrigerant expands in the evaporator, it absorbs the heat inside the refrigerator, which makes it colder.","A refrigerator is a device that uses a coolant to reduce the surrounding environment temperature. Although it might think that it is magical, refrigerators are really just one machine that transfers heat from one substance to another substance. A real example of the real world is aAutomobile engine. Refrigerant is like water in this example. Based on water such as refrigerant can take thermal energy from something hot, convert it into mechanical energy, use mechanical energy to convert something cold, then take thermal energy from something cold andconverting it into mechanical energy again. But water cannot come and go between liquid and gas many times. The refrigerant is different because it is a liquid at normal temperatures, but a gas when compressed with an engine and a fan.Water cannot change states like this, it needs much more power than a refrigerant to work. But water is easy to achieve, so it is used for large jobs. Refrigerants do not have to be done, they are found throughout nature.Even something as simple as drinking water has refrigerant.

How does a camera work?,"A camera is a device that captures images, typically digitally, and stores them on a memory or hard drive. The cameras can be used to take photos of landscapes, people, objects and other things. They can also be used to recordvideos.The main parts of a camera include lens, sensor, shutter, opening and focus mechanism. The lens focuses on the light on the sensor, which turns light into digital signals. The shutter controlto the sensor. The opening controls how much light enters the lens. The focus mechanism adjusts the distance between the lens and the sensor to ensure that everything is focused.",A camera uses a mechanical shutter to allow light to fall on a film. By blocking the passage of light with a shutter for a specific interval you control how much light you allow on your film. By using different shutter speeds you change the amount of light that falls on a piece of film you control the exposure of a scene on film.
